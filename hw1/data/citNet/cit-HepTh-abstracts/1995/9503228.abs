  Witten proposed that the low energy physics of strongly coupled D=10 type-IIA
superstring may be described by D=11 supergravity. To explore the stringy
aspects of the underlying theory we examine the stringy massive states. We
propose a systematic formula for identifying non-perturbative states in D=10
type-IIA superstring theory, such that, together with the elementary excited
string states, they form D=11 supersymmetric multiplets multiplets in SO(10)
representations. This provides hints for the construction of a weakly coupled
D=11 theory that is dual to the strongly coupled D=10 type IIA superstring.
