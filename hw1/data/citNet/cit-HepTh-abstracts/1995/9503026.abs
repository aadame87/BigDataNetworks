The Renormalization Group equation describing the evolution of the metric of
the nonlinear sigma model poses some nice mathematical problems involving
functional analysis, differential geometry and numerical analysis. In this
article we briefly report some results obtained from the numerical study of the
solutions in the case of a two dimensional target space (deformation of the
$O(3)$ sigma model). In particular, our analysis shows that the so-called
sausages define an attracting manifold in the $U(1)$-symmetric case, at
one-loop level. Moreover, data from two-loop evolution are used to test the
association put forward in Nucl. Phys., B406 (1993) 521 between the so-called
$SSM_{\nu}$ field theory and a certain $U(1)$-symmetric, factorized scattering
theory (FST).
