  We analyze the relation between rigid and local supersymmetric N=2 field
theories, when half of the supersymmetries are spontaneously broken. In
particular, we show that the recently found partial supersymmety breaking
induced by electric and magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos terms in rigid theories can
be obtained by a suitable flat limit of previously constructed N=2 supergravity
models with partial super-Higgs in the observable sector.
