  Following a remark advanced by Feynman,we study the connection between the
form of the nonlinear vertices involving gauge particles and the Abelian gauge
invariance of physical tree amplitudes. We show that this requirement, together
with some natural assumptions, fixes uniquely the structure of the Yang-Mills
theory. However, the constraints imposed by the above property are not
sufficient to single out the gauge theory of gravitation.
