  We critically analyze the introduction of an independent zero momentum mode
field renormalization for Phi4. It leads to an infrared divergent effective
action. It does not achieve its purpose: triviality still gives massless
particles in the broken phase in the continuum limit. It leads to an effective
potential which is not the low energy limit of the effective action.
