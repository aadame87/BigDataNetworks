Title: Why some stars seem to be older than the Universe?

There is some experimental evidence that some stars are older than the Universe
in General Relativity based cosmology. In TGD based cosmology the paradox has
explanation. Photons can be either topologically condensed on background
spacetime surface or in 'vapour phase' that is progate in $M^4_+\times CP_2$ as
small surfaces. The time for propagation from A to B is in general larger in
condensate than in vapour phase. In principle observer detects from a given
astrophysical object both vapour phase and condensate photons, vapour phase
photons being emitted later than condensate photons. Therefore the erraneous
identification of vapour phase photons as condensate photons leads to an over
estimate for the age of the star and star can look older than the Universe. The
Hubble constant for vapour phase photons is that associated with $M^4_+$ and
smaller than the Hubble constant of matter dominated cosmology. This could
explain the measured two widely different values of Hubble constant if smaller
Hubble constant corresponds to the Hubble constant of the future light cone
$M^4_+$. The ratio of propagation velocities of vapour phase and condensate
photons equals to ratio of the two Hubble constants, which in turn is depends
on the ratio of mass density and critical mass density, only. Anomalously large
redshifts are possible since vapour phase photons can come also from region
outside the horizon.
