Title: The low energy effective Lagrangian for photon interactions in any
  dimension
Authors: A. Ritz and R. Delbourgo
Comments: In the revised version, the results have been expressed in terms of
  Bernoulli polynomials instead of generalized zeta functions; they agree for
  spinor QED with those of Schubert and Schmidt (obtained differently by path
  integral methods).

  The subject of low energy photon-photon scattering is considered in arbitrary
dimensional space-time and the interaction is widened to include scattering
events involving an arbitrary number of photons. The effective interaction
Lagrangian for these processes in QED has been determined in a manifestly
invariant form. This generalisation resolves the structure of the weak-field
Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian and indicates that the component invariant
functions have coefficients related, not only to the space-time dimension, but
also to the coefficients of the Bernoulli polynomial.
