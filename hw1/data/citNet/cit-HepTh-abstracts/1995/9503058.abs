  We propose a nonperturbative formulation of chiral gauge theories. The method
involves a `pre-regulation' of the gauge fields, which may be implemented on a
lattice, followed by a computation of the chiral fermion determinant in the
form of a functional integral which is regularized in the continuum. Our result
for the chiral determinant is expressed in terms of the vector-like Dirac
operator and hence can be realized in lattice simulations. We investigate the
local and global anomalies within our regularization scheme. We also compare
our result for the chiral determinant to previous exact $\zeta$-function
results. Finally, we use a symmetry property of the chiral determinant to show
that the partition function for a chiral gauge theory is real.
