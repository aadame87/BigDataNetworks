We study two--loop renormalization in $(2+\epsilon)$--dimensional quantum
gravity. As a first step towards the full calculation, we concentrate on the
divergences which are proportional to the number of matter fields. We calculate
the $\beta$ functions and show how the nonlocal divergences as well as the
infrared divergences cancel among the diagrams. Although the formalism includes
a subtlety concerning the general covariance due to the dynamics of the
conformal mode, we find that the renormalization group allows the existence of
a fixed point which possesses the general covariance. Our results strongly
suggest that we can construct a consistent theory of quantum gravity by the
$\epsilon$ expansion around two dimensions.
