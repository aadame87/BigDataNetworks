  Using Schwinger's quantum action principle, dispersion relations are obtained
for neutral scalar mesons interacting with bi-local sources. These relations
are used as the basis of a method for representing the effect of interactions
in the Gaussian approximation to field theory, and it is argued that a marked
inhomogeneity, in space-time dependence of the sources, forces a discrete
spectrum on the field. The development of such a system is characterized by
features commonly associated with chaos and self-organization (localization by
domain or cell formation). The Green functions play the role of an iterative
map in phase space. Stable systems reside at the fixed points of the map. The
present work can be applied to self-interacting theories by choosing suitable
properties for the sources. Rapid transport leads to a second order phase
transition and anomalous dispersion. Finally, it is shown that there is a
compact representation of the non-equilibrium dynamics in terms of generalized
chemical potentials, or equivalently as a pseudo-gauge theory, with an
imaginary charge. This analogy shows, more clearly, how dissipation and entropy
production are related to the source picture and transform a flip-flop like
behaviour between two reservoirs into the Landau problem in a constant
`magnetic field'. A summary of conventions and formalism is provided as a basis
for future work.
