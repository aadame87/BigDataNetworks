A two dimensional string effective action is obtained by dimensionally reducing
the bosonic part of the ten dimensional heterotic string effective action. It
is shown that this effective action, with a few restrictions on some
backgrounds describes a two dimensional model which admits an infinite sequence
of nonlocal conserved currents.
