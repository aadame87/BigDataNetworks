Starting from string field theory for 2d gravity coupled to c=1 matter we
analyze N-point off-shell tree amplitudes of discrete states. The amplitudes
exhibit the pole structure and we use the oscillator representation to extract
the residues. The residues are generated by a simple effective action. We show
that the effective action can be directly deduced from a string field action in
a special transversal-like gauge.
