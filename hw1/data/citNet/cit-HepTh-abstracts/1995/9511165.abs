  $ \hat {U}(1)$ Kac-Moody gauge fields have the infinite dimensional $
\hat{U}(1)$ Kac-Moody group as their gauge group. The pure gauge sector, unlike
the usual $U(1)$ Maxwell lagrangian, is nonlinear and nonlocal; the Euclidean
theory is defined on a $d+1$-dimensional manifold $ {\cal{R}}_d \times
{\cal{S}}^1 $ and hence is also asymmetric. We quantize this theory using the
background field method and examine its renormalizability at one-loop by
analyzing all the relevant diagrams. We find that, for a suitable choice of the
gauge field propagators, this theory is one-loop renormalizable in $3+1$
dimensions. This pure abelian Kac-Moody gauge theory in $3+1$ dimensions has
only one running coupling constant and the theory is asymptotically free. When
fermions are added the number of independent couplings increases and a richer
structure is obtained. Finally, we note some features of the theory which
suggest its possible relevance to the study of anisotropic condensed matter
systems, in particular that of high-temperature superconductors.
