  We analyse in detail the local BRST cohomology in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory
using the antifield formalism. We do not restrict the Lagrangian to be the sum
of the standard Hilbert and Yang-Mills Lagrangians, but allow for more general
diffeomorphism and gauge invariant actions. The analysis is carried out in all
spacetime dimensions larger than 2 and for all ghost numbers. This covers the
classification of all candidate anomalies, of all consistent deformations of
the action, as well as the computation of the (equivariant) characteristic
cohomology, i.e. the cohomology of the spacetime exterior derivative in the
space of (gauge invariant) local differential forms modulo forms that vanish
on-shell. We show in particular that for a semi-simple Yang-Mills gauge group
the antifield dependence can be entirely removed both from the consistent
deformations of the Lagrangian and from the candidate anomalies. Thus, the
allowed deformations of the action necessarily preserve the gauge structure,
while the only candidate anomalies are those provided by previous works not
dealing with antifields, and by ``topological" candidate anomalies which are
present only in special spacetime dimensions (6,9,10,13,...). This result no
longer holds in presence of abelian factors where new candidate anomalies and
deformations of the action can be constructed out of the conserved Noether
currents (if any). The Noether currents themselves are shown to be
covariantizable, with a few exceptions discussed as well.
