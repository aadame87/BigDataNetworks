Title: Functional determinants on Moebius corners
Authors: J.S.Dowker
Comments: 11p,PlainTeX
Report-no: MUTP/95/17
\\
  A general method of finding functional determinants is presented that depends
on the asymptotic behaviour of the resolvent. Its application to the case of a
bounded trihedral corner for which the eigenvalues are known only implicitly is
outlined and a generalisation of Barnes' product form of multiple gamma
functions is given
\\
