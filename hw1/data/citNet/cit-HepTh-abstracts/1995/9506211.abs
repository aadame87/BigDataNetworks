  We study the effect of nonzero temperature on the induced electric charge
around a Dirac monopole. While at zero temperature the charge is known to be
proportional to a CP violating $\theta$ parameter, we find that at high
temperature the charge is proportional to sin $\theta$. Other features of the
charge at nonzero temperature are discussed. We also compute the induced charge
at nonzero temperature around an Aharonov-Bohm flux string in $2+1$ dimensions
and compare the result with an index theorem, and also with the
electron-monopole problem in $3+1$ dimensions.
