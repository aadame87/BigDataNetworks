  We consider the relativistic statistical mechanics of an ensemble of $N$
events with motion in space-time parametrized by an invariant ``historical
time'' $\tau .$ We generalize the approach of Yang and Yao, based on the Wigner
distribution functions and the Bogoliubov hypotheses, to find the approximate
dynamical equation for the kinetic state of any nonequilibrium system to the
relativistic case, and obtain a manifestly covariant Boltzmann-type equation
which is a relativistic generalization of the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU)
equation for indistinguishable particles. This equation is then used to prove
the $H$-theorem for evolution in $\tau .$ In the equilibrium limit, the
covariant forms of the standard statistical mechanical distributions are
obtained. We introduce two-body interactions by means of the direct action
potential $V(q),$ where $q$ is an invariant distance in the Minkowski
space-time. The two-body correlations are taken to have the support in a
relative $O( 2,1)$-invariant subregion of the full spacelike region. The
expressions for the energy density and pressure are obtained and shown to have
the same forms (in terms of an invariant distance parameter) as those of the
nonrelativistic theory and to provide the correct nonrelativistic limit.
