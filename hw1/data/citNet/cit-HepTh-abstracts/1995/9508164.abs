Title: The Tolman ``Antitelephone'' Paradox: Its Solution by Tachyon Mechanics
Authors: Erasmo Recami
\\
  Some recent experiments led to the claim that something can travel faster
than light in vacuum. However, such results do not seem to place relativistic
causality in jeopardy. Actually, it is possible to solve also the known causal
paradoxes, devised for ``faster than $c$" motion: even if this is not widely
recognized. Here we want to show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the
oldest causal paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of so
many further tachyon paradoxes. The key to the solution is a careful
application of {\em tachyon mechanics}, that can be unambiguously derived from
special relativity.
