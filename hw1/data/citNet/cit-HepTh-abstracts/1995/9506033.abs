  The $\kappa$--anomaly cancellation mechanism in the heterotic superstring
determines the superspace constraints for N=1, D=10
Supergravity--Super--Yang--Mills theory. We point out that the constraints
found recently in this way appear to disagree with superspace solutions found
in the past. We solve this puzzle establishing perfect agreement between the
two methods.
