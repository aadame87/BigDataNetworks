  We analyze the theory of softly broken supersymmetric $QCD$. Exotic behavior
like spontaneously broken baryon number, massless composite fermions and
Seiberg's duality seems to persist also in the presence of (small) soft
supersymmetry breaking. We argue that certain, specially tailored, lattice
simulations may be able to detect the novel phenomena. Most of the exotic
behavior does not survive the decoupling limit of large SUSY breaking
parameters.
