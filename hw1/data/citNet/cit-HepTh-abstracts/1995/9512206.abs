  Quantization of free string field theory in the Rindler space-time is studied
by using the covariant formulation and taking the center-of-mass value of the
Rindler string time-coordinate $\eta(\sigma)$ as the time variable for
quantization. We construct the string Rindler modes which vanish in either of
the Rindler wedges $\pm$ defined by the Minkowski center-of-mass coordinate of
the string. We then evaluate the Bogoliubov coefficients between the Rindler
string creation/annihilation operators and the Minkowski ones, and analyze the
string thermalization. An approach to the construction of the string Rindler
modes corresponding to different definitions of the wedges is also presented
toward a thorough understanding of the structure of the Hilbert space of the
string field theory on the Rindler space-time.
