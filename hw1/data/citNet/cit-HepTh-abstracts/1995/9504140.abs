  We present a geometric formulation of super $p$--brane theories in which the
Wess--Zumino term is $(p+1)$--th order in the supersymmetric currents, and
hence is manifestly supersymmetric. The currents are constructed using a
supergroup manifold corresponding to a generalization of a superalgebra which
we found sometime ago. Our results generalize Siegel's analogous reformulation
of the Green--Schwarz superstring. The new superalgebras we construct underly
the free differential superalgebras introduced by de Azc\'arraga and Townsend a
few years ago.
