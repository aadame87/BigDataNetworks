  It is shown that the minimal Higgs sector of a generic N=2 supergravity
theory with unbroken N=1 supersymmetry must contain a Higgs hypermultiplet and
a vector multiplet. When the multiplets parametrize the quaternionic manifold
SO(4,1)/SO(4), and the special Kahler manifold SU(1,1)/U(1), respectively, a
vanishing vacuum energy with a sliding massive spin 3/2 multiplet is obtained.
Potential applications to N=2 low energy effective actions of superstrings are
briefly discussed.
