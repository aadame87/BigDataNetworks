Title: Partition Function of a Quadratic Functional and Semiclassical
  Approximation for Witten's 3-Manifold Invariant
Authors: David H. Adams and Siddhartha Sen
Comments: Some typo's are corrected. One of these which may have caused
  confusion is in the chain of maps at the top of page 22 (or bottom of page 21
  in the first version), where --Gamma1--T1--Gamma--T1*--Gamma1-- should have
  been --Gamma1--T1--Gamma--T--Gamma--T1*--Gamma1--. (latex, 56p.)

  An extension of the method and results of A. Schwarz for evaluating the
partition function of a quadratic functional is presented. This enables the
partition functions to be evaluated for a wide class of quadratic functionals
of interest in topological quantum field theory, for which no other method has
previously been available. In particular it enables the partition functions
appearing in the semiclassical approximation for the Witten-invariant to be
evaluated in the most general case. The resulting k-dependence is precisely
that conjectured by D. Freed and R. Gompf.
