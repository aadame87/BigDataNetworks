  Complete energy spectrum is obtained for the quantum mechanical problem of N
one dimensional equal mass particles interacting via potential
$$V(x_1,x_2,...,x_N) = g\sum^N_{i < j}{1\over (x_i-x_j)^2} - {\alpha\over
\sqrt{\sum_{i < j} (x_i-x_j)^2}}$$ Further, it is shown that scattering
configuration, characterized by initial momenta $p_i (i=1,2,...,N)$ goes over
into a final configuration characterized uniquely by the final momenta $p'_i$
with $p'_i=p_{N+1-i}$.
