  We consider representations of meromorphic bosonic chiral conformal field
theories, and demonstrate that such a representation is completely specified by
a state within the theory. The necessary and sufficient conditions upon this
state are derived, and, because of their form, we show that we may extend the
representation to a representation of a suitable larger conformal field theory.
In particular, we apply this procedure to the lattice (FKS) conformal field
theories, and deduce that Dong's proof of the uniqueness of the twisted
representation for the reflection-twisted projection of the Leech lattice
conformal field theory generalises to an arbitrary even (self-dual) lattice. As
a consequence, we see that the reflection-twisted lattice theories of Dolan et
al are truly self-dual, extending the analogies with the theories of lattices
and codes which were being pursued. Some comments are also made on the general
concept of the definition of an orbifold of a conformal field theory in
relation to this point of view.
