Decoherence in quantum systems which are classically chaotic is studied.
It is well-known that a classically chaotic system when quantized
loses many prominent chaotic traits. We show that interaction of the quantum
system with an environment can under general circumstances quickly diminish
quantum coherence and reenact some characteristic classical chaotic behavior.
We use the Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism to study the effect of
an ohmic environment at high temperature on two classically-chaotic systems:
The linear Arnold cat map (QCM) and the nonlinear quantum kicked rotor (QKR).
Features of quantum chaos such as recurrence in QCM and diffusion suppression
leading to localization in QKR are destroyed in a short time due to
environment-induced decoherence. Decoherence also undermines localization and
induces an apparent transition from reversible to irreversible dynamics in
quantum chaotic systems.
