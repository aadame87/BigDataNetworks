  We discuss two issues regarding the question of degrees of freedom in two
dimensional string theory. The first issue relates to the classical limit of
quantum string theory. In the classical theory one requires an infinite number
of fields in addition to the collective field to describe ``folds'' on the
fermi surface. We argue that in the quantum theory these are not additional
degrees of freedom. Rather they represent quantum dispersions of the collective
field which are {\em not} suppressed when $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ whenever a fold
is present, thus leading to a nontrivial classical limit. The second issue
relates to the ultraviolet properties of the geometric entropy. We argue that
the geometric entropy is finite in the ultraviolet due to {\em nonperturbative}
effects. This indicates that the true degrees of freedom of the two dimensional
string at high energies is much smaller than what one naively expects.
