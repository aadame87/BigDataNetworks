  The Kerr solution to axidilaton gravity is analyzed in the
Debney--Kerr--Schild formalism. It is shown that the Kerr principal null
congruence retains its property to be geodesic and shear free, however, the
axidilatonic Kerr solution is not algebraically special. A limiting form of
this solution is considered near the ring-like Kerr singularity. This limiting
solution coincides with the field around a fundamental heterotic string
obtained by Sen.
