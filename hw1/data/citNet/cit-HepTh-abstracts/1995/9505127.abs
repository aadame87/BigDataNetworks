  We derive a Kontsevich-type matrix model for the c=1 string directly from the
W-infinity solution of the theory. The model that we obtain is different from
previous proposals, which are proven to be incorrect. Our matrix model contains
the Penner and Kontsevich cases, and we study its quantum effective action. The
simplicity of our model leads to an encouraging interpretation in the context
of background-independent noncritical string field theory.
