  We study in detail gaugino condensation in globally and locally
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We focus on models for which gauge-neutral
matter couples to the gauge bosons only through nonminimal gauge kinetic terms,
for the cases of one and several condensing gauge groups. Using only symmetry
arguments, the low-energy expansion, and general properties of supersymmetry,
we compute the low energy Wilson action, as well as the (2PI) effective action
for the composite {\it classical} superfield $U\equiv\langle \Tr\WW \rangle$,
with $W_\alpha$ the supersymmetric gauge field strength. The 2PI effective
action provides a firmer foundation for the approach of Veneziano and
Yankielowicz, who treated the composite superfield, $U$, as a quantum degree of
freedom. We show how to rederive the Wilson action by minimizing the 2PI action
with respect to $U$. We determine, in both formulations and for global and
local supersymmetry, the effective superpotential, $W$, the non-perturbative
contributions to the low-energy K\"ahler potential $K$, and the leading higher
supercovariant derivative terms in an expansion in inverse powers of the
condensation scale. As an application of our results we include the string
moduli dependence of the super- and K\"ahler potentials for simple orbifold
models.
