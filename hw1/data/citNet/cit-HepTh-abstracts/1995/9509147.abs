  A discussion of an extended class of higher-derivative classical theories of
gravity is presented. A procedure is given for exhibiting the new propagating
degrees of freedom, at the full non-linear level, by transforming the
higher-derivative action to a canonical second-order form. For general
fourth-order theories, described by actions which are general functions of the
scalar curvature, the Ricci tensor and the full Riemann tensor, it is shown
that the higher-derivative theories may have multiple stable vacua. The vacua
are shown to be, in general, non-trivial, corresponding to deSitter or
anti-deSitter solutions of the original theory. It is also shown that around
any vacuum the elementary excitations remain the massless graviton, a massive
scalar field and a massive ghost-like spin-two field. The analysis is extended
to actions which are arbitrary functions of terms of the form $\nabla^{2k}R$,
and it is shown that such theories also have a non-trivial vacuum structure.
