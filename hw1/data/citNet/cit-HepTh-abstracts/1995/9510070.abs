  We consider the soliton solutions in 1- and (1+1)-dimensional Toda lattice
models with a boundary. We make use of the solutions already known on a full
line by means of the Hirota's method. We explicitly construct the solutions
satisfying the boundary conditions. The ${\bf Z}_{\infty}$-symmetric boundary
condition can be introduced by the two-soliton solutions naturally.
