  A new type of semigroups which appears while dealing with $N=1$
superconformal symmetry in superstring theories is considered. The ideal series
having unusual abstract properties is constructed. Various idealisers are
introduced and studied. The ideal quasicharacter is defined. Green's relations
are found and their connection with the ideal quasicharacter is established.
