  The self-gravitational correction of the ultraviolet-divergent second- order
"vacuum polarization" radiative correction insertion Feynman diagram is carried
out using full, self-consistent Einstein equation propagation of the
intermediate virtual gravitons, which takes into account their important
non-linear interactions with each other. (As a by-product, the subsequent
perturbative treatment of these non-linearities is avoided, which eliminates
the source of the ultraviolet divergences of the second- quantized gravity
theory itself.) The corrected diagram is finite, makes no contribution to
charge renormalization (as could be expected of a diagram involving but a
single transient virtual pair), and its dynamical behaviour accords with the
standard quantum electrodynamics result except at inaccessibly extreme
(Planck-scale-related) values of the momentum transfer. There, the standard
logarithmic rise with momentum transfer which this diagram contributes to the
effective coupling strength falls away, as the diagram proceeds instead to
decrease strongly toward zero. The same self-gravitational correction is made
to the closely related quartically divergent second-order vacuum-to-vacuum
amplitude correction Feynman diagram, and it is found that the result vanishes
identically.
