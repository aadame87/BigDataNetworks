  The Weierstrassian $\wp, \zeta$ and $\sigma $ functions are generalized to
${\bf R}^{n}$. The $n=3$ and $n=4$ cases have already been used in
gravitational and Yang-Mills instanton solutions which may be interpreted as
explicit realizations of spacetime foam and the monopole condensate,
respectively. The new functions satisfy higher dimensional versions of the
periodicity properties and Legendre's relations obeyed by their familiar
complex counterparts. For $n=4$, the construction reproduces functions found
earlier by Fueter using quaternionic methods. Integrating over lattice points
along all directions but two, one recovers the original Weierstrassian elliptic
functions.
