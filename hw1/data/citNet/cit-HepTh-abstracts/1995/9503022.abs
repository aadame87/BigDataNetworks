Proper symmetries act on fields while pseudo-symmetries act on both fields and
coupling constants. We identify the pseudo-duality groups that act as
symmetries of the equations of motion of general systems of scalar and vector
fields and apply our results to $N=2,4$ and $8$ supergravity theories. We
present evidence that the pseudo-duality group for both the heterotic and type
II strings toroidally compactified to four dimensions is $Sp(56;\Z)\times D$,
where $D$ is a certain subgroup of the diffeomorphism group of the scalar field
target space. This contains the conjectured heterotic $S\times T$ or type II
$U$ proper duality group as a subgroup.
