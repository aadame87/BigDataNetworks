Two dimensional quantum R$^2$-gravity and its phase structure are examined in
the semiclassical approach and compared with the results of the numerical
simulation. Three phases are succinctly characterized by the effective action.
A classical solution of R$^2$-Liouville equation is obtained by use of the
solution of the ordinary Liouville equation. The partition function is obtained
analytically. A toatal derivative term (surface term) plays an important role
there. It is shown that the classical solution can sufficiently account for the
cross-over transition of the surface property seen in the numerical simulation.
