  We construct exact wavefunctions of two vortices on a plane, a single vortex
on the cylinder and a vortex on the torus. In each case, the physics is shown
to be equivalent to a particle moving in a covering space, something simple to
solve in those examples. We describe how our solutions fit into the general
theory of quantum mechanics of $N$ particles on a two-dimensional space and
attribute our success to the fact that the fundamental groups are Abelian in
those simple cases that we are considering.
