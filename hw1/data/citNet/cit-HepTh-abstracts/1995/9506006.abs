  Report in extended abstract form. Based on talk given at Strings '95, Los
Angeles, CA. This is a summary of the findings initially presented in
hep-th/9505080. Results of a step (the complete classification of free
fermionic solutions to $N=1$ spacetime) in the search for stringy
three-generation SO(10) SUSY-GUTs are reviewed.
