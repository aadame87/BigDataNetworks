  We construct two classes of higher-derivative supergravity theories
generalizing Einstein supergravity. We explore their dynamical content as well
as their vacuum structure. The first class is found to be equivalent to
Einstein supergravity coupled to a single chiral superfield. It has a unique
stable vacuum solution except in a special case, when it becomes identical to a
simple no-scale theory. The second class is found to be equivalent to Einstein
supergravity coupled to two chiral superfields and has a richer vacuum
structure. It is demonstrated that theories of the second class can possess a
stable vacuum with vanishing cosmological constant that spontaneously breaks
supersymmetry. We present an explicit example of this phenomenon and compare
the result with the Polonyi model.
