  We give a brief introduction to the study of the algebraic structures -- and
their geometrical interpretations -- which arise in the BRST construction of a
conformal string background. Starting from the chiral algebra $\cA$ of a string
background, we consider a number of elementary but universal operations on the
chiral algebra. From these operations we deduce a certain fundamental odd
Poisson structure, known as a Gerstenhaber algebra, on the BRST cohomology of
$\cA$. For the 2D string background, the correponding G-algebra can be
partially described in term of a geometrical G-algebra of the affine plane
$\bC^2$. This paper will appear in the proceedings of {\it Strings 95}.
