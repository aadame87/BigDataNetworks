  We study the symmetries of the two dimensional Heterotic string theory by
following the approach of Kinnersley et al for the study of stationary-axially
symmetric Einstein-Maxwell equations. We identify the finite dimensional groups
$G'$ and $H'$ for the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We also give the
constructions for the infinite number of conserved currents and the affine
$\hat{o}(8, 24)$ symmetry algebra in this formulation. The generalized Ehlers
and Harrison transformations are identified and a parallel between the infinite
dimensional symmetry algebra for the heterotic string case with $\hat{sl}(3,
R)$ that arise in the case of Einstein-Maxwell equations is pointed out.
