  We give a systematic classification and a detailed discussion of the
structure, motion and scattering of the recently discovered negaton and positon
solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. There are two distinct types of
negaton solutions which we label $[S^{n}]$ and $[C^{n}]$, where $(n+1)$ is the
order of the Wronskian used in the derivation. For negatons, the number of
singularities and zeros is finite and they show very interesting time
dependence. The general motion is in the positive $x$ direction, except for
certain negatons which exhibit one oscillation around the origin. In contrast,
there is just one type of positon solution, which we label $[\tilde C^n]$. For
positons, one gets a finite number of singularities for $n$ odd, but an
infinite number for even values of $n$. The general motion of positons is in
the negative $x$ direction with periodic oscillations. Negatons and positons
retain their identities in a scattering process and their phase shifts are
discussed. We obtain a simple explanation of all phase shifts by generalizing
the notions of ``mass" and ``center of mass" to singular solutions. Finally, it
is shown that negaton and positon solutions of the KdV equation can be used to
obtain corresponding new solutions of the modified KdV equation.
