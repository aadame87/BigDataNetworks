The Schwinger-Dyson equations of the Makeenko-Migdal type, when supplemented
with some simple equations as consequence of supersymmetry, form a closed set
of equations for Wilson loops and related quantities in the two dimensional
super-gauge theory. We solve these equations. It appears that the planar Wilson
loops are described by the Nambu string without folds. We also discuss how to
put the model on a spatial lattice, where a peculiar gauge is chosen in order
to keep one supersymmetry on the lattice. Supersymmetry is unbroken in this
theory. We comment on possible generalization of these considerations to other
models.
