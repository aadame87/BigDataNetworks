  A constant magnetic field in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions is a strong catalyst of
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, leading to the generation of a fermion mass
even at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions. The essence of
this effect is the dimensional reduction $D/rightarrow D-2$ in the dynamics of
fermion pairing in a magnetic field. The effect is illustrated in the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and QED. Possible applications of this effect and its
extension to inhomogeneous field configurations are discussed.
