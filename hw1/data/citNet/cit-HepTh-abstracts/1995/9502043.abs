Spontaneous breakdown of the continuous symmetry is studied in the framework of
discretized light-front quantization. We consider linear sigma model in 3+1
dimensions and show that the careful treatment of zero modes together with the
regularization of the theory by introducing NG boson mass leads to the correct
description of Nambu-Goldstone phase on the light-front.
