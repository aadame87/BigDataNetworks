  We make a short review of the formalism that describes Higgs and Yang Mills
fields as two particular cases of an appropriate generalization of the notion
of connection. We also comment about the several variants of this formalism,
their interest, the relations with noncommutative geometry, the existence (or
lack of existence) of phenomenological predictions, the relation with Lie
super-algebras etc.
