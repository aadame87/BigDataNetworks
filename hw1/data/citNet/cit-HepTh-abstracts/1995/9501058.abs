We calculate correlation functions in matrix models modified by trace-squared
terms. First we study scaling operators in modified one-matrix models and find
that their correlation functions satisfy modified Virasoro constraints. Then we
turn to dressed order parameters in minimal models and show that their
correlators satisfy Goulian-Li formulae continued to negative Liouville
dressing exponents. Our calculations provide additional support for the idea
that the modified matrix models contain operators with the negative branch of
gravitational dressing.
