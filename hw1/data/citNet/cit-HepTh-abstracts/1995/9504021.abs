  General static solutions for a massless scalar field coupled to a class of
effectively 2-d gravity theories continuously connecting spherically symmetric
$d$-dimensional Einstein gravity ($d >3$) and the CGHS model are analytically
obtained. They include black holes and point scalar charge solutions with naked
singularities, and are used to give an analytic proof of no-hair theorem. Exact
scattering solutions in $s$-wave 4-d Einstein gravity are constructed as a
generalization of corresponding static solutions. They show the existence of
black hole formation threshold for square pulse type incoming stress-energy
flux, above which trapped surfaces are dynamically formed. The relationship
between this behavior and the numerically studied phase transition in this
system \cite{choptuik} is discussed.
