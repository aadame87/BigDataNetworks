We review our recent work on the algebraic characterization of quantum Hall
fluids. Specifically, we explain how the incompressible quantum fluid ground
states can be classified by effective edge field theories with the W-infinity
dynamical symmetry of ``quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms''. Using the
representation theory of W-infinity, we show how all fluids with filling
factors $\nu = m/(pm +1)$ and $\nu = m/(pm-1)$ with $m$ and $p$ positive
integers, $p$ even, correspond exactly to the W-infinity {\it minimal models}.
