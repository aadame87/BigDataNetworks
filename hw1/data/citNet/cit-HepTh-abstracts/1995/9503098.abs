  The conformal spectra of the critical dilute A-D-E lattice models are studied
numerically. The results strongly indicate that, in branches 1 and 2, these
models provide realizations of the complete A-D-E classification of unitary
minimal modular invariant partition functions given by Cappelli, Itzykson and
Zuber. In branches 3 and 4 the results indicate that the modular invariant
partition functions factorize. Similar factorization results are also obtained
for two-colour lattice models.
