  We discuss in detail the parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics of arbitrary
order where the parasupersymmetry is between the normal bosons and those
corresponding to the truncated harmonic oscillator. We show that even though
the parasusy algebra is different from that of the usual parasusy quantum
mechanics, still the consequences of the two are identical. We further show
that the parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics of arbitrary order p can also be
rewritten in terms of p supercharges (i.e. all of which obey $Q_i^{2} = 0$).
However, the Hamiltonian cannot be expressed in a simple form in terms of the p
supercharges except in a special case. A model of conformal parasupersymmetry
is also discussed and it is shown that in this case, the p supercharges, the p
conformal supercharges along with Hamiltonian H, conformal generator K and
dilatation generator D form a closed algebra.
