  The Lee-Weinberg $U(1)$ magnetic monopoles, which have been reinterpreted as
topological solitons of a certain non-Abelian gauged Higgs model recently, are
considered for some specific choice of Higgs couplings. The model under
consideration is shown to admit a Bogomol'nyi-type bound which is saturated by
the configurations satisfying the generalized BPS equations. We consider the
spherically symmetric monopole solutions in some detail.
