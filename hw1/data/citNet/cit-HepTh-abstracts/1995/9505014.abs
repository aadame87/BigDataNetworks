  A superspace formulation for the Batalin Vilkovisky formalism (also called
field-antifield quantization ) with extended BRST invariance (BRST and
anti-BRST invariance ) for gauge theories with closed algebra is presented. In
contrast to a recent formulation, where only BRST invariance holds off shell,
two collective sets of fields are introduced and an off shell realization of
the extended algebra in a superspace with two Grassmann coordinates is
obtained. The example of the Yang Mills theory is also considered.
