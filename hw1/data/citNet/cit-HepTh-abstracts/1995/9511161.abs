  We study some low-lying physical states in a superstring theory based on the
quadratically non-linear $SO(N)$--extended superconformal algebra. In the
realisation of the algebra that we use, all the physical states are discrete,
analogous to the situation in a one-scalar bosonic string. The BRST operator
for the $N=3$ case needs to be treated separately, and its construction is
given here.
