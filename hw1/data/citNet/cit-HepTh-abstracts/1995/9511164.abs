  We study the degenerating limits of superconformal theories for
compactifications on singular K3 and Calabi-Yau threefolds. We find that in
both cases the degeneration involves creating an Euclidean two-dimensional
black hole coupled weakly to the rest of the system. Moreover we find that the
conformal theory of A_n singularities of K3 are the same as that of the
symmetric fivebrane. We also find intriguing connections between ADE (1,n)
non-critical strings and singular limits of superconformal theories on the
corresponding ALE space.
