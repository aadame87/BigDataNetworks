  We discuss in detail the semiclassical approximation for the CGHS model of
two-dimensional dilatonic black holes. This is achieved by a formal expansion
of the full Wheeler-DeWitt equation and the momentum constraint in powers of
the gravitational constant. In highest order, the classical CGHS solution is
recovered. The next order yields a functional Schr\"odinger equation for
quantum fields propagating on this background. We show explicitly how the
Hawking radiation is recovered from this equation. Although described by a pure
quantum state, the expectation value of the number operator exhibits a
Planckian distribution with respect to the Hawking temperature.
 We then show how this Hawking radiation can lead to the decoherence of black
hole superpositions. The cases of a superposition of a black hole with a white
hole, as well as of a black hole with no hole, are treated explicitly.
