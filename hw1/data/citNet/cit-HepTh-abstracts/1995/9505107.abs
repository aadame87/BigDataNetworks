  A general formula for the discrete states (Neveu-Schwarz sector) in $N=1$
$2D$ super-Liouville theory is written down in the world-sheet supersymmetric
form. We then derive a set of gauge states at the discrete momenta. These
discrete gauge states are shown to carry the $w_\infty$ charges and serve as
the symmetry parameters in the old covariant quantization of the theory.
