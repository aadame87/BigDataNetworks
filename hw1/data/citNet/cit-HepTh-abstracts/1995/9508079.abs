  We compute the one-dimensional configuration sums of the ABF model using the
fermionic technique introduced in part I of this paper. Combined with the
results of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester, we find proof of polynomial
identities for finitizations of the Virasoro characters
$\chi_{b,a}^{(r-1,r)}(q)$ as conjectured by Melzer. In the thermodynamic limit
these identities reproduce Rogers--Ramanujan type identities for the unitary
minimal Virasoro characters, conjectured by the Stony Brook group. We also
present a list of additional Virasoro character identities which follow from
our proof of Melzer's identities and application of Bailey's lemma.
