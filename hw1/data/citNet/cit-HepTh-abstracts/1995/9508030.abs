  The topological field theories associated with affine Lie superalgebras are
constructed. Their BRST symmetry is characterised by a Kazama algebra
containing spin 1, 2 and 3 operators and closes linearly. Under this symmetry
all operators are grouped into BRST doublets. The relation between the models
constructed and non-critical string theories is explored.
