Relativistic domain walls are studied in the framework of a polynomial
approximation to the field interpolating between different vacua and forming
the domain wall. In this approach we can calculate evolution of a core and of a
width of the domain wall. In the single, cubic polynomial approximation used in
this paper, the core obeys Nambu-Goto equation for a relativistic membrane. The
width of the domain wall obeys a nonlinear equation which is solved
perturbatively. There are two types of corrections to the constant zeroth order
width: the ones oscillating in time, and the corrections directly related to
curvature of the core. We find that curving a static domain wall is associated
with an increase of its width. As an example, evolution of a toroidal domain
wall is investigated.
