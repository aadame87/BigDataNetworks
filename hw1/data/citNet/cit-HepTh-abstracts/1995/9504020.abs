  A recent result of Gusynin, Miransky and Shovkovy concerning chiral symmetry
breaking by a constant external magnetic field in parity-invariant
three-dimensional QED is generalised to the case of inhomogeneous fields by
relating the phenomenon to the zero modes of the Dirac equation. Virtual photon
radiative corrections and four-dimensional QED are briefly discussed.
