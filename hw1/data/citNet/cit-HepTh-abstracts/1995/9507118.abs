  We use boundary weights and reflection equations to obtain families of
commuting double-row transfer matrices for interaction-round-a-face models with
fixed boundary conditions. In particular, we consider the fusion hierarchy of
the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester models, for which we find that the double-row
transfer matrices satisfy functional equations with an su(2) structure.
