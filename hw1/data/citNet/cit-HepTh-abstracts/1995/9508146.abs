  An alternative approach to perturbative Yang-Mills theories in four (3+1)
dimensional space-time based on the causal Epstein-Glaser method in QFT was
recently proposed. In this short note we show that the set of identities
between C-number distributions expressing nonabelian gauge invariance in the
causal approach imply identities which are analogous to the well-known
Slavnov-Taylor identities. We explicitly derive the Z-factor relations at
one-loop level.
