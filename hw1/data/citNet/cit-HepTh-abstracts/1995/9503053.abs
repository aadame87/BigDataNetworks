Title: OCTONION XY-PRODUCT
Author: Geoffrey Dixon
Comments: 8 pages, Latex
Report-no: BRX TH-372
\\
The octonion X-product changes the octonion multiplication table, but does not
change the role of the identity. The octonion XY-product is very similar, but
shifts the identity as well. This will be of interest to those applying th
octonions to string theory.
