  Amplitudes for boson-boson and fermion-boson interactions are calculated in
the second order of perturbation theory in the Lobachevsky space. An essential
ingredient of the used model is the Weinberg's $2(2j+1)$ component formalism
for describing a particle of spin $j$, recently developed substantially. The
boson-boson amplitude is then compared with the two-fermion amplitude obtained
by Skachkov long ago on the ground of the hamiltonian formulation of quantum
field theory on the mass hyperboloid, $p_0^2 -{\vec p}^{2}=M^2$, proposed by
Kadyshevsky. The parametrization of the amplitudes by means of the momentum
transfer in the Lobachevsky space leads to same spin structures in the
expressions of $T$ matrices for the fermion and the boson cases. However,
certain differences are found. Possible physical applications are discussed.
