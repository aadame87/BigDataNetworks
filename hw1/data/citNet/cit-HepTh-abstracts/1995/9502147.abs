We quantize the three-dimensional $BF$-model using axial gauge conditions.
Exploiting the rich symmetry-structure of the model we show that the
Green-functions correspond to tree graphs and can be obtained as the unique
solution of the Ward-Identities. Furthermore, we will show that the theory can
be uniquely determined by symmetry considerations without the need of an action
principle.
