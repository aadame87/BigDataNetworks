  Using the string field theory recently proposed by the authors and
collaborators, we give a background independent formulation of rational
noncritical string theories with $c\leq 1$. With a little modification of the
string field Hamiltonians previously constructed, we obtain string field
theories which include various rational noncritical string theories as
classical backgrounds.
