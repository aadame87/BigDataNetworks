We compute the $\beta$-function of a YM theory, broken to $U(1)$, by evaluating
the coupling constant renormalization in the broken phase. We perform the
calculation in the unitary gauge where only physical particles appear and the
theory looks like a version of QED containing massive charged spin 1 particles.
We consider an on-shell scattering process and after verifying that the
non-renormalizable divergences which appear in the Green's functions cancel in
the expression of the amplitude, we show that the coupling constant
renormalization is entirely due to the photon self-energy as in QED. However we
get the expected asymptotic freedom and the physical charge decreases
logarithmically as a function of the symmetry breaking scale.
