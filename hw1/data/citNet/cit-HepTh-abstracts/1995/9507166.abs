Title: The Alf'ven Effect and Conformal Field Theory
Authors: M. R. Rahimi Tabar and S. Rouhani
Comments: 7 pages,Latex, no figures. A section on candidate CFT's is added,
  although logarithmic correlators do not appear in the minimal models but
  models which have nearly equal conformal dimensions can mimic logarithmic
  behaviour, provided the Reynold number is large enough, a relationship
  between the reynolds number and conformal dimensions is derived

  Noting that two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics can be modeled by conformal
field theory, we argue that when the Alf'ven effect is also taken into account
one is naturally lead to consider conformal field theories, which have
logarithmic terms in their correlation functions. We discuss the implications
of such logarithmic terms in the context of magnetohydrodynamics, and derive a
relationship between conformal dimensions of the velocity stream function, the
magnetic flux function and the Reynolds number.
