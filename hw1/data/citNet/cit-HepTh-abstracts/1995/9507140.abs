  We present an explicit expression for the topological invariants associated
to $SU(2)$ monopoles in the fundamental representation on spin four-manifolds.
The computation of these invariants is based on the analysis of their
corresponding topological quantum field theory, and it turns out that they can
be expressed in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants. In this analysis we use
recent exact results on the moduli space of vacua of the untwisted $N=1$ and
$N=2$ supersymmetric counterparts of the topological quantum field theory under
consideration, as well as on electric-magnetic duality for $N=2$ supersymmetric
gauge theories.
