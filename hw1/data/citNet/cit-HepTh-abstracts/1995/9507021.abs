  In the present article we solve the Dirac equation in a de Sitter universe
when a constant electric field is present. Using the Bogoliubov
transformations, we compute the rate of spin 1/2 created particles by the
electric field. We compare our results with the scalar case. We also analyze
the behavior of the density of particles created in the limit H=0, when de
Sitter background reduces to a flat space-time.
