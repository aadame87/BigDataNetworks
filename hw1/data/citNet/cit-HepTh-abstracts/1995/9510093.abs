  We report on a search for $N=2$ heterotic strings that are dual candidates of
type II compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds described as $K3$
fibrations. We find many new heterotic duals by using standard orbifold
techniques. The associated type II compactifications fall into chains in which
the proposed duals are heterotic compactifications related one another by a
sequential Higgs mechanism. This breaking in the heterotic side typically
involves the sequence $SU(4)\rightarrow SU(3)\rightarrow $ $SU(2)\rightarrow
0$, while in the type II side the weights of the complex hypersurfaces and the
structure of the $K3$ quotient singularities also follow specific patterns.
