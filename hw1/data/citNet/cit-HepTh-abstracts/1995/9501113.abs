We perform a generalization of the geometrical approach to describing extended
objects for studying the doubly supersymmetric twistor--like formulation of
super--p--branes. Some basic features of embedding world supersurface into
target superspace specified by a geometrodynamical condition are considered. It
is shown that the main attributes of the geometrical approach, such as the
second fundamental form and extrinsic torsion of the embedded surface, and the
Codazzi, Gauss and Ricci equations, have their doubly supersymmetric
counterparts. At the same time the embedding of supersurface into target
superspace has its particular features. For instance, the embedding may cause
more rigid restrictions on the geometrical properties of the supersurface. This
is demonstrated with the examples of an N=1 twistor--like supermembrane in D=11
and type II superstrings in D=10, where the geometrodynamical condition causes
the embedded supersurface to be minimal and puts the theories on the mass
shell.
