  It is well-known that principal chiral models and symmetric space models in
two-dimensional Minkowski space have an infinite-dimensional algebra of hidden
symmetries. Because of the relevance of symmetric space models to duality
symmetries in string theory, the hidden symmetries of these models are explored
in some detail. The string theory application requires including coupling to
gravity, supersymmetrization, and quantum effects. However, as a first step,
this paper only considers classical bosonic theories in flat space-time. Even
though the algebra of hidden symmetries of principal chiral models is confirmed
to include a Kac--Moody algebra (or a current algebra on a circle), it is
argued that a better interpretation is provided by a doubled current algebra on
a semi-circle (or line segment). Neither the circle nor the semi-circle bears
any apparent relationship to the physical space. For symmetric space models the
line segment viewpoint is shown to be essential, and special boundary
conditions need to be imposed at the ends. The algebra of hidden symmetries
also includes Virasoro-like generators. For both principal chiral models and
symmetric space models, the hidden symmetry stress tensor is singular at the
ends of the line segment.
