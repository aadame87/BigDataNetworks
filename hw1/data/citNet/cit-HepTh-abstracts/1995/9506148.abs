  We present evidence for renormalization group fixed points with dual magnetic
descriptions in fourteen new classes of four-dimensional $N=1$ supersymmetric
models. Nine of these classes are chiral and many involve two or three gauge
groups. These theories are generalizations of models presented earlier by
Seiberg, by Kutasov and Schwimmer, and by the present authors. The different
classes are interrelated; one can flow from one class to another using
confinement or symmetry breaking.
