  As an illustration of the formalism of the master field we consider
generalised $QCD_2$. We show how Wilson Loop averages for an arbitrary contour
can be computed explicitly and with some ease. A generalised Hopf equation is
shown to govern the behaviour of the eigenvalue density of Wilson loops. The
collective field description of the theory is therefore deduced. Finally, the
non-trivial master gauge field and field strengths are obtained. These results
do not seem easily accessible with conventional means.
