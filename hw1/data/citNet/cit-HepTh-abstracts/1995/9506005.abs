Authors: J. Fuchs
Comments: 13 pages, latex. Invited talk at the Workshop on Quantum and
  Classical Gauge Theory, Banach Center, Warsaw, May 1995

\\
  The geometric description of Yang-Mills theories and their configuration
space M is reviewed. The presence of singularities in M is explained and some
of their properties are described. The singularity structure is analyzed in
detail for structure group SU(2).
