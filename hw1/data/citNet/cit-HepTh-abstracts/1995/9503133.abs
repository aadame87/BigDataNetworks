  It is shown that there exists such collection of variables that the standard
QCD Lagrangian can be represented as the sum of usual Palatini Lagrangian for
Einstein general relativity and the Lagrangian of matter and some other fields
where the tetrad fields and the metric are constructed from initial $SU(3)$
Yang - Mills fields.
