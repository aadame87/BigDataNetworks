  effects, Erice, Sicily, 13-20 June 1994.

  We discuss dissipative systems in Quantum Field Theory by studying the
canonical quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator (dho). We show that
the set of states of the system splits into unitarily inequivalent
representations of the canonical commutation relations. The irreversibility of
time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily inequivalent
representations. Canonical quantization is shown to lead to time dependent
SU(1,1) coherent states. We derive the exact action for the dho from the path
integral formulation of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger and
by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom for
dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects. Finally, we express
the time evolution generator of the dho in terms of operators of the
$q$-deformation of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra. The $q$-parameter acts as a
label for the unitarily inequivalent representations.
