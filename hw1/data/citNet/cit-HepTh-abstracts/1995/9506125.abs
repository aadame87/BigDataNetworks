  We extend the model of string as a polymer of string bits to the case of
superstring. We mainly concentrate on type II-B superstring, with some
discussion of the obstacles presented by not II-B superstring, together with
possible strategies for surmounting them. As with previous work on bosonic
string we work within the light-cone gauge. The bit model possesses a good deal
less symmetry than the continuous string theory. For one thing, the bit model
is formulated as a Galilei invariant theory in $(D-2)+1$ dimensional
space-time. This means that Poincar\'e invariance is reduced to the Galilei
subgroup in $D-2$ space dimensions. Naturally the supersymmetry present in the
bit model is likewise dramatically reduced. Continuous string can arise in the
bit models with the formation of infinitely long polymers of string bits. Under
the right circumstances (at the critical dimension) these polymers can behave
as string moving in $D$ dimensional space-time enjoying the full $N=2$
Poincar\'e supersymmetric dynamics of type II-B superstring.
