  In a recent paper, Duff and Rahmfeld argued that certain massive $N_R=1/2$
states of the four-dimensional heterotic string correspond to extreme black
hole solutions. We provide further, dynamical, evidence for this identification
by comparing the scattering of these elementary string states with that of the
corresponding extreme black holes, in the limit of low velocities.
