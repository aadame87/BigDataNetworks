Title: Unique Closed-Form Quantization Via Generalized Path Integrals or by
  Natural Extension of the Standard Canonical Recipe
Author: S. K. Kauffmann
Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, Revised to refer to the earlier Kerner-Sutcliffe
  Hamiltonian quantization formula and to the Born-Jordan operator ordering
  rule. Also now gives the generalizations to multiple degrees of freedom and
  continuum fields
\\
  The Feynman-Garrod path integral representation for time evolution is
extended to arbitrary one-parameter continuous canonical transformations. One
thereupon obtains a generalized Kerner-Sutcliffe formula for the unique quantum
representation of the transformation generator, which can be an arbitrary
classical dynamical variable. This closed-form quantization procedure is shown
to be equivalent to a natural extension of the standard canonical quantization
recipe -- an extension that resolves the operator-ordering ambiguity in favor
of the Born-Jordan rule.
