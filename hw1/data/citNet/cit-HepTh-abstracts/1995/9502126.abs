A generating functional $F$ is found for a canonical nonabelian dual
transformation which maps the supersymmetric chiral O(4) $\sigma$-model to an
equivalent supersymmetric extension of the dual $\sigma$-model. This $F$
produces a mapping between the classical phase spaces of the two theories in
which the bosonic (coordinate) fields transform nonlocally, the fermions
undergo a local tangent space chiral rotation, and all currents (fermionic and
bosonic) mix locally. Purely bosonic curvature-free currents of the chiral
model become a {\em symphysis} of purely bosonic and fermion bilinear currents
of the dual theory. The corresponding transformation functional $T$ which
relates wavefunctions in the two quantum theories is argued to be {\em exactly}
given by $T=\exp(iF)$.
