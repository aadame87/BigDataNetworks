  The topological twist of N=2, D=4 matter-coupled supergravities requires a
suitable R-symmetry. This symmetry is realised in the effective supergravities
arising at tree level from certain heterotic compactifications. The set of
instanton equations (topological gauge-fixings) is thus obtained. The
conditions that R-symmetry should satisfy also when these theories are replaced
by their ``exact'' quantum-corrected counterparts are investigated.
