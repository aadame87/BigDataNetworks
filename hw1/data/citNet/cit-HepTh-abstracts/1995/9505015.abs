  Starting from a nonlinear isospinor-spinor field equation, generalized
three-particle Bargmann-Wigner equations are derived. In the strong-coupling
limit, a special class of spin 1/2 bound-states are calculated. These solutions
which are antisymmetric with respect to all indices, have mixed symmetries in
isospin-superspin space and in spin orbit space. As a consequence of this mixed
symmetry, we get three solution manifolds. In appendix \ref{b}, table 2, these
solution manifolds are interpreted as the three generations of leptons and
quarks. This interpretation will be justified in a forthcoming paper.
