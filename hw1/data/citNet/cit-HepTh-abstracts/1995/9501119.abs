Title: Effective quark interactions from QCD
Authors: C. Wetterich
Comments: New numerical results for the effective interactions of heavy quarks
  along with three postscript figures as well a detailed discussion of the
  issue of gauge invariance are included. The paper is shortened (46 pages)

  We propose a new method for an analytical, non-perturbative computation of
effective quark interactions from QCD. It is based on an exact flow equation
which describes the scale dependence of the effective average action for quarks
in presence of gluons.
