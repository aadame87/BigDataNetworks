In this paper, by using an analogy among {\it quantum mechanics}, {\it
electromagnetic beam optics in optical fibers}, and {\it charge particle beam
dynamics}, we introduce the concept of {\it coherent states} for charged
particle beams in the framework of the {\it Thermal Wave Model} (TWM). We give
a physical meaning of the Gaussian-like coherent structures of charged particle
distribution that are both naturally and artificially produced in an
accelerating machine in terms of the concept of coherent states widely used in
quantum mechanics and in quantum optics. According to TWM, this can be done by
using a Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation for a complex function, the so-called
{\it beam wave function} (BWF), whose squared modulus is proportional to the
transverse beam density profile, where Planck's constant and the time are
replaced by the transverse beam emittance and by the propagation coordinate,
respectively. The evolution of the particle beam, whose initial BWF is assumed
to be the simplest coherent state (ground-like state) associated with the beam,
in an infinite 1-D quadrupole-like device with small sextupole and octupole
aberrations, is analytically and numerically investigated.
