  Generically coupled neutral scalar bosons and chiral fermions are shown, in
the eikonal kinematical limit, to be described by a reduced (free field) theory
with N=1 {\it on-shell} supersymmetry. {\it Charged} scalars and spinors turn
out to be described in the eikonal limit by a reduced interacting theory with a
modified and restricted on-shell N=1 supersymmetry. Consequences of such a
symmetry for the nontrivial scattering amplitudes in this latter case are
discussed.
