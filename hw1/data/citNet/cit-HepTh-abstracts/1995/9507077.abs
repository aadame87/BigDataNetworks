  By defining a regular gauge which is conformal-like and provides
instantaneous field propagation, we investigate classical solutions of
(2+1)-Gravity coupled to arbitrarily moving point-like particles. We show how
to separate field equations from self-consistent motion and we provide a
solution for the metric and the motion in the two-body case with arbitrary
speed, up to second order in the mass parameters.
