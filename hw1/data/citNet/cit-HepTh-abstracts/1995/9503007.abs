A formula is proposed for continuing physical correlation functions to
non-integer numbers of dimensions, expressing them as infinite weighted sums
over the same correlation functions in arbitrary integer dimensions. The
formula is motivated by studying the strong coupling expansion, but the end
result makes no reference to any perturbation theory. It is shown that the
formula leads to the correct dimension dependence in weak coupling perturbation
theory at one loop.
