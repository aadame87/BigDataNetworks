  Halpern and Huang recently showed that there are relevant directions in the
space of interactions at the Gaussian fixed point. I show that their result can
be derived from Polchinski's form of the Wilson renormalization group. The
derivation shows that the existence of these directions is independent of the
cutoff function used.
