  We study the renormalization of the Ricci curvature as an example of
generally covariant operators in quantum gravity near two dimensions. We find
that it scales with a definite scaling dimension at short distance. The Ricci
curvature singularity at the big bang can be viewed as such a scaling
phenomenon. The problem of the spacetime singularity may be resolved by the
scale invariance of the spacetime at short distance.
