  The vector-tensor multiplet is coupled off-shell to an N=2 vector multiplet
such that its central charge transformations are realized locally. A gauged
central charge is a necessary prerequisite for a coupling to supergravity and
the strategy underlying our construction uses the potential for such a coupling
as a guiding principle. The results for the action and transformation rules
take a nonlinear form and necessarily include a Chern-Simons term. After a
duality transformation the action is encoded in a homogeneous holomorphic
function consistent with special geometry.
