  The relativistic model with two types of planar fermions interacting with the
Chern-Simons and Maxwell fields is applied to the study of anyon
superconductor. It is demonstrated, that the Meissner effect can be realized in
the case of the simultaneous presence of the fermions with a different magnetic
moment interactions. Under the certain conditions there occures an extra
plateau at the magnetization curve. In the order under consideration the
spectrum of the electromagnetic field excitations contains the long-range
interaction and one massive "photon" state.
