An explicit orbifold example of the non-zero correlation functions related to
the additional contribution to the induced mass term for Higgs particles at low
energies is given. We verify that they form finite dimensional representations
of the target space modular transformation $SL_2(Z)$. This action of the
modular group is shown to be consistent with its action on the fixed points set
defining the twisted fields.
