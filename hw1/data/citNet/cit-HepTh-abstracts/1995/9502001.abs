The ten dimensional heterotic string effective action with graviton, dilaton
and antisymmetric tensor fields is dimensionally reduced to two spacetime
dimensions. The resulting theory, with some constraints on backgrounds, admits
infinite sequence of conserved nonlocal currents. It is shown that generators
of the infinitesimal transformations associated with these currents satisfy
Kac-Moody algebra.
