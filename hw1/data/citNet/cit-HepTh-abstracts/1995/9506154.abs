Title: A metric of Yukawa potential as an exact solution to the field equations
  of general relativity

  It is shown that, by defining a suitable energy momentum tensor, the field
equations of general relativity admit a line element of Yukawa potential as an
exact solution. It is also shown that matter that produces strong force may be
negative, in which case there would be no Schwarzschild-like singularity
