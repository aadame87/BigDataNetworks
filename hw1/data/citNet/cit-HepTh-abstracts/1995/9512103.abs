\\
  Two approaches concerning the connection of the fermionic kappa -- symmetry
with the superstring world -- sheet superdiffeomorphism transformations are
discussed. The first approach is based on the twistor -- like formulation of
the superstring action and the second one on a reformulation of the superstring
and super~-~p~-~brane actions according to the Generalized Action Principle.
