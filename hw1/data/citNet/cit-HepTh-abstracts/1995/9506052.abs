  The Lagrangian for the motion of $n$ well-separated BPS monopoles is
calculated, by treating the monopoles as point particles with magnetic,
electric and scalar charges. It can be reinterpreted as the Lagrangian for
geodesic motion on the asymptotic region of the $n$-monopole moduli space,
thereby determining the asymptotic metric on the moduli space. The metric is
hyperk\"ahler, and is an explicit example of a type of metric considered
previously.
