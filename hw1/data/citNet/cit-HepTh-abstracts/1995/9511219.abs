  Path integral expressions for three canonical formalisms -- Ostrogradski's
one, constrained one and generalized one -- of higher-derivative theories are
given. For each fomalism we consider both nonsingular and singular cases. It is
shown that three formalisms share the same path integral expressions. In
paticular it is pointed out that the generalized canonical formalism is
connected with the constrained one by a canonical transformation.
