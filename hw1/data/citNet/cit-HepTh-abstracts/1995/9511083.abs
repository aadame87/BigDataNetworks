  A few observations concerning topological string theories at the string-tree
level are presented: (1) The tree-level, large phase space solution of an
arbitrary model is expressed in terms of a variational problem, with an
``action'' equal, at the solution, to the one-point function of the puncture
operator, and found by solving equations of Gauss-Manin type; (2) For $A_k$
Landau-Ginzburg models, an extension to large phase space of the usual residue
formula for three-point functions is given.
