Title: Notes on (0,2) Superconformal Field Theories
Author: Jacques Distler

  In these lecture notes, I review the ``linear sigma model" approach to (0,2)
string vacua. My aim is to provide the reader with a toolkit for studying a
very broad class of (0,2) superconformal field theories with the requisite
properties to be candidate string vacua. These lectures were delivered at the
1994 Trieste Summer School.
