Title: New algebraic equation determining anomalies
Author: Haewon Lee
Comments: 9 pages, RevTeX
\\
We derive a new algebraic relation which can be used to find various spinor
loop anomalies. We show that this relation includes the Wess-Zumino consistency
condition. For an example, we consider the chiral anomaly. With this formalism,
the consistent anomaly and the covariant anomaly are determined simultaneously.
