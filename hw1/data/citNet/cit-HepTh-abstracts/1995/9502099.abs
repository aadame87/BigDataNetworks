Static, four-dimensional (4-d) black holes (BH's) in ($4+n$)-d Kaluza-Klein
(KK) theory with Abelian isometry and diagonal internal metric have at most one
electric ($Q$) and one magnetic ($P$) charges, which can either come from the
same $U(1)$-gauge field (corresponding to BH's in effective 5-d KK theory) or
from different ones (corresponding to BH's with $U(1)_M\times U(1)_E$ isometry
of an effective 6-d KK theory). In the latter case, explicit non-extreme
solutions have the global space-time of Schwarzschild BH's, finite temperature,
and non-zero entropy. In the extreme (supersymmetric) limit the singularity
becomes null, the temperature saturates the upper bound
$T_H=1/4\pi\sqrt{|QP|}$, and entropy is zero. A class of KK BH's with
constrained charge configurations, exhibiting a continuous electric-magnetic
duality, are generated by global $SO(n)$ transformations on the above classes
of the solutions.
