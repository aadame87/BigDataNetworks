  We investigate the phase structure and the infrared properties of
higher-derivative quantum gravity (QG) with matter, in $4-\varepsilon$
dimensions. The renormalization group (RG) equations in $4-\varepsilon$
dimensions are analysed for the following types of matter: the
$f\varphi^4$-theory, the $O(N) \varphi^4$-theory, scalar electrodynamics, and
the $SU(2)$ model with scalars. New fixed points for the scalar coupling appear
---one of which is IR stable--- being some of them induced by QG. The IR stable
fixed point perturbed by QG leads to a second-order phase transition for the
theory at non-zero temperature. The RG improved effective potential in the
$SU(2)$ theory (which can be considered as the confining phase of the standard
model) is calculated at nonzero temperature and it is shown that its shape is
clearly influenced by QG.
