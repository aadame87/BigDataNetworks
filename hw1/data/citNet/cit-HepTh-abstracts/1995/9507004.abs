  We study the system of two WZNW models coupled to each other via the
current-current interaction. The system is proven to possess the strong/weak
coupling duality symmetry. The strong coupling phase of this theory is
discussed in detail. It is shown that in this phase the interacting WZNW models
approach non-trivial conformal points along the renormalization group flow. The
relation between the principal chiral model and interacting WZNW models is
investigated.
