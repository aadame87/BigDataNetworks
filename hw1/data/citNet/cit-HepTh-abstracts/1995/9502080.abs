Title: Aharonov-Bohm Order Parameters for Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
Author: Hoi-Kwong Lo (Institute for Advanced Study)
Comments: How quantum fluctuations destroy the coherence between various
  strings are discussed explicitly. That linked Wilson loops are useful order
  parameters for a Maxwell- Chern-Simons-Higgs theory is noted. The generality
  of our results is emphasized. Problems with figures have also been fixed. 43

  The Aharonov-Bohm effect has been invoked to probe the phase structure of a
gauge theory. Yet in the case of non-Abelian gauge theories, it proves
difficult to formulate a general procedure that unambiguously specifies the
realization of the gauge symmetry, e.g. the unbroken subgroup. In this paper,
we propose a set of order parameters that will do the job. We articulate the
fact that any useful Aharonov-Bohm experiment necessarily proceeds in two
stages: calibration and measurement. World sheets of virtual cosmic string
loops can wrap around test charges, thus changing their states relative to
other charges in the universe. Consequently, repeated flux measurements with
test charges will not necessarily agree. This was the main stumbling block to
previous attempts to construct order parameters for non-Abelian gauge theories.
In those works, the particles that one uses for calibration and subsequent
measurement are stored in {\em separate} ``boxes''. By storing all test
particles in the {\em same} ``box'', we show how quantum fluctuations can be
overcome. The importance of gauge fixing is also emphasized.
