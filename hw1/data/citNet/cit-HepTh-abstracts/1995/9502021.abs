In this paper, we pursue our analysis of the W-infinity symmetry of the
low-energy edge excitations of incompressible quantum Hall fluids. These
excitations are described by (1+1)-dimensional effective field theories, which
are built by representations of the W-infinity algebra. Generic W-infinity
theories predict many more fluids than the few, stable ones found in
experiments. Here we identify a particular class of W-infinity theories, the
minimal models, which are made of degenerate representations only - a familiar
construction in conformal field theory. The W-infinity minimal models exist for
specific values of the fractional conductivity, which nicely fit the
experimental data and match the results of the Jain hierarchy of quantum Hall
fluids. We thus obtain a new hierarchical construction, which is based uniquely
on the concept of quantum incompressible fluid and is independent of Jain's
approach and hypotheses. Furthermore, a surprising non-Abelian structure is
found in the W-infinity minimal models: they possess neutral quark-like
excitations with SU(m) quantum numbers and non-Abelian fractional statistics.
The physical electron is made of anyon and quark excitations. We discuss some
properties of these neutral excitations which could be seen in experiments and
numerical simulations.
