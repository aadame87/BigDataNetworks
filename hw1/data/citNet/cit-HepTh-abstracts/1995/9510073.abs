Title: Supergravity, Linear Multiplets, and Chern-Simons Forms
Authors: R. Grimm
\\
  Some general features of locally supersymmetric theories (N=1 in four
dimensions) involving Chern-Simons forms and antisymmetric tensors are sketched
out. The relevance of the three-form multiplet both for the description of
Chern-Simons forms and the supersymmetry properties of the gaugino condensate
is pointed out.
