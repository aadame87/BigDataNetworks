  We quantize the Chern-Simons-Proca theory in three dimensions by using the
Batalin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method, which systematically embeds second class
constraint system into first class by introducing new fields in the extended
phase space. As results, we obtain simultaneously the St\"uckelberg scalar
term, which is needed to cancel the gauge anomaly due to the mass term, and the
new type of Wess-Zumino action, which is irrelevant to the gauge symmetry. We
also investigate the infrared property of the Chern-Simons-Proca theory by
using the Batalin-Tyutin formalism comparing with the symplectic formalism. As
a result, we observe that the resulting theory is precisely the gauge invariant
Chern-Simons-Proca quantum mechanical version of this theory.
