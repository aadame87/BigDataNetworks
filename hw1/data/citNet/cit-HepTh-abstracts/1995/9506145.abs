  A supercurrent superfield whose components include a conserved
energy-momentum tensor and supersymmetry current as well as a (generally
broken) R-symmetry current is constructed for a generic effective N=1
supersymmetric gauge theory. The general form of the R-symmetry breaking is
isolated. Included within the various special cases considered is the
identification of those models which exhibit an unbroken R-symmetry. One such
example corresponds to a non-linearly realized gauge symmetry where the chiral
field R-weight is required to vanish.
