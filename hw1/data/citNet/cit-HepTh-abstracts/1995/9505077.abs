  Higher order coefficients of the inverse mass expansion of one--loop
effective actions are obtained from a one--dimensional path integral
representation. For the evaluation of the path integral with Wick contractions
a suitable Green function has to be chosen. We consider the case of a massive
scalar loop in the background of both a scalar potential and a (non--abelian)
gauge field. For the pure scalar case the method yields the coefficients of the
expansion in a minimal set of basis terms whereas complicated ordering problems
arise in gauge theory. An appropriate reduction scheme is discussed.
