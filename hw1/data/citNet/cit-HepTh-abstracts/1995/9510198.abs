  We study the partition function of N=1 supersymmetric De Rham quantum
mechanics on a Riemannian manifold, with a nontrivial chemical potential $\mu$
for the fermions. General arguments suggest that when $\mu \to \infty$ we
should get the partition function of a free point particle. We investigate this
limit by exact evaluation of the fermionic path integral. In even dimensions we
find the De Witt term with a definite numerical factor. However, in odd
dimensions our result is pestered by a quantum mechanical anomaly and the
numerical factor in the De Witt term remains ambiquous.
