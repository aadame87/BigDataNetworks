  The quasi-particle structure of the higher spin XXZ model is studied. We
obtained a new description of crystals associated with the level $k$ integrable
highest weight $U_q(\widehat{sl_2})$ modules in terms of the creation operators
at $q=0$ (the crystaline spinon basis). The fermionic character formulas and
the Yangian structure of those integrable modules naturally follow from this
description. We have also derived the conjectural formulas for the multi
quasi-particle states at $q=0$.
