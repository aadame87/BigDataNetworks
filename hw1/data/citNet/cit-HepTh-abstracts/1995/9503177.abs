Title: Higher Derivatives and Canonical Formalism
Author: Shinji HAMAMOTO (Toyama Univ.)
Comments: 7 pages, LaTex.
\\
  A canonical formalism for higher-derivative theories is presented on the
basis of Dirac's method for constrained systems. It is shown that this
formalism shares a path integral expression with Ostrogradski's canonical
formalism.
