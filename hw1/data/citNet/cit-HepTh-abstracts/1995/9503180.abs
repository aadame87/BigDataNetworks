  In this letter we show how the action functional of the standard model and of
gravity can be derived from a specific Dirac operator. Far from being exotic
this particular Dirac operator turns out to be structurally determined by the
Yukawa coupling term. The main feature of our approach is that it naturally
unifies the action of the standard model with gravity.
