  A variety of unitary gauges for perturbation theory in a background field is
considered in order to find those most suitable for a Hamiltonian treatment of
the system. We select two convenient gauges and derive the propagators
$D_{\mu\nu}$ for gluonic quantum fluctuations immersed in background
configurations. The first one is a unitary generalization of the usual Coulomb
gauge in QED which preserves the decoupling of two propagating polarizations
from the instantaneous one. The second possibility is the axial light cone
gauge which remains ghost free also in the presence of a background.
Applications of the formalism to the spectrum and dynamics of QCD at the
confinement scale, such as hybrid states, are briefly discussed.
