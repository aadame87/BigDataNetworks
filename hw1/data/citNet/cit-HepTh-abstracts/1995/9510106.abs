  Two-dimensional sigma models are defined for the new manifestly spacetime
supersymmetric description of four-dimensional compactified superstrings. The
resulting target-superspace effective action is constrained by the way the
spacetime dilaton couples to the worldsheet curvature: For the heterotic
superstring, the worldsheet curvature couples to the real part of a chiral
multiplet, and for Type II it couples to the real part of the sum of a vector
multiplet and a tensor hypermultiplet.
   For the Type II superstring, this contradicts the standard folklore that
only a hypermultiplet counts string-loops, explains the peculiar dilaton
coupling of Ramond-Ramond fields, and allows the effective action to be easily
written in N=2 $4D$ superspace. It also implies that vector multiplet
interactions get no quantum corrections, while hypermultiplet interactions can
only get corrections if mirror symmetry is non-perturbatively broken.
