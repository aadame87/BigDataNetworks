  We review some of the recent work on the dynamics of four dimensional,
supersymmetric gauge theories. The kinematics are largely determined by
holomorphy and the dynamics are governed by duality. The results shed light on
the phases of gauge theories. Some results and interpretations which have not
been published before are also included.
