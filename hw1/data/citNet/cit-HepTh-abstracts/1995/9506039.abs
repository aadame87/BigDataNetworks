  WZNW models, especially gauged WZNW models, are important in the study of
conformal field theories. Karabali and Schnitzer initiated the study of the
BRST cohomology of a WZNW model gauged by an anomaly free vector sub-group and
results were given for abelian sub-groups. This result was generalized to
non-abelian sub-groups for a specific set of representations \cite{HR1}. The
subject of this talk is the analysis of arbitrary representations
\cite{HR2,Hw}.
