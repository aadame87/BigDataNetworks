  We study a functional field theory of membranes coupled to a rank--three
tensor gauge potential. We show that gauge field radiative corrections lead to
membrane condensation which turns the gauge field into a {\it massive spin--0
field}. This is the Coleman--Weinberg mechanism for {\it membranes}. An analogy
is also drawn with a type--II superconductor. The ground state of the system
consists of a two--phase medium in which the superconducting background
condensate is ``pierced'' by four dimensional domains, or ``bags'', of non
superconducting vacuum. Bags are bounded by membranes whose physical thickness
is of the order of the inverse mass acquired by the gauge field.
