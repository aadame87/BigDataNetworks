Title: Exchange statistics in 1D: from the viewpoint of exact solution
Author: Ilinski, G.V.Kalinin, V.S.Kapitonov
Comments: A few formulae are corrected. A new formula for the generation
  function is added
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Algebra

  We show that the exchange statistics have consequences in 1D systems with
compact topology, contrary to the common opinion that exchange statistics is
arbitrary in 1D. As examples of non-trivial statistical behavior we exactly
calculate the partition function and correlators for systems of free
q-particles on compactified chains using functional integral techniques and the
supersymmetric trick. In particular we consider a spin 1/2 XY-chain with
periodic boundary conditions that corresponds to the case of q=-1.
