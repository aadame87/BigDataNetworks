  The operator solution of the anomalous chiral Schwinger model is discussed on
the basis of the general principles of Wightman field theory. Some basic
structural properties of the model are analyzed taking a careful control on the
Hilbert space associated with the Wightman functions. The isomorphism between
gauge noninvariant and gauge invariant descriptions of the anomalous theory is
established in terms of the corresponding field algebras. We show that (i) the
Theta-vacuum representation and (ii) the suggested equivalence of vector
Schwinger model and chiral Schwinger model cannot be established in terms of
the intrinsic field algebra.
