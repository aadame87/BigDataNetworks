  We investigate the tachyon-dilaton-metric system to study the "graceful exit"
problem in string theoretic inflation, where tachyon plays the role of the
scalar field. From the phase space analysis, we find that the inflationary
phase does not smoothly connect to a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) expanding
universe, thereby providing a simple tachyonic extension of the recently proved
stringy no-go theorem.
