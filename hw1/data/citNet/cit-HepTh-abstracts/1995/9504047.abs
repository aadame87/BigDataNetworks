  It is shown that the Type IIA superstring compactified on $K3$ has a smooth
string soliton with the same zero mode structure as the heterotic string
compactified on a four torus, thus providing new evidence for a conjectured
exact duality between the two six-dimensional string theories. The chiral
worldsheet bosons arise as zero modes of Ramond-Ramond fields of the IIA string
theory and live on a signature $(20,4)$ even, self-dual lattice. Stable, finite
loops of soliton string provide the charged Ramond-Ramond states necessary for
enhanced gauge symmetries at degeneration points of the $K3$ surface. It is
also shown that Type IIB strings toroidally compactified to six dimensions have
a multiplet of string solutions with Type II worldsheets.
