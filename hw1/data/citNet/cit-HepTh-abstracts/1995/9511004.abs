  We address the problem of finite-size anyons, i.e., composites of charges and
finite radius magnetic flux tubes. Making perturbative calculations in this
problem meets certain difficulties reminiscent of those in the problem of
pointlike anyons. We show how to circumvent these difficulties for anyons of
arbitrary spin. The case of spin 1/2 is special because it allows for a direct
application of perturbation theory, while for any other spin, a redefinition of
the wave function is necessary. We apply the perturbative algorithm to the
N-body problem, derive the first-order equation of state and discuss some
examples.
