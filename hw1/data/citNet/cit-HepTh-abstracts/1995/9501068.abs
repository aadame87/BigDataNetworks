It is argued that the type IIA 10-dimensional superstring theory is actually a
compactified 11-dimensional supermembrane theory in which the fundamental
supermembrane is identified with the the solitonic membrane of 11-dimensional
supergravity. The charged extreme black holes of the 10-dimensional type IIA
string theory are interpreted as the Kaluza-Klein modes of 11-dimensional
supergravity and the dual sixbranes as the analogue of Kaluza-Klein monopoles.
All other p-brane solutions of the type IIA superstring theory are derived from
the 11-dimensional membrane and its magnetic dual fivebrane soliton.
