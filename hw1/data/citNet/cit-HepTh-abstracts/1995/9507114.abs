  Using a formulation of QCD_2 as a perturbed conformally invariant theory
involving fermions, ghosts, as well as positive and negative level
Wess-Zumino-Witten fields, we show that the BRST conditions become restrictions
on the conformally invariant sector, as described by a G/G topological theory.
By solving the corresponding cohomology problem we are led to a finite set of
vacua. For G=SU(2) these vacua are two-fold degenerate.
