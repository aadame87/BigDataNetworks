  We propose an extension of 't Hooft's large-$N_c$ light-front QCD in two
dimensions to include helicity and physical gluon degrees of freedom, modelled
on a classical dimensional reduction of four dimensional QCD. A
non-perturbative renormalisation of the infinite set of coupled integral
equations describing boundstates is performed. These equations are then solved,
both analytically in a phase space wavefunction approximation and numerically
by discretising momenta, for (hybrid) meson masses and (polarized) parton
structure functions.
