  We elaborate on our previous work on N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In
particular, we show how to explicitly determine the low energy quantum
effective action for $G=SU(3)$ from the underlying hyperelliptic Riemann
surface, and calculate the leading instanton corrections. This is done by
solving Picard-Fuchs equations and asymptotically evaluating period integrals.
We find that the dynamics of the $SU(3)$ theory is governed by an Appell system
of type $F_4$, and compute the exact quantum gauge coupling explicitly in terms
of Appell functions.
