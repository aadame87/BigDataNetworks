  Different methods of calculation of quantum corrections to the
thermodynamical characteristics of a black hole are discussed and compared. The
relation between on-shell and off-shell approaches is established. The
off-shell methods are used to explicitly demonstrate that the thermodynamical
entropy $S^{TD}$ of a black hole, defined by the first thermodynamical law,
differs from the statistical-mechanical entropy $S^{SM}$, determined as
$S^{SM}=-\mbox{Tr}(\hat{\rho}^H\ln\hat{\rho}^H)$ for the density matrix
$\hat{\rho}^H$ of a black hole. It is shown that the observable thermodynamical
black hole entropy can be presented in the form $S^{TD}=\pi {\bar
r}_+^2+S^{SM}-S^{SM}_{Rindler}$. Here ${\bar r}_+$ is the radius of the horizon
shifted because of the quantum backreaction effect, and $S^{SM}_{Rindler}$ is
the statistical-mechanical entropy calculated in the Rindler space.
