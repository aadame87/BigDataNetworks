  From the time-independent current $\tcj(\bar y,\bar k)$ in the quantum
self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory, we construct new group-valued quantum
fields $\tilde U(\bar y,\bar k)$ and $\bar U^{-1}(\bar y,\bar k)$ which satisfy
a set of exchange algebras such that fields of $\tcj(\bar y,\bar k)\sim\tilde
U(\bar y,\bar k)~\partial\bar y~\tilde U^{-1}(\bar y,\bar k)$ satisfy the
original time-independent current algebras. For the correlation functions of
the products of the $\tilde U(\bar y,\bar k)$ and $\tilde U^{-1}(\bar y,\bar
k)$ fields defined in the invariant state constructed through the current
$\tcj(\bar y,\bar k)$ we can derive the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (K-Z) equations
with an additional spatial dependence on $\bar k$. From the $\tilde U(\bar
y,\bar k)$ and $\tilde U^{-1}(\bar y,\bar k)$ fields we construct the
quantum-group generators --- local, global, and semi-local --- and their
algebraic relations. For the correlation functions of the products of the
$\tilde U$ and $\tilde U^{-1}$ fields defined in the invariant state
constructed through the semi-local quantum-group generators we obtain the
quantum-group difference equations. We give the explicit solution to the two
point function.
