  We consider the problem of constructing a non-singular inflationary universe
in stringy gravity via branch changing, from a previously superexponentially
expanding phase to an FRW-like phase. Our approach is based on the phase space
analysis of the dynamics, and we obtain a no-go theorem which rules out the
efficient scenario of branch changing catalyzed by dilaton potential and
stringy fluid sources. We furthermore consider the effects of string-loop
corrections to the gravitational action in the form recently suggested by
Damour and Polyakov. These corrections also fail to produce the desired branch
change. However, focusing on the possibility that these corrections may
decouple the dilaton, we deduce that they may lead to an inflationary expansion
in the presence of a cosmological constant, which asymptotically approaches
Einstein-deSitter solution.
