\\
  A large class of string-cosmology backgrounds leads to a spectrum of relic
stochastic gravitational waves, strongly tilted towards high frequencies, and
characterized by two basic parameters of the cosmological model. We estimate
the required sensitivity for detection of the predicted gravitational radiation
and show that a region of our parameter space is within reach for some of the
planned gravitational-wave detectors.
