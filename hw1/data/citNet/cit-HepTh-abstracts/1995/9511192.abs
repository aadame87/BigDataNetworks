  We study the formation of vacuum condensates in $2+1$ dimensional QED in the
presence of inhomogeneous background magnetic fields. For a large class of
magnetic fields, the condensate is shown to be proportional to the
inhomogeneous magnetic field, in the large flux limit. This may be viewed as a
{\it local} form of the {\it integrated} degeneracy-flux relation of Aharonov
and Casher.
