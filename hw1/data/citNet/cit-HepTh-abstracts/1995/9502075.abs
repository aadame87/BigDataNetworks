  The standard formulation of a massive Abelian vector field in $2+1$
dimensions involves a Maxwell kinetic term plus a Chern-Simons mass term; in
its place we consider a Chern-Simons kinetic term plus a Stuekelberg mass term.
In this latter model, we still have a massive vector field, but now the
interaction with a charged spinor field is renormalizable (as opposed to super
renormalizable). By choosing an appropriate gauge fixing term, the Stuekelberg
auxiliary scalar field decouples from the vector field. The one-loop spinor
self energy is computed using operator regularization, a technique which
respects the three dimensional character of the antisymmetric tensor
$\epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$. This method is used to evaluate the vector self
energy to two-loop order; it is found to vanish showing that the beta function
is zero to two-loop order. The canonical structure of the model is examined
using the Dirac constraint formalism.
