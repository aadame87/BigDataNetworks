  We look for a graviton-dilaton theory which can predict non trivial values of
the PPN parameters $\beta$ and/or $\gamma$ for a charge neutral point star,
without any naked singularity. With the potential for dilaton $\phi$ set to
zero, it contains one arbitrary function $\psi(\phi)$. Our requirements impose
certain constraints on $\psi$, which lead to the following generic and model
independent novel results: For a charge neutral point star, the gravitational
force becomes repulsive at distances of the order of, but greater than, the
Schwarzschild radius $r_0$. There is also no horizon for $r > r_0$. These
results suggest that black holes are unlikely to form in a stellar collapse in
this theory.
