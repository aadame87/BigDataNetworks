  The form factor bootstrap approach is used to compute the exact contributions
in the large distance expansion of the correlation function $<\sigma(x)
\sigma(0)>$ of the two-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field at $T=T_c$.
The matrix elements of the magnetization operator $\sigma(x)$ present a rich
analytic structure induced by the (multi) scattering processes of the eight
massive particles of the model. The spectral representation series has a fast
rate of convergence and perfectly agrees with the numerical determination of
the correlation function.
