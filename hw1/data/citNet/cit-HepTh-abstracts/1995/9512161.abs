  Some basic facts about the prepotential in the SW/Whitham theory are
presented. Consideration begins from the abstract theory of quasiclassical
$\tau$-functions , which uses as input a family of complex spectral curves with
a meromorphic differential $dS$, subject to the constraint $\partial
dS/\partial(moduli)= \ holomorphic$, and gives as an output a homogeneous
prepotential on extended moduli space. Then reversed construction is discussed,
which is straightforwardly generalizable from spectral {\it curves} to certain
complex manifolds of dimension $d >1$ (like $K3$ and $CY$ families). Finally,
examples of particular $N=2$ SUSY gauge models are considered from the point of
view of this formalism. At the end we discuss similarity between the
$WP^{12}_{1,1,2,2,6}$ -\-Calabi-\-Yau model with $h_{21}=2$ and the $1d$
$SL(2)$ Calogero/Ruijsenaars model, but stop short of the claim that they
belong to the same Whitham universality class beyond the conifold limit.
