  We obtain an explicit expression for the supersymmetric Wilson loop in terms
of chiral superfields and supercurrents in superspace. The result turns out to
be different from what one would expect from the simple replacement of Lie
algebra valued connection in the exponent with the corresponding super-Lie
algebraic one. Genralizing the super particle coupling represented by the
supersymmetric Wilson loop, we show that there exists a unique dimensionless
coupling of the superstring to abelian supersymmetric gauge theories that
respects all the known symmetries. The coupling is expressed in terms of chiral
currents in superspace. The natural superstring coupling gives rise to a new
observable that is "stringy" in nature and has no analogue in
non-supersymmetric gauge theories.
