  We show that self-dual Nielsen Olesen (NO) vortices in $3$ dimensions give
rise to a class of exact solutions when coupled to Einstein Maxwell Dilaton
gravity obeying the Majumdar-Papapetrou(MP) relation between gravitational and
Maxwell couplings , provided certain Chern-Simons type interactions are
present. The metric may be solved for explicitly in terms of the NO vortex
function and becomes degenerate at scales $r_H \sim l_S exp(\frac{l_S}{l_P})$
where $l_S$ is the vortex core size and $l_P$ the Planck length. For typical
$l_S\geq 10^4 l_P$ the horizon is thus pushed out to exponentially large
scales. In the intermediate asymptotic region (IAR) $l_S<<r<<r_H$ there is a
logarithmic deviation of the metric from the flat metric and of the electric
field from that of a point charge (which makes it decrease {\it{slower}} than
$r^{-1}$ :hence the prefix hyper). In the IAR the ADM energy and charge
integrals increase logarithmically with the distance from the core region and
finally diverge at the signature change horizon. String solutions in $4+p$
dimensions are obtained by replacing the Maxwell fiel0d by an antisymmetric
tensor field (of rank $2+p$) and have essentially similar properties with $r_H
\sim l_S exp((\frac{l_S}{l_P})^{2+p})$ and with the antisymmetric charge
playing the role of the topological electric charge .
