  We present a supersymmetric non-linear $\s$-model built up in the $N=1$
superspace of Atiyah-Ward space-time. A manifold of the K\"ahler type comes out
that is restricted by a particular decomposition of the K\"ahler potential. The
gauging of the $\s$-model isometries is also accomplished in superspace.
