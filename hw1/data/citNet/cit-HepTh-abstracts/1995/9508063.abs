  The link between the treatment of singular lagrangians as field systems and
the general approch is studied. It is shown that singular Lagrangians as field
systems are always in exact agreement with the general approch.
  Two examples and the singular Lagrangian with zero rank Hessian matrix are
studied. The equations of motion in the field systems are equivalent to the
equations which contain accleration, and the constraints are equivalent to the
equations which do not contain acceleration in the general approch treatment.
