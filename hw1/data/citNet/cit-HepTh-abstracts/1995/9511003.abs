  Lavelle-McMullan symmetry of QED is examined at classical and quantum levels.
It is shown that Lavelle-McMullan symmetry does not give any new non-trivial
information in QED by examining the Ward-Takahashi identities. Being inspired
by the examination of Ward-Takahashi identity, we construct the generalized
non-local and non-covariant symmetries of QED.
