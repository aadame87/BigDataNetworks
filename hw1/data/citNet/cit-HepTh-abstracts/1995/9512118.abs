  We consider an electron which is electromagnetically dressed in such a way
that it is both gauge invariant and that it has the associated electric and
magnetic fields expected of a moving charge. We study the propagator of this
dressed electron and, for small velocities, show explicitly at one loop that at
the natural (on-shell) renormalisation point, $p_0=m$, ${\bold p}= m{\bold v}$,
one can renormalise the propagator multiplicatively. Furthermore the
renormalisation constants are infra-red finite. This shows that the dressing we
use corresponds to a slowly moving, physical asymptotic field.
