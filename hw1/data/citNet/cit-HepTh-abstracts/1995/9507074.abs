  A lattice-type regularization of the supersymmetric field theories on a
supersphere is constructed by approximating the ring of scalar superfields by
an integer-valued sequence of finite dimensional rings of supermatrices and by
using the differencial calculus of non-commutative geometry. The regulated
theory involves only finite number of degrees of freedom and is manifestly
supersymmetric.
