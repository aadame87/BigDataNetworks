  We analyze the initial value problem for spinor fields obeying the Dirac
equation, with particular attention to the characteristic surfaces. The
standard Cauchy initial value problem for first order differential equations is
to construct a solution function in a neighborhood of space and time from the
values of the function on a selected initial value surface. On the
characteristic surfaces the solution function may be discontinuous, so the
standard Cauchy construction breaks down. For the Dirac equation the
characteristic surfaces are null surfaces. An alternative version of the
initial value problem may be formulated using null surfaces; the initial value
data needed differs from that of the standard Cauchy problem, and in the case
we here discuss the values of separate components of the spinor function on an
intersecting pair of null surfaces comprise the necessary initial value data.
We present an expression for the construction of a solution from null surface
data; two analogues of the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian operator determine
the evolution of the system.
