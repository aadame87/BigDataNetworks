  A consistent method for calculating the interquark potential generated by the
relativistic string with massive ends is proposed. In this approach the
interquark potential in the model of the Nambu--Goto string with point--like
masses at its ends is calculated. At first the calculation is done in the
one--loop approximation and then the variational estimation is performed. The
quark mass correction results in decreasing the critical distance
(deconfinement radius). When quark mass decreases the critical distance also
decreases. For obtaining a finite result under summation over eigenfrequencies
of the Nambu--Goto string with massive ends a suitable mode--by--mode
subtraction is proposed. This renormalization procedure proves to be completely
unique. In the framework of the developed approach the one--loop interquark
potential in the model of the relativistic string with rigidity is also
calculated.
