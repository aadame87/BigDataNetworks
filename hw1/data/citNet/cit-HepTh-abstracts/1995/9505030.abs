  Taking advantage of the representation of dilatonic gravity with the 
$R^2$-term under the form of low-derivative dilatonic gravity coupled to an 
additional scalar, we construct a general renormalizable model motivated by 
this theory. Exact black hole solutions are found for some special versions 
of the model, and their thermodynamical properties are described in detail. 
In particular, their horizons and temperatures are calculated. Finally, the
corresponding one-loop effective action is obtained in the conformal gauge, and
a number of its properties -including the construction of one-loop finite
models-are briefly described.
