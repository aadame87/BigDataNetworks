  The $N=4$ supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills theory in a four- dimensional
space with signature $(2,2)$ is formulated in harmonic superspace. The on-shell
constraints of the theory are reformulated in the equivalent form of vanishing
curvature conditions for three gauge connections (one harmonic and two
space-time). The constraints are then obtained as variational equations from a
superspace action of the Chern-Simons type. The action is manifestly $SO(2,2)$
invariant. It can be viewed as the Lorentz-covariant form of the light-cone
superfield action proposed by Siegel.
