We reduce the dual version of $D=10$, $N=1$ supergravity coupled to $n$ vector
fields to four dimensions, and derive the $SL(2,R)\times O(6,6+n)$
transformations which leave the equations of motion invariant. For $n=0$
$SL(2,R)$ is also a symmetry of the action, but for $n>0$ only those $SL(2,R)$
transformations which act linearly on all fields leave the action invariant.
The resulting four-dimensional theory is related to the bosonic part of the
usual formulation of $N=4$ supergravity coupled to matter by a duality
transformation.
