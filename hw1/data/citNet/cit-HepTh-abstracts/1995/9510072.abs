  We review the new approach to the theory of nonlinear $W$-algebras which is
developed recently and called {\it conformal linearization}. In this approach
$W$-algebras are embedded as subalgebras into some {\it linear conformal}
algebras with a finite set of currents and most of their properties could be
understood in a much simpler way by studing their linear counterpart. The
general construction is illustrated by the examples of $u(N)$-superconformal,
$W(sl(N),sl(2))$, $W(sl(N),sl(N))$ as well as $W(sl(N),sl(3))$ algebras.
Applications to the construction of realizations (included modulo null fields
realizations) as well as central charge spectrum for minimal models of
nonlinear algebras are discussed. (To appear in ``Geometry and Integrable
