We discuss a two-dimensional lagrangian model with $N=2$ supersymmetry
described by a K\"{a}hler potential $K(X,\bar{X})$ and superpotential $gX^k$
which explicitly exhibits renormalization group flows to infrared fixed points
where the central charge has a value equal that of the $N=2$, $A_{k-1}$ minimal
model. We consider the dressing of such models by N=2 supergravity: in
contradistinction to bosonic or $N=1$ models, no modification of the
$\b$-function takes place.
