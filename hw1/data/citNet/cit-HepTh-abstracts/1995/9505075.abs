  We construct families of hyper-elliptic curves which describe the quantum
moduli spaces of vacua of $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories coupled
to $N_f$ flavors of quarks in the fundamental representation. The quantum
moduli spaces for $N_f < N_c$ are determined completely by imposing
$R$-symmetry, instanton corrections and the proper classical singularity
structure. These curves are verified by residue and weak coupling monodromy
calculations. The quantum moduli spaces for $N_f\geq N_c$ theories are
parameterized and their general structure is worked out using residue
calculations. Global symmetry considerations suggest a complete description of
them. The results are supported by weak coupling monodromy calculations. The
exact metrics on the quantum moduli spaces as well as the exact spectrum of
stable massive states are derived. We find an example of a novel symmetry of a
quantum moduli space: Invariance under the exchange of a moduli parameter and
the bare mass. We apply our method for the construction of the quantum moduli
spaces of vacua of $N=1$ supersymmetric theories in the coulomb phase.
