  We propose a new method for the study of the chiral properties of the ground
state in QFT's based on the computation of the probability distribution
function of the chiral condensate. It can be applied directly in the chiral
limit and therefore no mass extrapolations are needed. Furthermore this
approach allows to write up equations relating the chiral condensate with
quantities computable by standard numerical methods, the functional form of
these relations depending on the broken symmetry group. As a check, we report
some results for the compact Schwinger model.
