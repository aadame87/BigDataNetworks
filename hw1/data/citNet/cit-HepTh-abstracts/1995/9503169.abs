  A procedure of bosonization of Fermions in an arbitrary dimension is
suggested. It is shown that a quadratic expression in the fermionic fields
after rescaling time $t\to t/\lambda^2$ and performing the limit $\lambda\to0$
(stochastic limit), gives rise to a bosonic operator satisfying the boson
canonical commutation relations. This stochastic bosonization of Fermions is
considered first for free fields and then for a model with three--linear
couplings. The limiting dynamics of the bosonic theory turns out to be
described by means of a quantum stochastic differential equations.
