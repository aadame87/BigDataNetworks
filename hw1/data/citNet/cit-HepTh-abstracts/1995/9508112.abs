  We analyze the collective motion of micro-organisms in the fluid and consider
the problem of the red tide. The red tide is produced by the condensation of
the micro-organisms, which might be a similar phenomenon to the condensation of
the strings. We propose a model of the generation of the red tide. By
considering the interaction between the micro- organisms mediated by the
velocity fields in the fluid, we derive the Van der Waals type equation of
state, where the generation of the red tide can be regarded as a phase
transition from the gas of micro-organisms to the liquid. (The number density
of micro-organisms which generates the red tide is order estimated.)
