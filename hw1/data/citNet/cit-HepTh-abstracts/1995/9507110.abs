Title: Calogero-Sutherland model from excitations of Chern-Simons vortices
Authors: I. Andri\'c, V. Bardek and L. Jonke (Rudjer Boskovic Inst., Croatia)
Comments: revtex, 11 pages. The delta interaction included, as required by
  latest results on renormalization of the Chern-Simons theory. This does not
  change the conclusion of the paper

  We consider a large-N Chern-Simons theory for the attractive bosonic matter
(Jackiw-Pi model) in the Hamiltonian, collective-field approach based on the
1/N expansion. We show that the dynamics of density excitations around the
ground-state semiclassical configuration is governed by the Calogero or by the
Sutherland Hamiltonian, depending on the symmetry of the underlying
static-soliton configuration. The relationship between the Chern-Simons
coupling constant $\l$ and the Calogero-Sutherland statistical parameter $\l_c$
signalizes some sort of statistical transmutation accompanying the dimensional
reduction of the initial problem.
