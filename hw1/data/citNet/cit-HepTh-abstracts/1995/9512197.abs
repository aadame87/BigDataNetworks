  The order dependent mapping method, its convergence has recently been proven
for the energy eigenvalue of the anharmonic oscillator, is applied to re-sum
the standard perturbation series for Stark effect of the hydrogen atom. We
perform a numerical experiment up to the fiftieth order of the perturbation
expansion. A simple mapping suggested by the analytic structure and the strong
field behavior gives an excellent agreement with the exact value for an
intermediate range of the electric field, $0.03\leq E\leq0.25$. The imaginary
part of the energy (the decay width) as well as the real part of the energy is
reproduced from the standard perturbation series.
