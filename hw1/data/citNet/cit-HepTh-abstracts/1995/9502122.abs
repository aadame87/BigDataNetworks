  The standard notion of the non-Abelian duality in string theory is
generalized to the class of $\si$-models admitting `non-commutative conserved
charges'. Such $\si$-models can be associated with every Lie bialgebra $(\cg
,\cgt)$ and they possess an isometry group iff the commutant
  $[\cgt,\cgt]$ is not equal to $\cgt$. Within the enlarged class of the
backgrounds the non-Abelian duality {\it is} a duality transformation in the
proper sense of the word. It exchanges the roles of $\cg$ and $\cgt$ and it can
be interpreted as a symplectomorphism of the phase spaces of the mutually dual
theories. We give explicit formulas for the non-Abelian duality transformation
for any $(\cg,\cgt)$. The non-Abelian analogue of the Abelian modular space
$O(d,d;{\bf Z})$ consists of all maximally isotropic decompositions of the
corresponding Drinfeld double.
