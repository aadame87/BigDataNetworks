  In presence of string solitons, index theorems for the generalised Dirac
operators have to be revisited. We show that in supersymmetric configurations
the fermionic operators decouple, so that there are no mixing effects between
different fermions in the index theorems. We extend the index theorems in
presence of torsion to the generic case of manifolds with boundary, which
naturally appear in string solutions and apply this result to the soliton
solution by Callan, Harvey and Strominger.
