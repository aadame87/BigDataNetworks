  A lagrangian euclidean model of Drinfeld--Sokolov (DS) reduction leading to
general $W$--algebras on a Riemann surface of any genus is presented. The
background geometry is given by the DS principal bundle $K$ associated to a
complex Lie group $G$ and an $SL(2,\Bbb C)$ subgroup $S$. The basic fields are
a hermitian fiber metric $H$ of $K$ and a $(0,1)$ Koszul gauge field $A^*$ of
$K$ valued in a certain negative graded subalgebra $\goth x$ of $\goth g$
related to $\goth s$. The action governing the $H$ and $A^*$ dynamics is the
effective action of a DS field theory in the geometric background specified by
$H$ and $A^*$. Quantization of $H$ and $A^*$ implements on one hand the DS
reduction and on the other defines a novel model of $2d$ gravity, DS gravity.
The gauge fixing of the DS gauge symmetry yields an integration on a moduli
space of DS gauge equivalence classes of $A^*$ configurations, the DS moduli
space. The model has a residual gauge symmetry associated to the DS gauge
transformations leaving a given field $A^*$ invariant. This is the DS
counterpart of conformal symmetry. Conformal invariance and certain non
perturbative features of the model are discussed in detail.
