  In this paper, the relationship between the sine-Gordon model with an
integrable boundary condition and the Thirring model with boundary is discussed
and the reflection $R$-matrix for the massive Thirring model, which is related
to the physical boundary parameters of the sine-Gordon model, is given. The
relationship between the the boundary parameters and the two formal parameters
appearing in the work of Ghoshal and Zamolodchikov is discussed.
