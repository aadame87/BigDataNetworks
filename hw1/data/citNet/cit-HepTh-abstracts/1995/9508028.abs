  There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergent
graphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantum
field theories. Whereupon we may establish a new method, the intrinsic
regularization method, to regularize those divergent graphs. In this paper, we
apply this method to QCD at the one loop order. It turns out to be
satisfactory:The gauge invariance is preserved manifestly and the results are
the same as those derived by means of other regularization methods.
