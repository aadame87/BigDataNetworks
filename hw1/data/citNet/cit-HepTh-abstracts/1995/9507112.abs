  We analyze in detail the possible breaking of spacetime supersymmetry under
T-duality transformations. We find that when appropiate world-sheet effects are
taken into account apparent puzzles concerning supersymmetry in spacetime are
solved. We study T-duality in general heterotic $\sigma$-models analyzing
possible anomalies, and we find some modifications of Buscher's rules. We then
work out a simple but representative example which contains most of the
difficulties. We also consider the issue of supersymmetry versus duality for
marginal deformations of WZW models and present a mechanism that restores
supersymmetry dynamically in the effective theory.
