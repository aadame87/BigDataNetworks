  The complete renormalization procedure of a general N=1 supersymmetric gauge
theory in the Wess-Zumino gauge is presented, using the regulator free
``algebraic renormalization'' procedure. Both gauge invariance and
supersymmetry are included into one single BRS invariance. The form of the
general nonabelian anomaly is given. Furthermore, it is explained how the gauge
BRS and the supersymmetry functional operators can be extracted from the
general BRS operator. It is then shown that the supersymmetry operators
actually belong to the closed, finite, Wess-Zumino superalgebra when their
action is restricted to the space of the ``gauge invariant operators'', i.e. to
the cohomology classes of the gauge BRS operator. An erratum is added at the
end of the paper.
