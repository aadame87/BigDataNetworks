Title: A Superspace Formulation for the Master Equation
Authors: Everton M. C. Abreu and Nelson R. F. Braga
Comments: The constrained nature of standard BRST superfields and the
  importance of using Alfaro and Damgaard's collective fields in the superspace
  approach to avoid undefined superfield derivatives was emphasized. To appear

  It is shown that the quantum master equation of the Field Antifield
quantization method at one loop order can be translated into the requirement of
a superfield structure for the action. The Pauli Villars regularization is
implemented in this BRST superspace and the case of anomalous gauge theories is
investigated. The quantum action, including Wess Zumino terms, shows up as one
of the components of a superfield that includes the BRST anomalies in the other
component. The example of W2 quantum gravity is also discussed.
