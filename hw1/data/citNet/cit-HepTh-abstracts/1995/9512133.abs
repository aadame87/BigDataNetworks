  This paper is based on lectures presented to mathematical physicists and
attempts to provide an overview of the present status of the Standard Model,
its experimental tests, phenomenological and experimental motivations for going
beyond the Standard Model via supersymmetry and grand unification, and ways to
test these ideas with particle accelerators.
