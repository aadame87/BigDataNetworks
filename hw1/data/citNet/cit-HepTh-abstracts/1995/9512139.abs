  An introduction to $N=2$ rigid and local supersymmetry is given. The
construction of the actions of vector multiplets is reviewed, defining special
K\"ahler manifolds. Symplectic transformations lead to either isometries or
symplectic reparametrizations. Writing down a symplectic formulation of special
geometry clarifies the relation to the moduli spaces of a Riemann surface or a
Calabi-Yau 3-fold. The scheme for obtaining perturbative and non-perturbative
corrections to a supersymmetry model is explained. The Seiberg-Witten model is
reviewed as an example of the identification of duality symmetries with
monodromies and symmetries of the associated moduli space of a Riemann surface.
