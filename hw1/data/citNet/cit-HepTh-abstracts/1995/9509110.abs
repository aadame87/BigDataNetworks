  We show that when the Abelian \CS\ theory coupled to matter fields is
quantized in a vacuum with non vanishing magnetic flux (or electric charge),
the requirement of gauge invariance at finite temperature leads to the
quantization of the \CS\ coefficient and its quantum corrections, in a manner
similar to the non-Abelian case.
