  Standard lattice-space formulations of quartic self-coupled Euclidean scalar
quantum fields become trivial in the continuum limit for sufficiently high
space-time dimensions, and in particular the moment generating functional for
space-time smeared fields becomes a Gaussian appropriate to that of a (possibly
generalized) free field. For sharp-time fields this fact implies that the
ground-state expectation functional also becomes Gaussian in the continuum
limit. To overcome these consequences of the central limit theorem, an
auxiliary, nonclassical potential is appended to the original lattice form of
the model and parameters are tuned so that a generalized Poisson field
distribution emerges in the continuum limit for the ground-state probability
distribution. As a consequence, the sharp-time expectation functional is
infinitely divisible, but the Hamiltonian operator is such, in the general
case, that the generating functional for the space-time smeared field is not
infinitely divisible in Minkowski space. This feature permits the models in
question to escape a manifestly trivial scattering matrix imposed on all
infinitely divisible covariant Minkowski fields. Two sequentially related
proposals for an alternative lattice formulation of interacting covariant
models in four and more space-time dimensions are analyzed in some detail.
