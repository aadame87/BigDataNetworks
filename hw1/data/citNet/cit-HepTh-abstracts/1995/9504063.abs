  We analyze the gaugino condensation in the effective theory for N=1 SU(N)
Supersymmetric QCD with $N_{f}$ flavors. It is known that taking the vacuum
expectation value of the matter field to be infinite, we can show that gaugino
condensation can occur. At such a limit we should consider only pure
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. But when we include an interaction term of
order $O(\frac{1}{v})$, the situation can change. We analyze the effect of this
interaction term and examine the gaugino condensation in the low energy
Yang-Mills theory by using the scheme of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio.
