  Changes of variables giving the dual model are constructed explicitly for
sigma-models without isotropy. In particular, the jacobian is calculated to
give the known results. The global aspects of the abelian case as well as some
of those of the cases where the isometry group is simply connected are
considered.
        Considering the anomalous case, we infer by a consistency argument that
the `multiplicative anomaly' should be replaceable by adequate rules for
factorization of composite jacobians. These rules are then generalized in a
simple way for composite jacobians defined in spaces of different types.
Implimentation of these rules then gives specific formulas for the anomally for
semisimple algebras and also for solvable ones.
