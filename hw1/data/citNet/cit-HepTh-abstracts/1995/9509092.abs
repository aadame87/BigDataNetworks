  It is demonstrated that the action of SU$(N)$ principal chiral model leads in
the limit $N \to {\infty}$ to the action for Husain's heavenly equation. The
principal chiral model in the Hilbert space $L^2(\Re^1)$ is considered and it
is shown, that in this case the chiral equation is equivalent to the Moyal
deformation of Husain's heavenly equation. New method of searching for
solutions to this latter equation, via Lie algebra representations in
$L^2(\Re^1)$ is given.
