The 2-point function is the natural object in quantum gravity for extracting
critical behavior: The exponential fall off of the 2-point function with
geodesic distance determines the fractal dimension $d_H$ of space-time. The
integral of the 2-point function determines the entropy exponent $\gamma$, i.e.
the fractal structure related to baby universes, while the short distance
behavior of the 2-point function connects $\gamma$ and $d_H$ by a quantum
gravity version of Fisher's scaling relation. We verify this behavior in the
case of 2d gravity by explicit calculation.
