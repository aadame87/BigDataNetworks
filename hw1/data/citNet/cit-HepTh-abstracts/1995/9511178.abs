  We review the status of duality symmetries in superstring theories. These
discrete symmetries mark the striking differences between theories of pointlike
objects and theories of extended objects. They prove to be very helpful in
understanding non-perturbative effects in string theories. We will also briefly
discuss the strange role played by open strings and their solitons in the
emerging scenario.
