  The problems of Classical Electrodynamics with the electron equation of
motion and with non-integrable singularity of its self-field stress tensor are
well known. They are consequences, we show, of neglecting terms that are null
off the charge world line but that gives a non null contribution on its world
line. The self-field stress tensor of a point classical electron is integrable,
there is no causality violation and no conflict with energy conservation in its
equation of motion, and there is no need of any kind of renormalization nor of
any change in the Maxwell's theory for this.
  (This is part of the paper hep-th/9510160, stripped , for simplicity, of
its non-Minkowskian geometrization of causality and of its discussion about
the physical meaning of the Maxwell-Faraday concept of field).
