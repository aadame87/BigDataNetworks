  We discuss the target-space interpretation of the world-sheet logarithmic
operators in string theory. These operators generate the normalizable zero
modes (discrete states) in target space, which restore the symmetries of the
theory broken by the background. The problem of the recoil in string theory is
considered, as well as some general properties of string amplitudes containing
logarithmic operators.
