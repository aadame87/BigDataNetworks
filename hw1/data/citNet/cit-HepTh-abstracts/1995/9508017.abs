  We show how the exact renormalization group for the effective action with a
sharp momentum cutoff, may be organised by expanding one-particle irreducible
parts in terms of homogeneous functions of momenta of integer degree (Taylor
expansions not being possible). A systematic series of approximations -- the
$O(p^M)$ approximations -- result from discarding from these parts, all terms
of higher than the $M^{\rm th}$ degree. These approximations preserve a field
reparametrization invariance, ensuring that the field's anomalous dimension is
unambiguously determined. The lowest order approximation coincides with the
local potential approximation to the Wegner-Houghton equations. We discuss the
practical difficulties with extending the approximation beyond $O(p^0)$.
