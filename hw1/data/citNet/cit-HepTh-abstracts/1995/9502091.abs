The theory of matrix models is reviewed from the point of view of its relation
to integrable hierarchies. Determinantal formulas, relation to conformal field
models and the theory of Generalized Kontsevich model are discussed in some
detail. Attention is also paid to the group-theoretical interpretation of
$\tau$-functions which allows to go beyond the restricted set of the
(multicomponent) KP and Toda integrable hierarchies.
