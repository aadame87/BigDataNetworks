  Translationally invariant symmetric polynomials as coordinates for $N$-body
problems with identical particles are proposed. It is shown that in those
coordinates the Calogero and Sutherland $N$-body Hamiltonians, after
appropriate gauge transformations, can be presented as a {\it quadratic}
polynomial in the generators of the algebra $sl_N$ in finite-dimensional
degenerate representation. The exact solvability of these models follows from
the existence of the infinite flag of such representation spaces, preserved by
the above Hamiltonians. A connection with Jack polynomials is discussed.
