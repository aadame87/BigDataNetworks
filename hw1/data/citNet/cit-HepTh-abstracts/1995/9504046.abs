  Recently we have shown that a phase transition occurs in the leading
approximation of the large N limit in rigid strings coupled to long range
Kalb-Ramond interactions. The disordered phase is essentially the
Nambu-Goto-Polyakov string theory while the ordered phase is a new theory. In
this part II letter we study the first sub-leading quantum corrections we
started in I. We derive the renormalized mass gap equation and obtain the
renormalized critical line of the interacting theory. Our main and final result
is that the phase transition does indeed survive quantum fluctuations.
