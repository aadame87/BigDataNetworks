  Basic quantities related to 2-D gravity, such as Polyakov extrinsic action,
Nambu-Goto action, geometrical action, and Euler characteristic are studied
using generalized Weierstrass-Enneper (GWE) inducing of surfaces. Connection of
the GWE inducing with conformal immersion is made and varius aspects of the
theory are shown to be invariant under the modified Veselov-Novikov hierarchy
of flows. The geometry of certain surfaces is shown to be connected with the
dynamics of infinite and finite dimensional integrable systems. Connections to
Liouville-Beltrami gravity are indicated.
