  We show that the formation of condensates in the presence of a constant
magnetic field in 2+1 dimensions is extremely unstable. It disappears as soon
as a heat bath is introduced with or without a chemical potential. We point out
some new nonanalytic behavior that develops in this system at finite
temperature.
