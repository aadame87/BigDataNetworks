  We study the BPS spectrum in $D=4, N=4$ heterotic string compactifications,
with some emphasis on intermediate $N=4$ BPS states. These intermediate states,
which can become short in $N=2$ compactifications, are crucial for establishing
an $S-T$ exchange symmetry in $N=2$ compactifications. We discuss the
implications of a possible $S-T$ exchange symmetry for the $N=2$ BPS spectrum.
Then we present the exact result for the 1-loop corrections to gravitational
couplings in one of the heterotic $N=2$ models recently discussed by Harvey and
Moore. We conjecture this model to have an $S-T$ exchange symmetry. This
exchange symmetry can then be used to evaluate non-perturbative corrections to
gravitational couplings in some of the non-perturbative regions (chambers) in
this particular model and also in other heterotic models.
