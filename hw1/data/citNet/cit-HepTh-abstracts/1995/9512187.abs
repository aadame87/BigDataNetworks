  Solvable theories of 2D dilaton gravity can be obtained from a Liouville
theory by suitable field redefinitions. In this paper we propose a new
framework to generate 2D dilaton gravity models which can also be exactly
solved in the semiclassical approximation. Our approach is based on the
recently introduced scheme to quantize massless scalar fields coupled to 2D
gravity maintaining invariance under area-preserving diffeomorphisms and Weyl
transformations. Starting from the CGHS model with the new effective action we
reestablish the full diffeomorphism invariance by means of an adequate family
of field redefinitions. The original theory is therefore mapped into a large
family of solvable models. We focus our analysis on the one-parameter class of
models interpolating between the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius model and the
Bose-Parker-Peleg model. Finally we shall briefly indicate how can we extend
our approach to spherically symmetric Einstein gravity coupled to 2D conformal
matter.
