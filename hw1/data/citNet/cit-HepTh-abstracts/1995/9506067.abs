  We study boundary bound states using the Bethe ansatz formalism for the
finite $XXZ$ $(\Delta>1)$ chain in a boundary magnetic field $h$. Boundary
bound states are represented by the ``boundary strings'' similar to those
described in the work of H.Saleur, S.Skorik. We find that for certain values of
$h$ the ground state wave function contains boundary strings, and from this
infer the existence of two ``critical'' fields in agreement with the results of
Jimbo et al. An expression for the vacuum surface energy in the thermodynamic
limit is derived and found to be an analytic function of $h$. We argue that
boundary excitations appear only in pairs with ``bulk'' excitations or with
boundary excitations at the other end of the chain. We mainly discuss the case
where the magnetic fields at the left and the right boundaries are
antiparallel, but we also comment on the case of the parallel fields. In the
Ising ($\Delta=\infty$) and isotropic ($\Delta=1$) limits our results agree
with those previously known.
