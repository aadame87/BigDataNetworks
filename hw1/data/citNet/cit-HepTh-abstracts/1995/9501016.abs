Conventional quantization of two-dimensional diffeomorphism and Weyl invariant
theories sacrifices the latter symmetry to anomalies, while maintaining the
former. When alternatively Weyl invariance is preserved by abandoning
diffeomorphism invariance, we find that some invariance against coordinate
redefinition remains: one can still perform at will transformations possessing
a constant Jacobian. The alternate approach enjoys as much ``gauge'' symmetry
as the conventional formulation.
