  The Hamiltonian formulation for a non-Abelian gauge theory in two spatial
dimensions is carried out in terms of a gauge-invariant matrix parametrization
of the fields. The Jacobian for the relevant transformation of variables is
given in terms of the WZW-action for a hermitian matrix field. Some
gauge-invariant eigenstates of the kinetic term of the Hamiltonian are given;
these have zero charge and exhibit a mass gap.
