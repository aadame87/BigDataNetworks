  The Landau-Ginzburg formulation of two-dimensional topological sigma models
on the target space with positive first Chern class is considered. The
effective Landau-Ginzburg superpotential takes the form of logarithmic type
which is characteristic of supersymmetric theories with the mass gap. The
equations of motion yield the defining relations of the quantum cohomology
ring. Topological correlation functions in the $CP^{n-1}$ and Grassmannian
models are explicitly evaluated with the use of the logarithmic superpotential.
