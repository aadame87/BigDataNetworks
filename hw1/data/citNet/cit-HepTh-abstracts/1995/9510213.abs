  The previously proposed generalized action principle approach to
supersymmetric extended objects is considered in some details for the case of
heterotic string in $D=3, 4, 6 ~and~ 10$ space--time dimensions. The proof of
the 'off--shell' superdiffeomorphism invariance of the generalized action is
presented. The doubly supersymmetric geometric approach to heterotic string is
constructed on the basis of generalized action principle (instead of the
geometrodynamic condition, used for this previously). It is demonstrated that
$D=3$ heterotic string is described by $n=(1,0)$ supersymmetric generalization
of the nonlinear Liouville equation.
