  Global N=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions with a gauged central charge is
formulated in superspace. To find an irreducible representation of
supersymmetry for the gauge connections a set of constraints is given. Then the
Bianchi identities are solved subject to this set of constraints. It is shown
that the gauge connection of the central charge is a N=2 vector multiplet.
Moreover the Bogomol'nyi bound of the massive particle states is studied.
