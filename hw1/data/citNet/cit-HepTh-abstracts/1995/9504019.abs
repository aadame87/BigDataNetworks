  A number of attempts have recently been made to extend the conjectured $S$
duality of Yang Mills theory to gravity. Central to these speculations has been
the belief that electrically and magnetically charged black holes, the solitons
of quantum gravity, have identical quantum properties. This is not obvious,
because although duality is a symmetry of the classical equations of motion, it
changes the sign of the Maxwell action. Nevertheless, we show that the chemical
potential and charge projection that one has to introduce for electric but not
magnetic black holes exactly compensate for the difference in action in the
semi-classical approximation. In particular, we show that the pair production
of electric black holes is not a runaway process, as one might think if one
just went by the action of the relevant instanton. We also comment on the
definition of the entropy in cosmological situations, and show that we need to
be more careful when defining the entropy than we are in an asymptotically-flat
case.
