  The conformal transformation in the Einstein - Hilbert action leads to a new
frame where an extra scalar degree of freedom is compensated by the local
conformal-like symmetry. We write down a most general action resulting from
such transformation and show that it covers both general relativity and
conformally coupled to gravity scalar field as the particular cases. On quantum
level the equivalence between the different frames is disturbed by the loop
corrections. New conformal-like symmetry in anomalous and, as a result, the
theory is not finite on shell at the one-loop order.
