We study symmetry breaking in the static coordinate-system of de Sitter space.
This is done with the help of the functional-Schr\"odinger approach used in
previous calculations by Ratra [1]. We consider a massless, minimally coupled
scalar field as the parameter of a continuous symmetry (the angular component
of an O(2) symmetry). Then we study the correlation function of the massless
scalar field, to derive the correlation function of the original field, which
finally shows the restoration of the continuous symmetry.
