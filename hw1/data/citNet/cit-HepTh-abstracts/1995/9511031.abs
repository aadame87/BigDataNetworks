  Using the renormalization-group formalism, a sigma model of a special type-
in which the metric and the dilaton depend explicitly on one of the string
coordinates only-is investigated near two dimensions. It is seen that dilatonic
gravity coupled to N scalar fields can be expressed in this form, using a
string parametrization, and that it possesses the usual UV fixed point.
However,in this stringy parametrization of the theory the fixed point for the
scalar-dilaton coupling turns out to be trivial, while the fixed point for the
gravitational coupling remains to be the same as in previous studies being, in
particular, non-trivial.
