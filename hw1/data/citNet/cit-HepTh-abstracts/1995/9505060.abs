  A supersymmetric extension of the color Calogero-Sutherland model is
considered based on the Yangian $Y(gl(n|m))$. The algebraic structure of the
model is discussed in some details. We show that the commuting conserved
quantities can be generated from the super-quantum determinant, thus
establishing the integrability of the model. In addition, rational limit of the
model is studied where the Yangian symmetry degenerates into a super loop
algebra.
