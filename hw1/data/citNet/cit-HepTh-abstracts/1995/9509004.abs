  We study the perturbation theory for the general non-integrable chiral Potts
model depending on two chiral angles and a strength parameter and show how the
analyticity of the ground state energy and correlation functions dramatically
increases when the angles and the strength parameter satisfy the integrability
condition. We further specialize to the superintegrable case and verify that a
sum rule is obeyed.
