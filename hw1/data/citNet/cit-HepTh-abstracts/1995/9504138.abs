  A manifestly $N=2$ supersymmetric coset formalism is introduced to describe
integrable hierarchies. It is applied to analyze the super-NLS equation. It
possesses an $N=2$ symmetry since it can be obtained from a manifest $N=2$
coset algebra construction. A remarkable result is here discussed: the
existence of a B\"{a}cklund transformation which connects the super-NLS
equation to the equations belonging to the integrable hierarchy of one
particular (the $a=4$) $N=2$ super-KdV equation. $N=2$ scalar Lax pair
operators are introduced for both super-KdV and super-NLS.
