  New geometrical features of the Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds are presented, for
models with a typical type of superpotential. We show the one-to-one
correspondence between some of the $(a,c)$ states with $U(1)$ charges $(-1,1)$
and the integral points on the dual polyhedra, which are useful tools for the
construction of mirror manifolds. Relying on toric geometry, these states are
shown to correspond to the $(1,1)$ forms coming from blowing-up processes. In
terms of the above identification, it can be checked that the monomial-divisor
mirror map for Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds, proposed by the author, is equivalent
to that mirror map for Calabi-Yau manifolds obtained by the mathematicians.
