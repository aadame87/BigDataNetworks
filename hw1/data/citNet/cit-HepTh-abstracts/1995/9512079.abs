  A general construction is found for `topological' singular vectors of the
twisted N=2 superconformal algebra. It demonstrates many parallels with the
known construction for sl(2) singular vectors due to Malikov--Feigin--Fuchs,
but is formulated independently of the latter. The two constructions taken
together provide an isomorphism between topological and sl(2)- singular
vectors. The general formula for topological singular vectors can be
reformulated as a chain of direct recursion relations that allow one to derive
a given singular vector |S(r,s)> from the lower ones |S(r,s'<s)>. We also
introduce generalized Verma modules over the twisted N=2 algebra and show that
they provide a natural setup for the new construction for topological singular
vectors.
