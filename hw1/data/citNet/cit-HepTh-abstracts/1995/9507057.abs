  It is shown that graphs that generalize the ADE Dynkin diagrams and have
appeared in various contexts of two-dimensional field theory may be regarded in
a natural way as encoding the geometry of a root system. After recalling what
are the conditions satisfied by these graphs, we define a bilinear form on a
root system in terms of the adjacency matrices of these graphs and undertake
the study of the group generated by the reflections in the hyperplanes
orthogonal to these roots. Some ``non integrally laced " graphs are shown to be
associated with subgroups of these reflection groups. The empirical relevance
of these graphs in the classification of conformal field theories or in the
construction of integrable lattice models is recalled, and the connections with
recent developments in the context of ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theories and
topological field theories are discussed.
