The fourth derivative models for two dimensional gravity are shown to be
equivalent to the special version of the nonlinear sigma models coupled to 2d
quantum gravity. The reduction consists in the introduction of the auxiliary
scalar fields and can be performed in an explicit way for both metric and
general metric-dilaton cases. In view of this we can evaluate the structure of
possible counterterms and show that they contains second derivative structures
only. The calculations in the theory with an auxiliary fields require some
special procedure to be applied. We perform the explicit calculations in a
different gauges and explore the features of the auxiliary fields.
