  Following Sutherland's work on one-dimensional integrable systems we
formulate and study its two-dimensional version. Physically it expresses the
absence of true 3-body forces among an assembly of N particles leaving
exclusively effective 2-body interactions. This criterion may be a suitable
candidate for an integrability condition.
