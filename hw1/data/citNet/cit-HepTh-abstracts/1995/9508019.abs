  An Introduction to Hopf algebras as a tool for the regularization of relavent
quantities in quantum field theory is given. We deform algebraic spaces by
introducing q as a regulator of a non-commutative and non-cocommutative Hopf
algebra. Relevant quantities are finite provided q\neq 1 and diverge in the
limit q\rightarrow 1. We discuss q-regularization on different q-deformed
spaces for \lambda\phi^4 theory as example to illustrate the idea.
