Title: String-Membrane Duality in Seven Dimensions
Author: P.K. Townsend
Comments: The original version of this paper dealt mostly with one side of
  string-membrane duality: the solitonic interpretation of the heterotic string
  as a $K_3$ compactified D=11 superfivebrane. The revised version includes a
  discussion of the converse prediction: that the supermembrane has a solitonic
  interpretation as a $T^3$ compactified heterotic fivebrane. It also includes
  a discussion of D=8 membrane-membrane duality, and various changes to the
  references

  The conjectured equivalence of the heterotic string to a $K_3$ compactified
type IIA superstring is combined with the conjectured equivalence of the latter
to a compactified 11-dimensional supermembrane to derive a string membrane
duality in seven dimensions; the membrane is a soliton of the string theory and
vice versa. A prediction of this duality is that the heterotic string is a
$K_3$ compactification of the solitonic 11-dimensional fivebrane. It is
verified that the worldsheet action of the D=10 heterotic string is indeed
obtainable by $K_3$ compactification of the worldvolume action of the
11-dimensional fivebrane, and it is suggested how the worldvolume action of the
D=11 supermebrane may be similarly obtained by $T^3$ compactification of the
worldvolume action of a D=10 heterotic fivebrane. Generalizations to $D=8$
string-threebrane and membrane-membrane duality are also discussed.
