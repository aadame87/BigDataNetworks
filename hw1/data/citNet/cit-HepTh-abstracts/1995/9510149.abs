  Conformal field theory at $c=-2$ provides the simplest example of a theory
with ``logarithmic'' operators. We examine in detail the $(\xi,\eta)$ ghost
system and Coulomb gas construction at $c=-2$ and show that, in
contradistinction to minimal models, they can not be described in terms of
conformal families of {\em primary\/} fields alone but necessarily contain
reducible but indecomposable representations of the Virasoro algebra. We then
present a construction of ``logarithmic'' operators in terms of ``symplectic''
fermions displaying a global $SL(2)$ symmetry. Orbifolds with respect to finite
subgroups of $SL(2)$ are reminiscent of the $ADE$ classification of $c=1$
modular invariant partition functions, but are isolated models and not linked
by massless flows.
