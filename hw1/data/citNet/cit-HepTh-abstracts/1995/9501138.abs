We consider the recently obtained integral representation of quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation of level 0. We obtain the condition for the
integral kernel such that these solutions satisfy three axioms for form factor
\'{a} la Smirnov. We discuss the relation between this integral representation
and the form factor of XXZ spin chain.
