The stability of a new class of hairy black hole solutions in the coupled
system of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs is examined, generalising a method
suggested by Brodbeck and Straumann and collaborators, and Volkov and Gal'tsov.
The method maps the algebraic system of linearised radial perturbations of the
various field modes around the black hole solution into a coupled system of
radial equations of Schr\"odinger type. No detailed knowledge of the black hole
solution is required, except from the fact that the boundary conditions at the
physical space-time boundaries (horizons) must be such so as to guarantee the
{\it finiteness} of the various expressions involved. In this way, it is
demonstrated that the above Schr\"odinger equations have bound states, which
implies the instability of the associated black hole solution.
