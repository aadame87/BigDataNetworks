  A recent development of the studies on classical and quasi-classical
properties of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in Witten's version is reviewed.
First, classical mechanics of a supersymmetric system is considered. Solutions
of the classical equations of motion are given and their properties are
discussed in some detail. The corresponding quantum model is constructed by
canonical quantization. The quantum model is analyzed by Feynman's path
integral within a stationary-phase approximation. A quasi-classical
quantization rule is derived, which is applicable when supersymmetry is exact
or spontaneously broken.
