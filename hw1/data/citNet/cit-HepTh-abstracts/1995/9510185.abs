  We describe three different approaches to the extended (N=2)
supersymmetrization of the multicomponent KP hierarchy. In the first one we
utilize only superfermions while in the second only superbosons and in the
third superbosons as well as superfermions. It is shown that many soliton
equations can be embedded in the supersymmetry theory by using the first
approach even if we do not change these equations in the bosonic limit of the
supersymmetry. In the second or third approach we obtain a generalization of
the soliton equations in the bosonic limit which remains in the class of the
usual commuting functions. As the byproduct of our analysis we prove that for
the first procedure the bosonic part of the one--component supersym\-me\-tric
KP hierarchy coincides with the usual classical two--component KP hierarchy.
