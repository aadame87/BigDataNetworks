  A model describing the $N=2$ supergravity interaction with vector and linear
multiplets is constructed. It admits the introduction of the spontaneous
breaking of supersymmetry with arbitrary scales, one of which may be equal to
zero, which corresponds to partial super-Higgs effect ($N=2 \rightarrow N=1$).
A cosmological term is automatically equal to zero.
