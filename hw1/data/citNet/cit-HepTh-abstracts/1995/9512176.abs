  We continue the study of symmetries in the Lagrangian formalism of arbitrary
order with the help of the so-called Anderson-Duchamp-Krupka equations. For the
case of second-order equations and arbitrary vector fields we are able to
establish a polynomial structure in the second-order derivatives. This
structure is based on the some linear combinations of Olver hyper-Jacobians. We
use as the main tools Fock space techniques and induction. This structure can
be used to analyze Lagrangian systems with groups of Noetherian symmetries. As
an illustration we analyze the case of Lagrangian equations with Abelian gauge
invariance.
