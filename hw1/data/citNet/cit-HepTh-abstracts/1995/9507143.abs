Title: The Decay of Magnetic Fields in Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: Fay Dowker, Jerome Gauntlett, Gary Gibbons, and Gary Horowitz
Comments: 25 pages, one figure. The discussion of fermions has been revised: We
  show how fundamental fermions can eliminate the bubble-type instability but
  still allow pair creation of monopoles

  Magnetic fields in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory compactified on a
circle correspond to ``twisted'' identifications of five dimensional Minkowski
space. We show that a five dimensional generalisation of the Kerr solution can
be analytically continued to construct an instanton that gives rise to two
possible decay modes of a magnetic field. One decay mode is the generalisation
of the ``bubble decay" of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum described by Witten. The
other decay mode, rarer for weak fields, corresponds in four dimensions to the
creation of monopole-anti-monopole pairs. An instanton for the latter process
is already known and is given by the analytic continuation of the \KK\ Ernst
metric, which we show is identical to the five dimensional Kerr solution. We
use this fact to illuminate further properties of the decay process. It appears
that fundamental fermions can eliminate the bubble decay of the magnetic field,
while allowing the pair production of Kaluza-Klein monopoles.
