We study exact renormalization group equations in the framework of the
effective average action. We present analytical approximate solutions for the
scale dependence of the potential in a variety of models. These solutions
display a rich spectrum of physical behaviour such as fixed points governing
the universal behaviour near second order phase transitions, critical
exponents, first order transitions (some of which are radiatively induced) and
tricritical behaviour.
