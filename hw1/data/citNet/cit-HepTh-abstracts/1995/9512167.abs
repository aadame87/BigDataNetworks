  of freedom
Author: Khazret S. Nirov
Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, no figures
Report-no: A part of the talk presented at the 8th Int'l Seminar ``Quarks'94'',
  May 11-18, 1994, Vladimir, Russia (pp. 486-491 of the Procs., eds.: D. Yu.

  The relationship between various methods to calculate the physical degrees of
freedom for gauge invariant systems of a general form is established. The set
of hidden parameters caused for the superfluous degrees of freedom is revealed.
