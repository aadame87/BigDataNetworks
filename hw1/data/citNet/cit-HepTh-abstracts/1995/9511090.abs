Title: Field Theory Entropy, the $H$-theorem and the Renormalization Group
Authors: Jose Gaite and Denjoe O'Connor
Comments: 25 pages, plain TeX (macros included), 6 ps figures. Addition in
  title. Entropy of cutoff Gaussian model modified in section 4 to avoid a
  divergence. Therefore, last figure modified. Other minor changes to improve
  readability. Version to appear in Phys. Rev. D

  We consider entropy and relative entropy in Field theory and establish
relevant monotonicity properties with respect to the couplings. The relative
entropy in a field theory with a hierarchy of renormalization group fixed
points ranks the fixed points, the lowest relative entropy being assigned to
the highest multicritical point. We argue that as a consequence of a
generalized $H$ theorem Wilsonian RG flows induce an increase in entropy and
propose the relative entropy as the natural quantity which increases from one
fixed point to another in more than two dimensions.
