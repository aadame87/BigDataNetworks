  The double-scaling limit of the supereigenvalue model is performed in the
moment description. This description proves extremely useful for the
identification of the multi-critical points in the space of bosonic and
fermionic coupling constants. An iterative procedure for the calculation of
higher-genus contributions to the free energy and to the multi-loop correlators
in the double-scaling limit is developed. We present the general structure of
these quantities at genus g and give explicit results up to and including genus
two.
