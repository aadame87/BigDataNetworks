  We calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of anyons in three dimensional
$CP^{N-1}$ model with a Chern-Simons term in various limits in $1/N$ expansion.
We have found that for anyons of infinite mass the gyromagnetic ratio
($g$-factor) is 2 up to the next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Our result supports
a recent claim that the $g$-factor of nonrelativistic anyons is exactly two. We
also found that for $-{8\over\pi }<\theta<0$, the electromagnetic interation
between two identical aynons of large mass are attractive.
