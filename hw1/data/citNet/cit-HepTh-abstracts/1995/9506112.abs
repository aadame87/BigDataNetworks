  We analyze the map between heterotic and type II N=2 supersymmetric string
theories for certain two and three moduli examples found by Kachru and Vafa.
The appearance of elliptic j-functions can be traced back to specializations of
the Picard-Fuchs equations to systems for $K_3$ surfaces. For the three-moduli
example we write the mirror maps and Yukawa couplings in the weak coupling
limit in terms of j-functions; the expressions agree with those obtained in
perturbative calculations in the heterotic string in an impressive way. We also
discuss symmetries of the world-sheet instanton numbers in the type II theory,
and interpret them in terms of S--duality of the non-perturbative heterotic
string.
