  It has been argued that any evolution law taking pure states to mixed states
in quantum field theory necessarily gives rise to violations of either
causality or energy-momentum conservation, in such a way as to have
unacceptable consequences for ordinary laboratory physics. We show here that
this is not the case by giving a simple class of examples of Markovian
evolution laws where rapid evolution from pure states to mixed states occurs
for a wide class of states with appropriate properties at the ``Planck scale",
suitable locality and causality properties hold for all states, and the
deviations from ordinary dynamics (and, in particular, violations of
energy-momentum conservation) are unobservably small for all states which one
could expect to produce in a laboratory. In addition, we argue (via
consideration of other, non-Markovian models) that conservation of energy and
momentum for all states is not fundamentally incompatible with causality in
dynamical models in which pure states evolve to mixed states.
