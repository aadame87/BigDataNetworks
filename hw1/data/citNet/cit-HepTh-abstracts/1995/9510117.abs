  We reexamine the graceful exit problem in the Pre-Big-Bang inflationary
scenario. The dilaton-gravity action is generalized by adding the axion and a
general axion/dilaton potential. We provide a phase space analysis of the
dynamics which leads us to extend the previous no-go theorem and rule out the
branch change necessary for graceful exit in this context.
