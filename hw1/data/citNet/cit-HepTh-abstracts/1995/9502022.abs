Title: Soliton solutions of the classical lattice sine-Gordon system
Author: B. Enriquez
\\
We study the soliton-type solutions of the system introduced by B. Feigin and
the author in in [EF]. We show that it reduces to a top-like system, and we
study the behaviour of the solutions at the lattice infinity. We compute the
scattering of the solitons and study some periodic solutions of the system.
