  We find that the energy spectra of four and five anyons in a harmonic
potential exhibit some mirror symmetric (reflection symmetric about the
semionic statistics point $\theta=\pi/2$) features analogous to the mirror
symmetry in the two and three anyon spectra. However, since the $\ell=0$ sector
remains non-mirror symmetric, the fourth and fifth virial coeffients do not
reflect this symmetry.
