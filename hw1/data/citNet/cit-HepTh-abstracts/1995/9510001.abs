\\
  The generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov construction of KdV systems is reviewed in
the case of an arbitrary affine Lie algebra paying particular attention to
Hamiltonian aspects and $\W$-algebras. Some extensions of known results as well
as a new interpretation of the construction are also presented.
