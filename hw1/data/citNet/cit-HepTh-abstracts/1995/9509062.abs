  To describe a massive particle with fixed, but arbitrary, spin on $d=4$
anti-de Sitter space $M^4$, we propose the point-particle model with
configuration space ${\cal M}^6 = M^{4}\times S^{2}$, where the sphere $S^2$
corresponds to the spin degrees of freedom. The model possesses two gauge
symmetries expressing strong conservation of the phase-space counterparts of
the second- and fourth-order Casimir operators for $so(3,2)$. We prove that the
requirement of energy to have a global positive minimum $E_o$ over the
configuration space is equivalent to the relation $E_o > s$, $s$ being the
particle's spin, what presents the classical counterpart of the quantum massive
condition. States with the minimal energy are studied in detail. The model is
shown to be exactly solvable. It can be straightforwardly generalized to
describe a spinning particle on $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter space $M^d$,
with ${\cal M}^{2(d-1)} = M^d \times S^{(d-2)}$ the corresponding configuration
space.
