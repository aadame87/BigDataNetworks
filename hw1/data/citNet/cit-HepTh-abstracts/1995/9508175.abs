  We present new supersymmetric extensions of Conformal Toda and $A^{(1)}_N$
Affine Toda field theories. These new theories are constructed using methods
similar to those that have been developed to find supersymmetric extensions of
two-dimensional bosonic sigma models with a scalar potential. In particular, we
show that the Conformal Toda field theory admits a (1,1)-supersymmetric
extension, and the $A^{(1)}_N$ Affine Toda field admits a (1,0)-supersymmetric
extension.
