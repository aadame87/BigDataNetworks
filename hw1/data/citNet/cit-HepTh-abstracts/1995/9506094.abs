  The superfield formulation of two - dimensional $N=4$ Extended Supersymmetric
Quantum Mechanics (SQM) is described. It is shown that corresponding classical
Lagrangian describes the motion in the conformally flat metric with additional
potential term. The Bose and Fermi sectors of two- and three-dimensional $N=4$
SQM are analyzed. The structure of the quantum Hamiltonians is such, that the
usual Shr\"{o}dinger equation in the flat space arises after some unitary
transformation, demonstrating the effect of transmutation of the coupling
constant and the energy of the initial model in some special cases.
