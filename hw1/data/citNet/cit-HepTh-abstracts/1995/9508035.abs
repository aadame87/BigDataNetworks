  The basic mathematical assumptions for autonomous linear kinetic equations
for a classical system are formulated, leading to the conclusion that if they
are differential equations on its phase space $M$, they are at most of the 2nd
order. For open systems interacting with a bath at canonical equilibrium they
have a particular form of an equation of a generalized Fokker-Planck type. We
show that it is possible to obtain them as Liouville equations of Hamiltonian
dynamics on $M$ with a particular non-commutative differential structure,
provided certain geometric in character, conditions are fulfilled. To this end,
symplectic geometry on $M$ is developped in this context, and an outline of the
required tensor analysis and differential geometry is given. Certain questions
for the possible mathematical interpretation of this structure are also
discussed.
