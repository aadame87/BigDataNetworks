  Some new developments in constrained Lax integrable systems and their
applications to physics are reviewed. After summarizing the tau function
construction of the KP hierarchy and the basic concepts of the symmetry of
nonlinear equations, more recent ideas dealing with constrained KP models are
described. A unifying approach to constrained KP hierarchy based on graded
$SL(r+n,n)$ algebra is presented and equivalence formulas are obtained for
various pseudo-differential Lax operators appearing in this context. It is then
shown how the Toda lattice structure emerges from constrained KP models via
canonical Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations. These transformations enable us
to find simple Wronskian solutions for the underlying tau-functions. We also
establish a relation between two-matrix models and constrained Toda lattice
systems and derive from this relation expressions for the corresponding
partition function.
