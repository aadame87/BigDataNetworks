  Aspects of the monopole condensation picture of confinement are discussed.
First, the nature of the monopole singularities in the abelian projection
approach is analysed. Their apparent gauge dependence is shown to have a
natural interpretation in terms of 't~Hooft-Polyakov-like monopoles in
euclidean SU(2) gauge theory. Next, the results and predictions of a
realization of confinement through condensation of such monopoles are
summarized and compared with numerical data.
