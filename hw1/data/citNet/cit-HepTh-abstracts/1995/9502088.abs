The total twist number, which represents the first non-trivial Vassiliev knot
invariant, is derived from the second order expression of the Wilson loop
expectation value in the Chern-Simons theory. Using the well-known fact that
the analytical expression is an invariant, a non-recursive formulation of the
total twist based on the evaluation of knot diagrams is constructed by an
appropriate deformation of the knot line in the three-dimensional Euclidian
space. The relation to the original definition of the total twist is
elucidated.
