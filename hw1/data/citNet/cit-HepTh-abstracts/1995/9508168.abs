Title: Field Theory of the Electron Spin and Zitterbewegung
Authors: Erasmo Recami, Giovanni Salesi
\\
  In a recent paper, we have investigated the classical theory of Barut and
Zanghi (BZ) for the electron spin [which interpreted the Zitterbewegung (zbw)
motion as an internal motion along helical paths], and its ``quantum'' version,
just by using thelanguage of Clifford algebras. And, in so doing, we have ended
with a new non-linear Dirac--like equation (NDE). We want to readdress here the
whole subject, and extend it, by translating it however into the ordinary
tensorial language, within the frame of a first quantization formalism. In
particular, we re-derive here the NDE for the electron field, and show it to be
associated with a new conserved probability current (which allows us to work
out a ``quantum probabilistic" interpretation of our NDE). Actually, we propose
this equation in substitution for the Dirac equation, which is obtained from
the former by averaging over a zbw cycle. We then derive a new equation of
motion for the 4-velocity field which will allow us to regard the electron as
an extended--type object with a classically intelligible internal structure.We
carefully study the solutions of the NDE; with special attention to those
implying (at the classical limit) light-like helical motions, since they appear
to be the most adequate solutions for the electron description from a
kinematical and physical point of view, and do cope with the electromagnetic
properties of the electron. At last we propose a natural generalization of our
approach, for the case in which an external electromagnetic potential $A^\mu$
is present; \ it happens to be based on a new system of {\em five} first--order
differential field equations.
