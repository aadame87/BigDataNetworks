  Physical mass spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions
are evaluated in the light-cone gauge with a compact spatial dimension. The
supercharges are constructed and the infrared regularization is unambiguously
prescribed for supercharges, instead of the light-cone Hamiltonian. This
provides a manifestly supersymmetric infrared regularization for the
discretized light-cone approach. By an exact diagonalization of the supercharge
matrix between up to several hundred color singlet bound states, we find a
rapidly increasing density of states as mass increases.
