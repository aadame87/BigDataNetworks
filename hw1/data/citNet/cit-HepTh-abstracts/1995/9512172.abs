  The four-point Green's function of static QED, where a fermion and an
antifermion are located at fixed space positions, is calculated in covariant
gauges. The bound state spectrum does not display any abnormal state
corresponding to excitations of the relative time. The equation that was
established by Mugibayashi in this model and which has abnormal solutions does
not coincide with the Bethe$-$Salpeter equation. Gauge transformation from the
Coulomb gauge also confirms the absence of abnormal solutions in the
Bethe$-$Salpeter equation.
