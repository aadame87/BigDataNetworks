  A model-independent formulation of anyons as spinning particles is presented.
The general properties of the classical theory of (2+1)-dimensional
relativistic fractional spin particles and some properties of their quantum
theory are investigated. The relationship between all the known approaches to
anyons as spinning particles is established. Some widespread misleading notions
on the general properties of (2+1)-dimensional anyons are removed.
