Title: A geometric formulation of strong interaction
Author: Vu B Ho
Comments: Latex, 5 pages

  It is observed that, at short range, the field equations of general
relativity admit a line element that takes the form of Yukawa potential. The
result leads to the possibility that strong interaction may also be described
by field equations that have the same form as that of general relativity. It is
then shown how such field equations may arise from the coupling of two strong
fields.
