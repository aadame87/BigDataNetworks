We derive the $t{\bar t}$-equations for generic $N\!=\!2$ topological field
theories as consistency conditions for the contact term algebra of topological
strings. A generalization of the holomorphic anomaly equation, known for the
critical ${\hat c}\!=\!3$ case, to arbitrary non critical topological strings
is presented. The interplay between the non trivial cohomology of the
$b$-antighost, gravitational descendants and $\bar t$-dependence is discussed.
The physical picture emerging from this study is that the $\bar t$ (background)
dependence of topological strings with non trivial cohomology for the
$b$-antighost, is determined by gravitational descendants.
