  The stochastic quantization of the fermion field is performed starting from
Dirac equations. The statistical properties of stochastic terms in Langevin
equations are described by explicit formulae of a Markov process. The
interaction of the field is introduced as correlation of the stochastic terms.
In the long time limit free fermions disappear and proper combinations of field
components propagate as a scalar boson field. The existence and uniqueness of
the long time limit is proved in the first order approximation of stochastic
Liouville equation.
