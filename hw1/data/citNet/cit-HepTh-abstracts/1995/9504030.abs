  We obtain the conserved, nonlocal charges for the supersymmetric two boson
hierarchy from fractional powers of its Lax operator. We show that these
charges reduce to the ones of the supersymmetric KdV system under appropriate
reduction. We study the algebra of the nonlocal, local and supersymmetry
charges with respect to the first and the second Hamiltonian structures of the
system and discuss how they close as a graded nonlinear cubic algebra.
