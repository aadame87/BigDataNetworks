Title: Modular Covariance, PCT, Spin and Statistics
Authors: Daniele Guido (U. Roma Tor Vergata)
Comments: 15 pages, plain TeX, talk presented to the Colloquium "New Problems
  in the General Theory of Fields and Particles", Paris 1994. To appear in the
  special issue of the Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e devoted to the Colloquium
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Functional Analysis
Journal-ref: Annales Poincare Phys.Theor. 63 (1995) 383-398
\\
  The notion of modular covariance is reviewed and the reconstruction of the
Poincar\'e group extended to the low-dimensional case. The relations with the
PCT symmetry and the Spin and Statistics theorem are described.
