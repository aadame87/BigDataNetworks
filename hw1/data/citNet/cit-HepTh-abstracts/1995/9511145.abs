  Let $B_{\mu \nu }^a$ ($a=1,...,N$) be a system of $N$ free two-form gauge
fields, with field strengths $H_{\mu \nu \rho }^a = 3 \partial _{[\mu }B_{\nu
\rho ]}^a$ and free action $S_0$ equal to $(-1/12)\int d^nx\ g_{ab}H_{\mu \nu
\rho }^aH^{b\mu \nu \rho }$ ($n\geq 4$). It is shown that in $n>4$ dimensions,
the only consistent local interactions that can be added to the free action are
given by functions of the field strength components and their derivatives (and
the Chern-Simons forms in $5$ mod $3$ dimensions). These interactions do not
modify the gauge invariance $B_{\mu \nu }^a\rightarrow B_{\mu \nu }^a+\partial
_{[\mu }\Lambda _{\nu ]}$ of the free theory. By contrast, there exist in $n=4$
dimensions consistent interactions that deform the gauge symmetry of the free
theory in a non trivial way. These consistent interactions are uniquely given
by the well-known Freedman-Townsend vertex. The method of proof uses the
cohomological techniques developed recently in the Yang-Mills context to
establish theorems on the structure of renormalized gauge-invariant operators.
