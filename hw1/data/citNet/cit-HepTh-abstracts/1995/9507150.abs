  Recently Connes has proposed a new geometric version of the standard model
including a non-commutative charge conjugation. We present a systematic
analysis of the relations among masses and coupling constants in this approach.
In particular, for a given top mass, the Higgs mass is constrained to lie in an
interval. Therefore this constraint is locally stable under renormalization
flow.
