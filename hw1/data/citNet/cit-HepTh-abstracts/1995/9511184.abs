  We show that the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation and the related Lax pair in
1+1 dimensions can be derived from 2+1 dimensional Chern-Simons Topological
Gauge Theory. The spectral parameter, a main object for the Loop algebra
structure and the Inverse Spectral Transform, has appear as a homogeneous part
(condensate) of the statistical gauge field, connected with the compactified
extra space coordinate. In terms of solitons, a natural interpretation for the
one-dimensional analog of Chern-Simons Gauss law is given.
