  We present a new form of Quantum Electrodynamics where the photons are
composites made out of zero-dimensional scalar ``primitives''. The r\^{o}le of
the local gauge symmetry is taken over by an {\em infinite-dimensional global
Noether symmetry} -- the group of volume-preserving (symplectic)
diffeomorphisms of the target space of the scalar primitives. Similar
construction is carried out for higher antisymmetric tensor gauge theories.
Solutions of Maxwell's equations are automatically solutions of the new system.
However, the latter possesses additional non-Maxwell solutions which display
some interesting new effects: (a) a magneto-hydrodynamical analogy, (b) absence
of electromagnetic self-energy for electron plane wave solutions, and (c) gauge
invariant photon mass generation, where the generated mass is arbitrary.
