  In this letter we study supersymmetric sigma models on toric varieties. These
manifolds are generalizations of CP^n manifolds. We examine here sigma models,
viewed as gauged linear sigma models, on one of the simplest such manifold, the
blow-up of P^2_(2,1,1), and determine their properties using the techniques of
topological- antitopological fusion. We find that the model contains solitons
which become massless at the singular point of the theory where a gauge
symmetry remains unbroken.
