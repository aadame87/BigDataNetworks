  Recently we have shown that a phase transition occurs in the leading and
sub-leading approximation of the large N limit in rigid strings coupled to long
range Kalb-Ramond interactions. The disordered phase is essentially the
Nambu-Goto-Polyakov string theory while the ordered phase is a new theory. In
this letter we compute the free energy per unit length of the interacting rigid
string at finite temperature. We show that the mass of the winding states
solves that of QCD strings in the limit of high temperature. We obtain a
precise identification of the QCD coupling constant and those of the
interacting rigid string. The relation we obtain is
$Ng_{QCD}^2=({4\pi^2(D-2)\over 3})^2{1\over 3\kappa}$ where
$\kappa={Dt\alpha\over\pi\mu_{c}}$ is the ratio of the extrinsic curvature
coupling constant t, the Kalb-Ramond coupling constant $\alpha$, and the
critical string tension $\mu_{c}$. The running beta function of $\kappa$
reproduces correctly the asymptotic behaviour of QCD.
