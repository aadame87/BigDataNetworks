Title: Total Divergences in Hamiltonian Formalism of Field Theory
Author: Vladimir O. Soloviev
Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX, no figures
Report-no: Talk given at Protvino Workhop (June, 1994)
\\
  In this report it is proposed to generalize the definition of Poisson
brackets in order to treat spatial integrals of divergences as Hamiltonians
which generate a kind of Hamiltonian equations on the boundary. Nonlinear
Schrodinger equation is used as an illustrative example.
