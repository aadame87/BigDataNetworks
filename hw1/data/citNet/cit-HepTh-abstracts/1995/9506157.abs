  Integrability and supersymmetry of the supersymmetric extension of the
sine-Gordon theory on a half-line are examined and the boundary potential which
preserves both the integrability and supersymmetry on the bulk is derived. It
appears that unlike the boundary bosonic sine-Gordon theory, integrability and
supersymmetry strongly restrict the form and parameters of the boundary
potential, so that no free parameter in the boundary term is allowed up to a
choice of signs.
