  The most general electrically and magnetically charged rotating black hole
solutions of 5 dimensional \KK\ theory are given in an explicit form. Various
classical quantities associated with the black holes are derived. In
particular, one finds the very surprising result that the gyromagnetic and
gyroelectric ratios can become {\tenit arbitrarily large}. The thermodynamic
quantities of the black holes are calculated and a Smarr-type formula is
obtained leading to a generalized first law of black hole thermodynamics. The
properties of the extreme solutions are investigated and it is shown how they
naturally separate into two classes. The extreme solutions in one class are
found to have two unusual properties: (i). Their event horizons have zero
angular velocity and yet they have non-zero ADM angular momentum. (ii). In
certain circumstances it is possible to add angular momentum to these extreme
solutions without changing the mass or charges and yet still maintain an
extreme solution. Regarding the extreme black holes as elementary particles,
their stability is discussed and it is found that they are stable provided they
have sufficient angular momentum.
