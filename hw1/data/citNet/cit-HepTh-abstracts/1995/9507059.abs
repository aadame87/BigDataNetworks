  We give a class of explicit solutions for the stationary and cylindrically
symmetric vortex configurations for a ``cool'' two-component superfluid (i.e.
superfluid with an ideal gas of phonons). Each solution is characterized only
by a set of (true) constants of integration. We then compute the effective
asymptotic contribution of the vortex to the stress energy tensor by comparison
with a uniform reference state without vortex.
