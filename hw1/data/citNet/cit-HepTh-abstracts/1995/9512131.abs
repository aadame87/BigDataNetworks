  At the very early Universe the matter fields are described by the GUT models
in curved space-time. At high energies these fields are asymptotically free and
conformally coupled to external metric. The only possible quantum effect is the
appearance of the conformal anomaly, which leads to the propagation of the new
degree of freedom - conformal factor. Simultaneously with the expansion of the
Universe, the scale of energies decreases and the propagating conformal factor
starts to interact with the Higgs field due to the violation of conformal
invariance in the matter fields sector. In a previous paper \cite{foo} we have
shown that this interaction can lead to special physical effects like the
renormalization group flow, which ends in some fixed point. Furthermore in the
vicinity of this fixed point there occur the first order phase transitions. In
the present paper we consider the same theory of conformal factor coupled to
Higgs field and incorporate the temperature effects. We reduce the complicated
higher-derivative operator to several ones of the standard second-derivative
form and calculate an exact effective potential with temperature on the anti de
Sitter (AdS) background.
