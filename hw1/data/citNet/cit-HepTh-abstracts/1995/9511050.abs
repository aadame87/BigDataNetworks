  We review some aspects of gauged WZW models. By choosing a nilpotent subgroup
as gauge group, one is lead to three main applications: the construction of
field theories with an extended conformal symmetry, the construction of the
effective action of (extended) 2D gravities and the systematic construction of
string theories with some extended gauge symmetry.
