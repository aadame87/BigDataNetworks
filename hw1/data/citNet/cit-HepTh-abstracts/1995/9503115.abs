We relate the non-perturbative exact results in supersymmetry to perturbation
theory using several different methods: instanton calculations at weak or
strong coupling, a method using gaugino condensation and another method
relating strong and weak coupling. This allows many precise numerical checks of
the consistency of these methods, especially the amplitude of instanton
effects, and of the network of exact solutions in supersymmetry. However, there
remain difficulties with the instanton computations at strong coupling.
