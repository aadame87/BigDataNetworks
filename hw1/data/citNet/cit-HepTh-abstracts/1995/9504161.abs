  Four dimensional heterotic string effective action is known to admit
non-rotating electrically and magnetically charged black hole solutions. It is
shown that the partition functions and entropies in both the cases are
identical when these black hole solutions are related by S-duality
transformations. The entropy is computed and is vanishing for each black hole
in the extremal limit.
