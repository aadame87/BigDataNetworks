The Hamilton-Jacobi formalism generalized to 2-dimensional field theories
according to Lepage's canonical framework is applied to several relativistic
real scalar fields, e.g. massless and massive Klein-Gordon, Sinh and
Sine-Gordon, Liouville and $\phi^4$ theories. The relations between the
Euler-Lagrange and the Hamilton-Jacobi equations are discussed in DeDonder and
Weyl's and the corresponding wave fronts are calculated in Carath\'eodory's
formulation. Unlike mechanics we have to impose certain integrability
conditions on the velocity fields to guarantee the transversality relations and
especially the dynamical equivalence between Hamilton-Jacobi wave fronts and
families of extremals embedded therein. B\"acklund Transformations play a
crucial role in solving the resulting system of coupled nonlinear PDEs.
