  The first quantum corrections to the entropy for an eternal 4-dimensional
extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is investigated at one-loop level, in
the large mass limit of the black hole, making use of the conformal techniques
related to the optical metric. A leading cubic horizon divergence is found and
other divergences appear due to the singular nature of the optical manifold.
The area law is shown to be violated.
