  A general method is presented which allows one to determine from the local
gauge invariant observables of a quantum field theory the underlying particle
and symmetry structures appearing at the lower (ultraviolet) end of the
spatio--temporal scale. Particles which are confined to small scales, i.e., do
not appear in the physical spectrum, can be uncovered in this way without
taking recourse to gauge fields or indefinite metric spaces. In this way
notions such as quark, gluon, colour symmetry and confinement acquire a new and
intrinsic meaning which is stable under gauge or duality transformations. The
method is illustrated by the example of the Schwinger model.
