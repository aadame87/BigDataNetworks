Title: Quantum Chains of Hopf Algebras with Quantum Double Cosymmetry
Authors: Florian Nill and Kornel Szlachanyi
Comments: Latex, 48 pages, no figures, extended version of hep-th/9507174, but
  without the field algebra construction, contains full proofs of the slightly
  shortened article published in Commun.Math.Phys., the revision only concerns
  some misprints and an update of the literature

  Given a finite dimensional C^*-Hopf algebra H and its dual H^ we construct
the infinite crossed product A=... x H x H^ x H ... and study its
superselection sectors in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory. A is
the observable algebra of a generalized quantum spin chain with H-order and
H^-disorder symmetries, where by a duality transformation the role of order and
disorder may also appear interchanged. If H=\CC G is a group algebra then A
becomes an ordinary G-spin model. We classify all DHR-sectors of A --- relative
to some Haag dual vacuum representation --- and prove that their symmetry is
described by the Drinfeld double D(H). To achieve this we construct localized
coactions \rho: A \to (A \otimes D(H)) and use a certain compressibility
property to prove that they are universal amplimorphisms on A. In this way the
double D(H) can be recovered from the observable algebra A as a universal
cosymmetrty.
