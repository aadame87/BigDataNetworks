  We study the conditions under which a symmetry is spontaneously broken in the
Wilson renormalization group formulation. Both for a global and local symmetry,
the result is that in perturbation theory one has to perform a fine tuning of
the boundary conditions for the flow of the relevant couplings. We consider in
detail the discrete $Z_2$ case and the Abelian Higgs model.
