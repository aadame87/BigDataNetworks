  We present a theorem describing a dual relation between the local geometry of
a space admitting a symmetric second-rank Killing tensor, and the local
geometry of a space with a metric specified by this Killing tensor. The
relation can be generalized to spinning spaces, but only at the expense of
introducing torsion. This introduces new supersymmetries in their geometry.
Interesting examples in four dimensions include the Kerr-Newman metric of
spinning black-holes and self-dual Taub-NUT.
