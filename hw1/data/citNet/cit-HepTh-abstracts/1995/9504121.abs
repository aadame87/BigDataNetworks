  In this paper we construct a $(2,2)$ dimensional string theory with manifest
$N=1$ spacetime supersymmetry. We use Berkovits' approach of augmenting the
spacetime supercoordinates by the conjugate momenta for the fermionic
variables. The worldsheet symmetry algebra is a twisted and truncated ``small''
$N=4$ superconformal algebra. The realisation of the symmetry algebra is
reducible with an infinite order of reducibility. We study the physical states
of the theory by two different methods. In one of them, we identify a subset of
irreducible constraints, which is by itself critical. We construct the BRST
operator for the irreducible constraints, and study the cohomology and
interactions. This method breaks the $SO(2,2)$ spacetime symmetry of the
original reducible theory. In another approach, we study the theory in a fully
covariant manner, which involves the introduction of infinitely many ghosts for
ghosts.
