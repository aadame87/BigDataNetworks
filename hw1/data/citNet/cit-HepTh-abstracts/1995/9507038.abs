  We complete the proof of the ghost-dilaton theorem in string theory by
showing that the coupling constant dependence of the vacuum vertices appearing
in the closed string action is given correctly by one-point functions of the
ghost-dilaton. To prove this at genus one we develop the formalism required to
evaluate off-shell amplitudes on tori.
