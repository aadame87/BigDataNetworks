  Dirichlet-branes have emerged as important objects in studying
nonperturbative string theory. It is important to generalize these objects to
more general backgrounds other than the usual flat background. The simplest
case is the linear dilaton condensate. The usual Dirichlet boundary condition
violates conformal invariance in such a background. We show that by switching
on a certain boundary interaction, conformal invariance is restored. An
immediate application of this result is to two dimensional string theory.
