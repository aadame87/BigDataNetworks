  The QED(0+1) model describing a quantum mechanical particle on a circle with
minimal electromagnetic interaction and with a potential -M cos(phi - theta_M),
which mimics the massive Schwinger model, is discussed as a prototype of
mechanisms and infrared structures of gauge quantum field theories in positive
gauges. The functional integral representation displays a complex measure, with
a crucial role of the boundary conditions, and the decomposition into theta
sectors takes place already in finite volume. In the infinite volume limit, the
standard results are reproduced for M=0 (massless fermions), but one meets
substantial differences for M not = 0: for generic boundary conditions,
independently of the lagrangean angle of the topological term, the infinite
volume limit selects the sector with theta = theta_M, and provides a natural
"dynamical" solution of the strong CP problem. In comparison with previous
approaches, the strategy discussed here allows to exploit the consequences of
the theta-dependence of the free energy density, with a unique minimum at theta
= theta_M.
