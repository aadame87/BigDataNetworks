  We discuss the limitations on space time measurement in the Schwarzchild
metric. We find that near the horizon the limitations on space time measurement
are of the order of the black hole radius. We suggest that it indicates that a
large mass black hole cannot be described by means of local field theory even
at macroscopic distances and that any attempt to describe black hole formation
and evaporation by means of an effective local field theory will necessarily
lead to information loss. We also present a new interpretation of the black
hole entropy which leads to $S=cA$ , where $c$ is a constant of order $1$ which
does not depend on the number of fields.
