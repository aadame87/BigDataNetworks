  The crystalline spinon basis for the RSOS models associated with
$\widehat{sl_2}$ is studied. This basis gives fermionic type character formulas
for the branching coefficients of the coset $(\widehat{sl_2})_l \times
(\widehat{sl_2})_N/(\widehat{sl_2})_{l+N}$. In addition the path description of
the parafermion characters is found as a limit of the spinon description of the
string functions.
