Title: Fock-Bargman Representation of the Distorted Heisenberg Algebra
Authors: J. Oscar Rosas-Ortiz
Comments: 10 pages, Latex, 0 figures. Minor revisions and changes in the above
  version. A new number operator $N_w$ which dependence as a function of the
  Hamiltonian $H{_\lambda}$ has been discussed. Submitted to J. Phys. A: Math.
  Gen. 1996

  The dynamical algebra associated to a family of Isospectral Oscillator
Hamiltonians, named {\it Distorted Heisenberg Algebra} because its dependence
on a distortion parameter $W \geq 0$, has been recently studied. The connection
of this algebra with the Hilbert space of entire functions of growth (1/2, 2)
is analized.
