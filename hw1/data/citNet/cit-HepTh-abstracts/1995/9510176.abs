  A recently proposed variation on the usual procedure to perform the
topological B-twist in rigid $N=2$ models is applied to the case of the $\sigma
$ model on a K\"ahler manifold. This leads to an alternative description of
Witten's topological $\sigma $ model, which allows for a proper BRST
interpretation and ghost number assignement. We also show that the auxiliary
fields, which are responsible for the off shell closure of the $N=2$ algebra,
play an important role in our construction.
