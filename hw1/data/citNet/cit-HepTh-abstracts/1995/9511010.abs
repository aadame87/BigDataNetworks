  The general four parameter point interaction in one dimensional quantum
mechanics is regulated. It allows the exact solution, but not the perturbative
one. We conjecture that this is due to the interaction not being asymptotically
free. We then propose a different breakup of unperturbed theory and
interaction, which now is asymptotically free but leads to the same physics.
The corresponding regulated potential can be solved both exactly and
perturbatively, in agreement with the conjecture.
