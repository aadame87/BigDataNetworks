  We construct a transformation that transforms perturbative states into states
that implement Gauss's law for `pure gluonic' Yang-Mills theory and QCD. The
fact that this transformation is not and cannot be unitary has special
significance. Previous work has shown that only states that are unitarily
equivalent to perturbative states necessarily give the same S-matrix elements
as are obtained with Feynman rules.
