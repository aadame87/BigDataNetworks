  A study is made of the implications of heterotic string $T$-duality and
extended gauge symmetry for the conjectured equivalence of heterotic and Type I
superstrings. While at first sight heterotic string world-sheet dynamics
appears to conflict with Type I perturbation theory, a closer look shows that
Type I perturbation theory ``miraculously'' breaks down, in some cases via
novel mechanisms, whenever the heterotic string has massless particles not
present in Type I perturbation theory. This strongly suggests that the two
theories actually are equivalent. As further evidence in the same direction, we
show that the Dirichlet one-brane of type I string theory has the same
world-sheet structure as the heterotic string.
