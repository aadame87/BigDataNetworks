We show that QCD$_2$ on 2D pseudo-manifolds is consistent with the Gross-Taylor
string picture. It allows us to introduce a model describing the
one-dimensional evolution of the QCD$_2$ string (in the sense that QCD$_2$
itself is regarded as a zero-dimensional system). The model is shown to possess
the third order phase transition associated with the $c=1$ Bose string below
which it becomes equivalent to the vortex-free sector of the 1-dimensional
matrix model. We argue that it could serve as a toy model for the
glueball-threshold behavior of multicolor QCD.
