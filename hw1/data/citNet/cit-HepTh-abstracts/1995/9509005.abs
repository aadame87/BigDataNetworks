  The DeWitt expansion of the matrix element $M_{xy} = \left\langle x \right|
\exp -[\case{1}{2} (p-A)^2 + V]t \left| y \right\rangle$, $(p=-i\partial)$ in
powers of $t$ can be made in a number of ways. For $x=y$ (the case of interest
when doing one-loop calculations) numerous approaches have been employed to
determine this expansion to very high order; when $x \neq y$ (relevant for
doing calculations beyond one-loop) there appear to be but two examples of
performing the DeWitt expansion. In this paper we compute the off-diagonal
elements of the DeWitt expansion coefficients using the Fock-Schwinger gauge.
Our technique is based on representing $M_{xy}$ by a quantum mechanical path
integral. We also generalize our method to the case of curved space, allowing
us to determine the DeWitt expansion of $\tilde M_{xy} = \langle x| \exp
\case{1}{2} [\case{1}{\sqrt {g}} (\partial_\mu - i
A_\mu)g^{\mu\nu}{\sqrt{g}}(\partial_\nu - i A_\nu) ] t| y \rangle$ by use of
normal coordinates. By comparison with results for the DeWitt expansion of this
matrix element obtained by the iterative solution of the diffusion equation,
the relative merit of different approaches to the representation of $\tilde
M_{xy}$ as a quantum mechanical path integral can be assessed. Furthermore, the
exact dependence of $\tilde M_{xy}$ on some geometric scalars can be
determined. In two appendices, we discuss boundary effects in the
one-dimensional quantum mechanical path integral, and the curved space
generalization of the Fock-Schwinger gauge.
