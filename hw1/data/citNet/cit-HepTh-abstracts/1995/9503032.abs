The perturbation theory expansion of the Aharonov-Bohm scattering amplitude has
previously been studied in the context of quantum mechanics for spin zero and
spin-1/2 particles as well in Galilean covariant field theory. This problem is
reconsidered in the framework of the model in which the flux line is considered
to have a finite radius which is shrunk to zero at the end of the calculation.
General agreement with earlier results is obtained but with the advantage of a
treatment which unifies all the various subcases.
