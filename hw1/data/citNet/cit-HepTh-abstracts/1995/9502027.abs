We study the Wess-Zumino theory on ${\bf R}^3 \times S^1$ where a spatial
coordinate is compactified. We show that when the bosonic and fermionic fields
satisfy the same boundary condition, the theory does not develop a vacuum
energy or tadpoles. We work out the two point functions at one loop and show
that their forms are consistent with the nonrenormalization theorem. However,
the two point functions are nonanalytic and we discuss the structure of this
nonanalyticity.
