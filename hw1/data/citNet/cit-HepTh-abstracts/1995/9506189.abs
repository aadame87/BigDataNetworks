  We develop exact field theoretic methods to treat turbulence when the effect
of pressure is negligible. We find explicit forms of certain probability
distributions, demonstrate that the breakdown of Galilean invariance is
responsible for intermittency and establish the operator product expansion. We
also indicate how the effects of pressure can be turned on perturbatively.
