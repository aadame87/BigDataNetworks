We explicitly show that the net number of degrees of freedom in the
two-dimensional dilaton gravity is zero through the Hamiltonian constraint
analysis. This implies that the local space-time dependent physical excitations
do not exist. From the linear perturbation around the black hole background, we
explicitly prove that the exponentially growing mode with time is in fact
eliminated outside the horizon. Therefore, the two-dimensional dilation gravity
is essentially stable.
