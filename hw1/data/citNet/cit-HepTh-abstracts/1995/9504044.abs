  Rigid QED is a renormalizable generalization of Feynman's space-time action
characterized by the addition of the curvature of the world line (rigidity). We
have recently shown that a phase transition occurs in the leading approximation
of the large N limit. The disordered phase essentially coincides with ordinary
QED, while the ordered phase is a new theory. We have further shown that both
phases of the quantum theory are free of ghosts and tachyons. In this letter,
we study the first sub-leading quantum corrections leading to the renormalized
mass gap equation. Our main result is that the phase transition does indeed
survive these quantum fluctuations.
