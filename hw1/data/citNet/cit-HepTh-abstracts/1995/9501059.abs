Title: Counting the local fields in SG theory.
Author: F.A. Smirnov
Comments: 16 pages AMSTEX References to the papers by A. Koubek and G. Mussargo
  are added. In view of them the stasus of the problem with scalar S-matrices
  is reconsidered.
Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B453 (1995) 807-824
\\
In terms of the form factor bootstrap we describe all the local fields in SG
theory and check the agreement with the free fermion case. We discuss the
interesting structure responsible for counting the local fields.
