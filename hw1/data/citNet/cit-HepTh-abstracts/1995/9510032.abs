  Using the representation of the quantum group $SL_q$(2) by the Weyl
ope\-ra\-tors of the canonical commutation relations in quantum mechanics, we
construct and solve a new vertex model on a square lattice. Random variables on
horizontal bonds are Ising variables, and those on the vertical bonds take half
positive integer values. The vertices is subjected to a genera\-li\-zed form of
the so-called ``ice-rule'', its property are studied in details and its free
energy calculated with the method of quantum inverse scattering. Remarkably in
analogy with the usual six-vertex model, there exists a ``Free-Fermion'' limit
with a novel rich operator structure. The existing algebraic structure suggests
a possible connection with a lattice neutral plasma of charges, via the
Fermion-Boson correspondence.
