  Global issues of the Poisson-Lie T-duality are addressed. It is shown that
oriented open strings propagating on a group manifold $G$ are dual to $D$-brane
- anti-$D$-brane pairs propagating on the dual group manifold $\ti G$. The
$D$-branes coincide with the symplectic leaves of the standard Poisson
structure induced on the dual group $\ti G$ by the dressing action of the group
$G$. T-duality maps the momentum of the open string into the mutual distance of
the $D$-branes in the pair. The whole picture is then extended to the full
modular space $M(D)$ of the Poisson-Lie equivalent $\si$-models which is the
space of all Manin triples of a given Drinfeld double.T-duality rotates the
zero modes of pairs of $D$-branes living on targets belonging to $M(D)$. In
this more general case the $D$-branes are preimages of symplectic leaves in
certain Poisson homogeneous spaces of their targets and, as such, they are
either all even or all odd dimensional.
