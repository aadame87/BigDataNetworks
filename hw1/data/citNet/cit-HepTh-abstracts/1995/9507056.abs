  The Hamiltonian derived by Bartels, Kwiecinski and Praszalowicz for the study
of high-energy QCD in the generalized logarithmic approximation was found to
correspond to the Hamiltonian of an integrable $XXX$ spin chain. We study the
odderon Hamiltonian corresponding to three sites by means of the Bethe Ansatz
approach. We rewrite the Baxter equation, and consequently the Bethe Ansatz
equations, as a linear triangular system. We derive a new expression for the
eigenvectors and the eigenvalues, and discuss the quantization of the conserved
quantities.
