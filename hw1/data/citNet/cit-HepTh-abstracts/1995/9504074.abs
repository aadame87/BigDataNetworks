  In this note we review the spinon basis for the integrable highest weight
modules of sl2^ at levels k\geq1, and give the corresponding character formula.
We show that our spinon basis is intimately related to the basis proposed by
Foda et al. in the principal gradation of the algebra. This gives rise to new
identities for the q-dimensions of the integrable modules.
