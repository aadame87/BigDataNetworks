  Area preserving diffeomorphisms of a 2-d compact Riemannian manifold with or
without boundary are studied. We find two classes of decompositions of a
Riemannian metric, namely, h- and g-decomposition, that help to formulate a
gravitational theory which is area preserving diffeomorphism (SDiff$M$-)
invariant but not necessarily diffeomorphism invariant. The general covariance
of equations of motion of such a theory can be achieved by incorporating proper
Weyl rescaling. The h-decomposition makes the conformal factor of a metric
SDiff$M$-invariant and the rest of the metric invariant under conformal
diffeomorphisms, whilst the g-decomposition makes the conformal factor a
SDiff$M$ scalar and the rest a SDiff$M$ tensor. Using these, we reformulate
Liouville gravity in SDiff$M$ invariant way. In this context we also further
clarify the dual formulation of Liouville gravity introduced by the author
before, in which the affine spin connection is dual to the Liouville field.
