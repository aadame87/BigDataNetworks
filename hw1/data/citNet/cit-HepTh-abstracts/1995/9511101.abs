Title: Variational Solution of the Gross-Neveu Model: finite $N$ and
  Renormalization
Authors: C. Arvanitis, F. Geniet, M. Iacomi, J.-L. Kneur and A. Neveu
Comments: 35 pages, Latex, 5 figures. Correction of a trivial mistake in the
  Pad\'e approximant numerical program leads to a significant improvement of
  the variational results for the mass gap, for arbitrary N. A more complete
  comparison of different Pad\'e approximants is performed. Text modified
  according to these new results, one figure and two references added

  We show how to perform systematically improvable variational calculations in
the $O(2N)$ Gross-Neveu model for generic $N$, in such a way that all
infinities usually plaguing such calculations are accounted for in a way
compatible with the perturbative renormalization group . The final point is a
general framework for the calculation of non-perturbative quantities like
condensates, masses etc$\ldots$, in an asymptotically free field theory. For
the Gross-Neveu model, the numerical results obtained from a ``2-loop'' down to
low values of $N$.
