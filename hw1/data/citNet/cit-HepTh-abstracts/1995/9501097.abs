  In this paper we extend our previously discovered exact solution for an SU(2)
gauge theory coupled to a massless, non-interacting scalar field, to the
general group SU(N+1). Using the first-order formalism of Bogomolny, an exact,
spherically symmetric solution for the gauge and scalar fields is found. This
solution is similiar to the Schwarzschild solution of general relativity, in
that the gauge and scalar fields become infinite at a radius, $r_0 = K$, from
the origin. It is speculated that this may be the confinement mechanism that
has long been sought for in non-Abelian gauge theories, since any particle
which carries the SU(N+1) charge would become permanently trapped once it
entered the region $r < r_0$. The energy of the field configuration of this
solution is calculated.
