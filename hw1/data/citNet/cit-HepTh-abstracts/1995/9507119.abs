  We show that the kinetic approach to statistical mechanics permits an elegant
and efficient treatment of fractional exclusion statistics. By using the
exclusion-inclusion principle recently proposed [Phys. Rev. E49, 5103 (1994)]
as a generalization of the Pauli exclusion principle, which is based on a
proper definition of the transition probability between two states, we derive a
variety of different statistical distributions interpolating between bosons and
fermions. The Haldane exclusion principle and the Haldane-Wu fractional
exclusion statistics are obtained in a natural way as particular cases. The
thermodynamic properties of the statistical systems obeying the generalized
exclusion-inclusion principle are discussed.
