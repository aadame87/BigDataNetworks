  We suggest that some of the remarkable results on stringy dynamics which have
been found recently indicate the existence of another dynamical length scale in
string theory that, at weak coupling, is much shorter than the string scale.
This additional scale corresponds to a mass $\sim m_{\rm s}/g_{\rm s}$ where
$m_{\rm s}$ is the square root of the string tension and $g_{\rm s}$ is the
string coupling constant. In four dimensions this coincides with the Planck
mass.
