The method of the calculation of the multi-loop superstring amplitudes is
proposed. The amplitudes are calculated from the equations that are none other
than Ward identities. They are derived from the requirement that the discussed
amplitudes are independent from a choice of gauge of both the vierbein and the
gravitino field. The amplitudes are calculated in the terms of the superfields
vacuum correlators on the complex (1|1) supermanifolds. The superconformal
Schottky groups appropriate for this aim are built for all the spinor
structures. The calculation of the multi- loop boson emission amplitudes in the
closed, oriented Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz superstring theory is discussed in
details. The main problem arises for those spinor structures that correspond to
the Ramond fermion loops. Indeed, in this case the superfield vacuum
correlators can not be derived by a simple extension of the boson string
results. The method of the calculation of the above correlators is proposed.
The discussed amplitudes due to all the even spinor structures is given in the
explicit form.
