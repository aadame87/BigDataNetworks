  In this note we show that the single soliton solutions known previously in
the $1+1$ dimensional affine Toda field theories from a variety of different
methods \cite{H1,MM,OTUa,OTUb}, are in fact not the most general single soliton
solutions. We exhibit single soliton solutions with additional small parameters
which reduce to the previously known solutions when these extra parameters are
set to zero. The new solution has the same mass and topological charges as the
standard solution when these parameters are set to zero. However we cannot yet
completely rule out the possibility that other solutions with larger values of
these extra parameters are non-singular, in the cases where the number of extra
parameters is greater than one, and if so their topological charges would most
likely be different.
