  We present a version of ten-dimensional IIA supergravity containing a 9-form
potential for which the field equations are equivalent to those of the
standard, massless, IIA theory for vanishing 10-form field strength, $F_{10}$,
and to those of the `massive' IIA theory for non-vanishing $F_{10}$. We exhibit
a multi 8-brane solution of this theory which preserves half the supersymmetry.
We propose this solution as the effective field theory realization of the
Dirichlet 8-brane of type IIA superstring theory.
