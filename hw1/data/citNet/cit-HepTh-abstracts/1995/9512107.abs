  We construct a 1+1 dimensional superstring-bit model for D=3 Type IIB
superstring. This low dimension model escapes the problems encountered in
higher dimension models: (1) It possesses full Galilean supersymmetry; (2) For
noninteracting polymers of bits, the exactly soluble linear superpotential
describing bit interactions is in a large universality class of superpotentials
which includes ones bounded at spatial infinity; (3) The latter are used to
construct a superstring-bit model with the clustering properties needed to
define an $S$-matrix for closed polymers of superstring-bits.
