  We discuss the stability of the extremal ground states of a two-dimensional
(2D) charged black hole which carries both electric ($Q_E$) and magnetic
($Q_M$) charges. The method is first to find the physical field and then to
derive the equation of the Schr\"odinger type. It is found that the presenting
potential to an on-coming tachyon (as a spectator) takes a barrier-well type.
This provides the bound state solution, which implies an exponentially growing
mode with respect to time. The 2D extremal ground states all are classically
unstable. We conclude that the 2D extremal charged black holes are not
considered as the candidates for the stable endpoint of the Hawking
evaporation.
