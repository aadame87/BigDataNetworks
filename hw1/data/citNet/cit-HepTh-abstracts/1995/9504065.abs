  We consider a N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons model, coupled to
matter, in the Wess-Zumino gauge. The theory is characterized by a superalgebra
which displays two kinds of obstructions to the closure on the translations:
field dependent gauge transformations, which give rise to an infinite algebra,
and equations of motion. The aim is to put the formalism in a closed form,
off-shell, without introducing auxiliary fields. In order to perform that, we
collect all the symmetries of the model into a unique nilpotent Slavnov-Taylor
operator. Furthermore, we prove the renormalizability of the model through the
analysis of the cohomology arising from the generalized Slavnov-Taylor
operator. In particular, we show that the model is free of anomaly.
