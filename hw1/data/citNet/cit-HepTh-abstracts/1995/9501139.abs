We suggest a method of bosonizing any D=2 theory. We demonstrate how it works
with the examples of the Thirring and the Schwinger models, known results are
reproduced. This method, being applied to the Gross-Neveu model, yields
nonlinear boson WZW-type theory with additional constraint in the field space.
Relation to the nonlinear sigma - model is also discussed.
