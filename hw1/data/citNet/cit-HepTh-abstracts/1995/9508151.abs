Title: The black hole information paradox
Author: Steven B. Giddings
Comments: 15 pages (harvmac l mode)
Report-no: UCSBTH-95-24
\\
  A concise survey of the black hole information paradox and its current status
is given. A summary is also given of recent arguments against remnants. The
assumptions underlying remnants, namely unitarity and causality, would imply
that Reissner Nordstrom black holes have infinite internal states. These can be
argued to lead to an unacceptable infinite production rate of such black holes
in background fields. (To appear in the proceedings of the PASCOS
symposium/Johns Hopkins Workshop, Baltimore, MD, March 22-25, 1995).
