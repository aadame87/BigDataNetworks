The one--loop determinant computed around the kink solution in the 3D $\phi^4$
theory, in cylindrical geometry, allows one to obtain the partition function of
the interface separating coexisting phases. The quantum fluctuations of the
interface around its equilibrium position are described by a $c=1$
two--dimensional conformal field theory, namely a 2D free massless scalar field
living on the interface. In this way the capillary wave model conjecture for
the interface free energy in its gaussian approximation is proved.
