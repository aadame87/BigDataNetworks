  We prove the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions. The
successful strategy is to keep the volume preserving diffeomorphism as the
manifest symmetry of the theory. The general covariance is recovered by further
imposing the conformal invariance. The proof utilizes BRS formalism in parallel
with Yang-Mills theory. The crucial ingredient of the proof is the relation
between the conformal anomaly and the $\beta$ functions.
