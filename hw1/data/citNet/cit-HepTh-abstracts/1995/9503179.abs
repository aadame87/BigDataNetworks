  We study supersymmetric $SO(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors of quarks
in the vector representation. Among the phenomena we find are dynamically
generated superpotentials with physically inequivalent branches, smooth moduli
spaces of vacua, confinement and oblique confinement, confinement without
chiral symmetry breaking, massless composites (glueballs, exotics, monopoles
and dyons), non-trivial fixed points of the renormalization group and massless
magnetic quarks and gluons. Our analysis sheds new light on a recently found
duality in $N=1$ supersymmetric theories. The dual forms of some of the
theories exhibit ``quantum symmetries'' which involve non-local transformations
on the fields. We find that in some cases the duality has both $S$ and $T$
transformations generating $SL(2,Z)$ (only an $S_3$ quotient of which is
realized non-trivially). They map the original non-Abelian electric theory to
magnetic and dyonic non-Abelian theories. The magnetic theory gives a weak
coupling description of confinement while the dyonic theory gives a weak
coupling description of oblique confinement. Our analysis also shows that the
duality in $N=1$ is a generalization of the Montonen-Olive duality of $N=4$
theories.
