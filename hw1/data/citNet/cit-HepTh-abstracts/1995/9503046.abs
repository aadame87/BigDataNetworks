Title: Galilean invariance in 2+1 dimensions.
Authors: Y.Brihaye,C.Gonera,S.Giller and P.Kosinski.
Comments: 9 pages, latex, no figures
\\
The Galilean invariance in three dimensional space-time is considered. It
appears that the Galilei group in 2+1 dimensions posses a three-parameter
family of projective representations. Their physical interpretation is
discussed in some detail.
