  We continue our analysis of the field strength correlation functions of
two-dimensional QCD on Riemann surfaces by studying the large $N$ limit of
these correlation functions on the sphere for gauge group $U(N)$. Our results
allow us to exhibit an explicit master field for the field strength
$F_{\mu\nu}$ in a ``topological gauge'', given by a single master matrix in the
Lie algebra of the maximal torus of the gauge group. Field correlators are
obtained from traces of products of the master field. We also obtain a master
field for the gauge potential $A_{\mu}$ on the sphere, consistent with the
master field for the field strength.
