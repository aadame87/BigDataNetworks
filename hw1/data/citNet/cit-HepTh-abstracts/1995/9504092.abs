  We study a scalar field theory coupled to gravity on a flat background, below
Planck's energy. Einstein's theory is treated as an effective field theory.
Within the context of Wilson's renormalization group, we compute gravitational
corrections to the beta functions and the anomalous dimension of the scalar
field, taking into account threshold effects.
