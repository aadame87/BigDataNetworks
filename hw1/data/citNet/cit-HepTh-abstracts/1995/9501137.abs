  Scalar field theory at finite temperature is investigated via an improved
renormalization group prescription which provides an effective resummation over
all possible non-overlapping higher loop graphs. Explicit analyses for the
lambda phi^4 theory are performed in d=4 Euclidean space for both low and high
temperature limits. We generate a set of coupled equations for the mass
parameter and the coupling constant from the renormalization group flow
equation. Dimensional reduction and symmetry restoration are also explored with
our improved approach.
