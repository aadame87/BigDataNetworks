Title: Weak quasitriangular Quasi-Hopf algebra structure of minimal models
Author: J. A. Teschner
Comments: 18 pages, amslatex, proof of prop. 6.2 corrected
\\
  The chiral vertex operators for the minimal models are constructed and used
to define a fusion product of representations. The existence of commutativity
and associativity operations is proved. The matrix elements of the
associativity operations are shown to be given in terms of the 6-j symbols of
the weak quasitriangular quasi-Hopf algebra obtained by truncating $\usl$ at
roots of unity.
