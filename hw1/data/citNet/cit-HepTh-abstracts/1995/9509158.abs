  We construct the path integral for one-dimensional non-linear sigma models,
starting from a given Hamiltonian operator and states in a Hilbert space. By
explicit evaluation of the discretized propagators and vertices we find the
correct Feynman rules which differ from those often assumed. These rules, which
we previously derived in bosonic systems \cite{paper1}, are now extended to
fermionic systems. We then generalize the work of Alvarez-Gaum\'e and Witten
\cite{alwi} by developing a framework to compute anomalies of an
$n$-dimensional quantum field theory by evaluating perturbatively a
corresponding quantum mechanical path integral. Finally, we apply this
formalism to various chiral and trace anomalies, and solve a series of
technical problems: $(i)$ the correct treatment of Majorana fermions in path
integrals with coherent states (the methods of fermion doubling and fermion
halving yield equivalent results when used in applications to anomalies),
$(ii)$ a complete path integral treatment of the ghost sector of chiral
Yang-Mills anomalies, $(iii)$ a complete path integral treatment of trace
anomalies, $(iv)$ the supersymmetric extension of the Van Vleck determinant,
and $(v)$ a derivation of the spin-$3\over 2$ Jacobian of Alvarez-Gaum\'{e} and
Witten for Lorentz anomalies.
