  In this paper, a three-dimensional vertex model is obtained. It is a duality
of the three-dimensional integrable lattice model with $N$ states proposed by
Boos, Mangazeev, Sergeev and Stroganov. The Boltzmann weight of the model is
dependent on four spin variables, which are the linear combinations of the
spins on the corner sites of the cube, and obeys the modified vertex type
tetrahedron equation. This vertex model can be regard as a deformation of the
one related the three-dimensional Baxter-Bazhanov model. The constrained
conditions of the spectrums are discussed in detail and the symmetry properties
of weight functions of the vertex model are presented.
