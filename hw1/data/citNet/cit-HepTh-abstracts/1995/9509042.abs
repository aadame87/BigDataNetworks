  The evidence for string/string-duality can be extended from the matching of
the vector couplings to gravitational couplings. In this note this is shown in
the rank three example, the closest stringy analog of the Seiberg/Witten-setup,
which is related to the Calabi-Yau $WP^4_{1,1,2,2,6}(12)$. I provide an exact
analytical verification of a relation checked by coefficient comparison to
fourth order by Kaplunovsky, Louis and Theisen.
