We show the existence of self-dual semilocal nontopological vortices in a
$\Phi^2$ Chern-Simons (C-S) theory. The model of scalar and gauge fields with a
$SU(2)_{global} \times U(1)_{local}$ symmetry includes both the C-S term and an
anomalous magnetic contribution. It is demonstrated here, that the vortices are
stable or unstable according to whether the vector topological mass $\kappa$ is
less than or greater than the mass $m$ of the scalar field. At the boundary,
$\kappa = m$, there is a two-parameter family of solutions all saturating the
self-dual limit. The vortex solutions continuously interpolates between a ring
shaped structure and a flux tube configuration.
