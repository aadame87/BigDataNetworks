  The recent discovery of an explicit conformal field theory description of
Type II $p$-branes makes it possible to investigate the existence of bound
states of such objects. In particular, it is possible with reasonable precision
to verify the prediction that the Type IIB superstring in ten dimensions has a
family of soliton and bound state strings permuted by $SL(2,{\bf Z})$. The
space-time coordinates enter tantalizingly in the formalism as non-commuting
matrices.
