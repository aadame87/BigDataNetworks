  In this paper we discuss the hyperelliptic curve for $N=2$ $SU(3)$ super
Yang-Mills with six flavors of hypermultiplets. We start with a generic genus
two surface and construct the curve in terms of genus two theta functions. From
this one can construct the curve for $m_i=u=0$. This curve is explicitly dual
under a subgroup of $Sp(4,Z)$ which is not isomorphic to $Sp(2,Z)$. We then
proceed to construct the curve for the general $SU(3)$ theory and discuss the
duality properties of the theory. The results given here differ from those
given previously.
