  A short informal overview about recent progress in the calculation of the
effective action in quantum gravity is given. I describe briefly the standard
heat kernel approach to the calculation of the effective action and discuss the
applicability of the Schwinger - De Witt asymptotic expansion in the case of
strong background fields. I propose a new ansatz for the heat kernel that
generalizes the Schwinger - De Witt one and is always valid. Then I discuss the
general structure of the asymptotic expansion and put forward some approximate
explicitly covariant methods for calculating the heat kernel, namely, the
high-energy approximation as well as the low-energy one. In both cases the
explicit formulae for the heat kernel are given.
