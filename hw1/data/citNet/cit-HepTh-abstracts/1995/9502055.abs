Periodic classical trajectories are of fundamental importance both in classical
and quantum physics. Here we develop path integral techniques to investigate
such trajectories in an arbitrary, not necessarily energy conserving
hamiltonian system. In particular, we present a simple derivation of a lower
bound for the number of periodic classical trajectories.
