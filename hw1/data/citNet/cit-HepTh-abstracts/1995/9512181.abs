  The dynamics of superstring, supergravity and M theories and their
compactifications are probed by studying the various perturbation theories that
emerge in the strong and weak coupling limits for various directions in
coupling constant space. The results support the picture of an underlying
non-perturbative theory that, when expanded perturbatively in different
coupling constants, gives different perturbation theories, which can be
perturbative superstring theories or superparticle theories. The $p$-brane
spectrum is considered in detail and a criterion found to establish which
$p$-branes govern the strong coupling dynamics. In many cases there are
competing conjectures in the literature, and this analysis decides between
them. In other cases, new results are found. The chiral six-dimensional theory
resulting from compactifying the type IIB string on $K_3$ is studied in detail
and it is found that certain strong coupling limits appear to give new
theories, some of which hint at the possibility of a twelve-dimensional origin.
