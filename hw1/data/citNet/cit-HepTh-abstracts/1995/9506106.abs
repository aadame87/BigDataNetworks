  This model also known as chiral null model is a generalization of the
gravitational wave and fundamental string background and is exact in the $\a'$
expansion. The reduction to 4 dimensions yields a stationary IWP solution which
couples to 7 gauge fields (one gravi-photon and 6 matter gauge fields) and 4
scalars. Special cases are the Taub-NUT geometry and rotating black holes.
These solutions possess a T-self-dual point where the black hole becomes
massless. Discussing the S-duality we show that the Taub-NUT geometry allows an
S-self-dual point and that the electric black hole corresponds to a magnetic
black hole or an H-monopole. We could identify the massless black hole as
$N_L=0$ and confirm the H-monopole as an $N_L=1$ string states.
