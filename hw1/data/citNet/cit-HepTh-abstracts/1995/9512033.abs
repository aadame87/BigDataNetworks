  We consider a certain local generalization of BRS transformations of
Yang-Mills theory in which the anti-commuting parameter is space time
dependent. While these are not exact symmetries, they do lead to a new
nontrivial WT identity. We make a precise connection between the ``local BRS
"and the broken orthosymplectic symmetry recently found in superspace
formulation of Yang-Mills theory by showing that the local BRS WT identity is
precisely the WT identity obtained in the superspace formulation via a
superrotation. This ``local BRS " WT identity could lead to new consequences
not contained in the usual BRS WT identity.
