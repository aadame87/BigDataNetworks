Title: QED_2 and U(1)-Problem

  QED_2 with mass and N flavors of fermions is constructed using Euclidean path
integrals. The fermion masses are treated perturbatively and the convergence of
the mass perturbation series is proven for a finite space-time cutoff. The
expectation functional is decomposed into clustering theta-vacua and their
properties are compared to the theta-vacua of QCD for zero fermion mass. The
sector that is created by the N^2 classically conserved vector currents is
identified. The currents that correspond to a Cartan subalgebra of U(N) are
bosonized together with the chiral densities in terms of a generalized
Sine-Gordon model. The solution of the U(1)-problem of QED_2 is discussed and a
Witten-Veneziano formula is shown to hold for the mass spectrum of the
pseudoscalars. Evaluation of the Fredenhagen-Marcu confinement order parameter
clarifies the structure of superselection sectors.
