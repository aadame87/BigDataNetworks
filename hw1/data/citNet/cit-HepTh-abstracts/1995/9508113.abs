  Introducing a chemical potential in the functional method, we construct the
effective action of QED$_3$ with a Chern-Simons term. We examine a possibility
that charge condensation $\langle\psi^\dagger\psi \rangle$ remains nonzero at
the limit of the zero chemical potential. If it happens, spontaneous
magnetization occurs due to the Gauss' law constraint which connects the charge
condensation to the background magnetic field. It is found that the stable
vacuum with nonzero charge condensation is realized only when fermion masses
are sent to zero, keeping it lower than the chemical potential. This result
suggests that the spontaneous magnetization is closely related to the fermion
mass.
