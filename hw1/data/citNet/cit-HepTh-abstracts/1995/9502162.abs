We construct the most general local effective actions for Goldstone boson
fields associated with spontaneous symmetry breakdown from a group $G$ to a
subgroup $H$. In a preceding paper, it was shown that any $G$-invariant term in
the action, which results from a non-invariant Lagrangian density, corresponds
to a non-trivial generator of the de Rham cohomology classes of $G/H$. Here, we
present an explicit construction of all the generators of this cohomology for
any coset space $G/H$ and compact, connected group $G$. Generators contributing
to actions in 4-dimensional space-time arise either as products of generators
of lower degree such as the Goldstone-Wilczek current, or are of the
Wess-Zumino-Witten type. The latter arise if and only if $G$ has a non-zero
$G$-invariant symmetric $d$-symbol, which vanishes when restricted to the
subgroup $H$, i.e. when $G$ has anomalous representations in which $H$ is
embedded in an anomaly free way. Coupling of additional gauge fields leads to
actions whose gauge variation coincides with the chiral anomaly, which is
carried here by Goldstone boson fields at tree level. Generators contributing
to actions in 3-dimensional space-time arise as Chern-Simons terms evaluated on
connections that are composites of the Goldstone field.
