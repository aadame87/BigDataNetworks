  We study deformations of closed string theory by primary fields of conformal
weight $(1,1)$, using conformal techniques on the complex plane. A canonical
surface integral formalism for computing commutators in a non-holomorphic
theory is constructed, and explicit formul\ae for deformations of operators are
given. We identify the unique regularization of the arising divergences that
respects conformal invariance, and consider the corresponding parallel
transport. The associated connection is metric compatible and carries no
curvature.
