  Quantum integrable models that possess $N=2$ supersymmetry are investigated
on the half-space. Conformal perturbation theory is used to identify some $N=2$
supersymmetric boundary integrable models, and the effective boundary
Landau-Ginzburg actions are constructed. It is found that $N=2$ supersymmetry
largely determines the boundary action in terms of the bulk, and in particular,
the boundary bosonic potential is $|W|^2$, where $W$ is the bulk
superpotential. Supersymmetry is also discussed from the perspective of the
affine quantum group symmetry of exact scattering matrices, and exact $N=2$
supersymmetry preserving boundary reflection matrices are described.
