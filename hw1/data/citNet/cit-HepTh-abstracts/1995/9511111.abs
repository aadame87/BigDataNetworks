  We consider the theory of bosonic closed strings on the flat background
R(25,1). We show how the BRST complex can be extended to a complex where the
string center of mass operator, x^mu_0, is well defined. We investigate the
cohomology of the extended complex. We demonstrate that this cohomology has a
number of interesting features. Unlike in the standard BRST cohomology, there
is no doubling of physical states in the extended complex. The cohomology of
the extended complex is more physical in a number of of aspects related to the
zero-momentum states. In particular, we show that the ghost number one
zero-momentum cohomology states are in one to one correspondence with the
generators of the global symmetries of the background i.e., the Poincare
algebra.
