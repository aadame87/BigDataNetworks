  Using heterotic/type II string duality, we obtain exact nonperturbative
results for the point particle limit (alpha' -> 0) of some particular four
dimensional, N=2 supersymmetric compactifications of heterotic strings. This
allows us to recover recent exact nonperturbative results on N=2 gauge theory
directly from tree-level type II string theory, which provides a highly
non-trivial, quantitative check on the proposed string duality. We also
investigate to what extent the relevant singular limits of Calabi-Yau manifolds
are related to the Riemann surfaces that underlie rigid N=2 gauge theory.
