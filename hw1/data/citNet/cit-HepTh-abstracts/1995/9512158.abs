  The equation of motion of affine Toda field theory is a coupled equation for
$r$ fields, $r$ is the rank of the underlying Lie algebra. Most of the theories
admit reduction, in which the equation is satisfied by fewer than $r$ fields.
The reductions in the existing literature are achieved by identifying (folding)
the points in the Dynkin diagrams which are connected by symmetry
(automorphism). In this paper we present many new reductions. In other words
the symmetry of affine Dynkin diagrams could be extended and it leads to
non-canonical foldings. We investigate these reductions in detail and formulate
general rules for possible reductions. We will show that eventually most of the
theories end up in $a_{2n}^{(2)}$ that is the theory cannot have a further
dimension $m$ reduction where $m<n$.
