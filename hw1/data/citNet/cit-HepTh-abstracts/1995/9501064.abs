\\
We consider the heat-kernel expansion of the massive Laplace operator on the
three dimensional ball with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using this example,
we illustrate a very effective scheme for the calculation of an (in principle)
arbitrary number of heat-kernel coefficients for the case where the basis
functions are known. New results for the coefficients $B_{\frac 5 2},...,B_5$
are presented.
