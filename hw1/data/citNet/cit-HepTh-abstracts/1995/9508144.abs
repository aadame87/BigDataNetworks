  Using finite abelian automorphism groups of $K3$ we construct orbifold
candidates for Type IIA-heterotic dual pairs with maximal supersymmetry in six
and lower dimensions. On the heterotic side, these results extend the series of
known reduced rank theories with maximal supersymmetry. The corresponding Type
IIA theories generalize the Schwarz and Sen proposal for the dual of the
simplest of the reduced rank theories constructed as a novel Type IIA $\IZ_2$
orbifold.
