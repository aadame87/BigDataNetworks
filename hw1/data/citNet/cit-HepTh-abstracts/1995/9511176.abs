  We analyze nonabelian massive Higgs-free theories in the causal
Epstein-Glaser approach. Recently, there has been renewed interest in these
models. In particular we consider the well-known Curci-Ferrari model and the
nonabelian St\"uckelberg models. We explicitly show the reason why the
considered models fail to be unitary. In our approach only the asymptotic
(linear) BRS-symmetry has to be considered.
