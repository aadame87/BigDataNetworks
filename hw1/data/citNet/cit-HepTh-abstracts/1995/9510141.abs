  We introduce the self-dual abelian gauged $O(3)$ sigma models where the
Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms constitute the kinetic terms for the gauge
field. These models have quite rich structures and various limits. Our models
are found to exhibit both symmetric and broken phases of the gauge group. We
discuss the pure Chern-Simons limit in some detail and study rotationally
symmetric solitons.
