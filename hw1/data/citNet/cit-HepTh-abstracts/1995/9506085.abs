  We evaluate the exact ${\rm QED}_{2+1}$ effective energy for charged spin
zero and spin half fields in the presence of a family of static magnetic field
profiles localized in a strip of width $\lambda$. The exact result yields an
infinite set of relations between the terms in the derivative expansion of the
effective energy for a general magnetic field. Upon addition of the standard
Maxwell magneto-static energy, the minimum energy configuration at fixed flux
corresponds to a uniform magnetic field.
