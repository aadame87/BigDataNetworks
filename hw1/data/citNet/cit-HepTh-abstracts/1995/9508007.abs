  The $(g_2^{(1)}, d_4^{(3)})$\ pair of non simply laced affine Toda theories
is studied from the point of view of non perturbative duality. The classical
spectrum of each member is composed of two massive scalar particles. The exact
S-matrix prediction for the dual behaviour of the coupling dependent mass ratio
is found to be in strong agreement with Monte Carlo data.
