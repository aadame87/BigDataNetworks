We present a dual formulation of the construction of N=2 nonlinear sigma-model
type conformal field theories with c=9 which are mainly used as internal
sectors of Calabi-Yau heterotic string compactifications. The supercurrents and
the higher components of the spectral flow superfields turn out in each case to
be tensor products of two simple currents of a c=1 and a non-supersymmetric
parafermionic c=8 CFT. The characters of the latter model can be regarded as
string functions of the coset sigma/U(1). In particular, for the (1)^9 Gepner
model we discuss these string functions in detail, realizing this model
contains a broken E_8 gauge symmetry of which only the abelian subalgebra
remains a symmetry of the spectrum. As an example, we construct a simple model
leading to a string theory with a massless spectrum of 36 E_6 generations and
an extended gauge symmetry E_6 x SU(3)^4.
