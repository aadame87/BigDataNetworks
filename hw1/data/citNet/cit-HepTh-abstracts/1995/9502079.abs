  In this Letter, we construct a set of order parameters for non-Abelian gauge
theories which probe directly the unbroken group and are free of the
deficiencies caused by quantum fluctuations and gauge fixing which have plagued
all previous attempts. These operators can be used to map out the phase diagram
of a non-Abelian gauge theory.
