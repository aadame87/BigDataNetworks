Title: Symplectic and Poisson Geometry on Loop Spaces of Manifolds and
  Nonlinear Equations
Author: Oleg Mokhov (Steklov Mathematical Institute)

\\
We consider some differential geometric classes of local and nonlocal Poisson
and symplectic structures on loop spaces of smooth manifolds which give natural
Hamiltonian and multihamiltonian representations for some important nonlinear
equations of mathematical physics and field theory such as nonlinear sigma
models with torsion, degenerate Lagrangian systems of field theory, systems of
hydrodynamic type, N-component systems of Heisenberg magnet type,
Monge-Amp\`ere equations, the Krichever-Novikov equation and others. In
addition, we shall prove integrability of some class of nonhomogeneous systems
of hydrodynamic type and give a description of nonlinear partial differential
equations of associativity in $2D$ topological field theories (for some special
type solutions of the Witten-Dijkgraaf-E.Verlinde-H.Verlinde (WDVV) system) as
integrable nondiagonalizable weakly nonlinear homogeneous systems of
hydrodynamic type.
