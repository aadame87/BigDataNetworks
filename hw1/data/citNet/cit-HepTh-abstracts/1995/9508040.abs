  The effects of three-dimensional perturbations in two-dimensional turbulence
are investigated, through a conformal field theory approach. We compute scaling
exponents for the energy spectra of enstrophy and energy cascades, in a strong
coupling limit, and compare them to the values found in recent experiments. The
extension of unperturbed conformal turbulence to the present situation is
performed by means of a simple physical picture in which the existence of small
scale random forces is closely related to deviations of the exact
two-dimensional fluid motion.
