  It has previously been shown that a BRST quantization on an inner product
space leads to physical states of the form |ph>=e^[Q, \psi] |\phi> where |\phi>
is either a trivially BRST invariant state which only depends on the matter
variables, |\phi>_1, or a solution of a Dirac quantization, |\phi>_2. \psi is a
corresponding fermionic gauge fixing operator, \psi_1 or \psi_2. We show here
for abelian and nonabelian models that one may also choose a linear combination
of \psi_1 and \psi_2 for both choices of |\phi> except for a discrete set of
relations between the coefficients. A general form of the coBRST charge
operator is also determined and shown to be equal to such a \psi for an allowed
linear combination of \psi_1 and \psi_2. This means that the coBRST charge is
always a good gauge fixing fermion.
