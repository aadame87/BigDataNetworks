We discuss a duality of (0,2) heterotic string vacua which implies that certain
pairs of (0,2) Calabi-Yau compactifications on topologically distinct target
manifolds yield identical string theories. Some complex structure moduli in one
model are interpreted in the dual model as deforming the holomorphic structure
of the vacuum gauge bundle (and vice versa). A better understanding of
singularity resolution for (0,2) models may reveal that this duality of
compactifications on singular spaces is part of a larger story, involving
smooth topology-changing processes which interpolate between the (0,2) models
on the resolved spaces.
