  Techniques are presented for calculating directly the scalar functional
determinant on the Euclidean d-ball. General formulae are given for Dirichlet
and Robin boundary conditions. The method involves a large mass asymptotic
limit which is carried out in detail for d=2 and d=4 incidentally producing
some specific summations and identities. Extensive use is made of the
Watson-Kober summation formula.
