  With the perspective of looking for experimentally detectable physical
applications of the so-called topological embedding, a procedure recently
proposed by the author for quantizing a field theory around a non-discrete
space of classical minima (instantons, for example), the physical implications
are discussed in a ``theoretical'' framework, the ideas are collected in a
simple logical scheme and the topological version of the Ginzburg-Landau theory
of superconductivity is solved in the intermediate situation between type I and
type II superconductors.
