  Symplectic geometry of the vortex filament in a curved three-manifold is
investigated. There appears an infinite sequence of constants of motion in
involution in the case of constant curvature. The Duistermaat-Heckman formula
is examined perturbatively for the classical partition function in our model
and verified up to the 3-loop order.
