Title: Double Scaling Limits, Airy Functions and Multicritical Behaviour in
  O(N) Vektor Sigma Models

\\
  O(N) vector sigma models possessing catastrophes in their action are studied.
Coupling the limit N --> infinity with an appropriate scaling behaviour of the
coupling constants, the partition function develops a singular factor. This is
a generalized Airy function in the case of spacetime dimension zero and the
partition function of a scalar field theory for positive spacetime dimension.
