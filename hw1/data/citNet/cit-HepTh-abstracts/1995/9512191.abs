  Recently, Witten has proposed a mechanism for symmetry enhancement in
$SO(32)$ heterotic string theory, where the singularity obtained by shrinking
an instanton to zero size is resolved by the appearance of an $Sp(1)$ gauge
symmetry. In this short letter, we consider spacetime constraints from anomaly
cancellation in six dimensions and D-flatness and demonstrate a subtlety which
arises in the moduli space when many instantons are shrunk to zero size.
