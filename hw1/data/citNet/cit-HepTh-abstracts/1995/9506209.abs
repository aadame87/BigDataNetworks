  In this paper we consider the contributions of anomalous commutators to
various QCD sum rules. Using a combination of the BJL limit with the operator
product expansion the results are presented in terms of the vacuum condensates
of gauge invariant operators. It is demonstrated that the anomalous
contributions are no negligible and reconcile various apparently contradictory
calculations.
