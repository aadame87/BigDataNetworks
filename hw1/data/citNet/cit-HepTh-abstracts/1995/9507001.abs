  Affine Toda field theory with a pure imaginary coupling constant is a
non-hermitian theory. Therefore the solutions of the equation of motion are
complex. However, in $1+1$ dimensions it has many soliton solutions with
remarkable properties, such as real total energy/momentum and mass. Several
authors calculated quantum mass corrections of the solitons by claiming these
solitons are stable. We show that there exists a large class of classical
solutions which develops singularity after a finite lapse of time. Stability
claims, in earlier literature, were made ignoring these solutions. Therefore we
believe that a formulation of quantum theory on a firmer basis is necessary in
general and for the quantum mass corrections of solitons, in particular.
