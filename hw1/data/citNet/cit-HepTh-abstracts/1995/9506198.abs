  The quantum affine symmetry of the sine-Gordon theory at q^2 = 1, which
occurs at the reflectionless points, is studied. Conserved currents that
correspond to the closure of simple root generators are considered, and shown
to be local. We argue that they satisfy the affine sl(2) algebra. Examples of
these currents are explicitly constructed.
