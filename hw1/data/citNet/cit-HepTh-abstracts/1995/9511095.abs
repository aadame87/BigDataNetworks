  In this paper we show how the BRST quantization can be applied to systems
possessing only second-class constraints through their conversion to some
first-class ones starting with our method exposed in [Nucl.Phys. B456
(1995)473]. Thus, it is proved that i) for a certain class of second-class
systems there exists a standard coupling between the variables of the original
phase-space and some extravariables such that we can transform the original
system into a one-parameter family of first-class systems; ii) the BRST
quantization of this family in a standard gauge leads to the same path integral
as that of the original system. The analysis is accomplished in both reducible
and irreducible cases. In the same time, there is obtained the Lagrangian
action of the first-class family and its provenience is clarified. In this
context, the Wess-Zumino action is also derived. The results from the
theoretical part of the paper are exemplified in detail for the massive
Yang-Mills theory and for the massive abelian three-form gauge fields.
