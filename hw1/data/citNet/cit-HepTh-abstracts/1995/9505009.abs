  We give a simple geometrical picture of the basic structures of the covariant
$Sp(2)$ symmetric quantization formalism -- triplectic quantization -- recently
suggested by Batalin, Marnelius and Semikhatov. In particular, we show that the
appearance of an even Poisson bracket is not a particular property of
triplectic quantization. Rather, any solution of the classical master equation
generates on a Lagrangian surface of the antibracket an even Poisson bracket.
Also other features of triplectic quantization can be identified with aspects
of conventional Lagrangian BRST quantization without extended BRST symmetry.
