  A discussion of the number of degrees of freedom, and their dynamical
properties, in higher derivative gravitational theories is presented. It is
shown that non-vanishing $(C_{mnpq})^{2}$ terms arise in N=1, D=4 superstring
Lagrangians due to one-loop radiative corrections with light field internal
lines.
