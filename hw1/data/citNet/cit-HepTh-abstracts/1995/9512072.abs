  The phase structure of a $(2+1)$ - dimensional model of relativistic fermions
with a four fermi interaction is analyzed in the strong coupling regime using
the large $N$ perturbation theory. It is shown that, this model exhibits a low
temperature superconducting phase due to the vortex-anti vortex binding via
Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism. Above a critical temperature, vortices unbind
and superconductivity is destroyed; at a still higher temperature the vacuum
expectation value of a neutral order parameter vanishes. The ground state
respects parity and time reversal symmetries.
