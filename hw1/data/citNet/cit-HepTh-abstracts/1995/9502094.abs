We discuss the dressing of one-loop sigma-model beta-functions by induced
supergravity, for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric theories. We obtain exact
results by a superconformal gauge argument, and verify them in the
semi-classical limit by explicit perturbative calculations in the light-cone
gauge. We find that for N=2 theories there is no dressing of the one-loop
beta-functions.
