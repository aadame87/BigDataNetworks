We revise the twistor--like superfield approach to describing super--p--branes
by use of the basic principles of the group--manifold approach \cite{rheo}. A
super--p--brane action is constructed solely of geometrical objects as the
integral over a (p+1)--surface. The Lagrangian is the external product of
supervielbein differential forms in world supersurface and target superspace
without any use of Lagrange multipliers. This allows one to escape the problem
of infinite irreducible symmetries and redundant propagating fields. All the
constraints on the geometry of world supersurface and the conditions of its
embedding into target superspace arise from the action as differential form
equations.
