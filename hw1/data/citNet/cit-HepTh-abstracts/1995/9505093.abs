  In this paper, we review various properties of the supersymmetric Two Boson
(sTB) system. We discuss the equation and its nonstandard Lax representation.
We construct the local conserved charges as well as the Hamiltoniam structures
of the system. We show how this system leads to various other known
supersymmetric integrable models under appropriate field redefinition. We
discuss the sTB and the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger (sNLS) equations
as constrained, nonstandard supersymmetric Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (sKP) systems
and point out that the nonstandard sKP systems naturally unify all the KP and
mKP flows while leading to a new integrable supersymmetrization of the KP
equation. We construct the nonlocal conserved charges associated with the sTB
system and show that the algebra of charges corresponds to a graded, cubic
algebra. We also point out that the sTB system has a hidden supersymmetry
making it an $N=2$ extended supersymmetric system.
