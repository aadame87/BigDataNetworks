A survey of solutions to the cosmological moduli problem in string theory. The
only extant proposal which may work is Intermediate Scale Inflation as proposed
by Randall and Thomas. Supersymmetry preserving dynamics which could give large
masses to the moduli is strongly constrained by cosmology and requires the
existence of string vacuum states possessing properties different from those of
any known vacuuum. Such a mechanism cannot give mass to the dilaton unless
there are cancellations between different exponentially small contributions to
the superpotential. Our investigation also shows that stationary points of the
effective potential with negative vacuum energy do not correspond to stationary
solutions of the equations of postinflationary cosmology. This suggests that
supersymmetry breaking is a requirement for a successful inflationary
cosmology.
