  We use the dual description proposed by Seiberg to calculate the pressure in
the low temperature confined phase of $N=1$ supersymmetric QCD using
perturbation theory to $O(g^3_m)$, where $g_m$ is the gauge coupling in the
dual theory. Combining this result with the usual high temperature expansion
based on asymptotic freedom, we study how the physics in the intermediate
temperature regime depends on the relative size of the scale parameters in the
two descriptions. In particular we explore the possibility of having a
temperature range where both perturbation expansions are valid.
