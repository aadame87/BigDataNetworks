  The nature of Mean Field Solutions to the Equations of Motion of the
Chern--Simons Landau--Ginsberg (CSLG) description of the Fractional Quantum
Hall Effect (FQHE) is studied. Beginning with the conventional description of
this model at some chemical potential $\mu_0$ and magnetic field $B$
corresponding to a ``special'' filling fraction $\nu=2\pi\rho/eB=1/n$
($n=1,3,5\cdot \cdot\cdot$) we show that a deviation of $\mu$ in a finite range
around $\mu_0$ does not change the Mean Field solution and thus the mean
density of particles in the model. This result holds not only for the lowest
energy Mean Field solution but for the vortex excitations as well. The vortex
configurations do not depend on $\mu$ in a finite range about $\mu_0$ in this
model. However when $\mu-\mu_0 < \mu_{cr}^-$ (or $\mu-\mu_0>\mu_{cr}^+$) the
lowest energy Mean Field solution describes a condensate of vortices (or
antivortices). We give numerical examples of vortex and antivortex
configurations and discuss the range of $\mu$ and $\nu$ over which the system
of vortices is dilute.
