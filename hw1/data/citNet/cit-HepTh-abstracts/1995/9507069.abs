Title: A discussion on a possibility to interpret quantum mechanics in terms of
  general relativity

  It is shown that, with some reasonable assumptions, the theory of general
relativity can be made compatible with quantum mechanics by using the field
equations of general relativity to construct a Robertson-Walker metric for a
quantum particle so that the line element of the particle can be transformed
entirely to that of the Minkowski spacetime, which is assumed by a quantum
observer, and the spacetime dynamics of the particle described by a Minkowski
observer takes the form of quantum mechanics. Spacetime structure of a quantum
particle may have either positive or negative curvature. However, in order to
be describable using the familiar framework of quantum mechanics, the spacetime
structure of a quantum particle must be "quantised" by an introduction of the
imaginary number $i$. If a particle has a positive curvature then the
quantisation is equivalent to turning the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime of the
particle into a Riemannian spacetime. This means that it is assumed the
particle is capable of measuring its temporal distance like its spatial
distances. On the other hand, when a particle has a negative curvature and a
negative energy density then quantising the spacetime structure of the particle
is equivalent to viewing the particle as if it had a positive curvature and a
positive energy density.
