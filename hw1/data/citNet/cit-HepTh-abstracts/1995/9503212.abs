  It is argued that many linear (0,2) models flow in the infrared to
conformally invariant solutions of string theory. The strategy in the argument
is to show that the effective space-time superpotential must vanish because
there is no place where it can have a pole. This conclusion comes from either
of two different analyses, in which the Kahler class or the complex structure
of the gauge bundle is varied, while keeping everything else fixed. In the
former case, we recover from the linear sigma model the usual simple pole in
the ${\bf \bar {27}}^3$ Yukawa coupling but show that an analogous pole does
not arise in the couplings of gauge singlet modes. In the latter case, a
dimension count shows that the world-sheet instanton sum does not ``see'' the
singularities of the gauge bundle and hence cannot have a pole.
