  The heterotic string occurs as a soliton of the type I superstring in ten
dimensions, supporting the conjecture that these two theories are equivalent.
 The conjecture that the type IIB string is self-dual, with the strong coupling
dynamics described by a dual type IIB theory, is supported by the occurrence of
the dual string as a Ramond-Ramond soliton of the weakly-coupled theory.
