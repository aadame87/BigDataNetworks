  We construct $N=1$ supergravity models where the gauge symmetry and
supersymmetry are both spontaneously broken, with naturally vanishing classical
vacuum energy and unsuppressed Goldstino components along gauge non-singlet
directions. We discuss some physically interesting situations where such a
mechanism could play a role, and identify the breaking of a grand-unified gauge
group as the most likely possibility. We show that, even when the gravitino
mass is much smaller than the scale $m_X$ of gauge symmetry breaking, important
features can be missed if we first naively integrate out the degrees of freedom
of mass ${\cal O} (m_X)$, in the limit of unbroken supersymmetry, and then
describe the super-Higgs effect in the resulting effective theory. We also
comment on possible connections with extended supergravities and realistic
four-dimensional string constructions.
