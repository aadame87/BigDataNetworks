  We discuss a general approach to the nonperturbative treatment of quantum
field theories based on existence of effective gauge theory on auxiliary
''spectral" Riemann curve. We propose an effective formulation for the exact
solutions to some examples of $2d$ string models and $4d$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories and consider their natural generalizations.
