  A non trivial application of a modern computer language ("C") in a highly
structured and object-oriented fashion is presented. The contest is that of Lie
algebra representations (irreps), specifically the problem of reducing the
products of irreps with the weight tree algorithm. The new WBase V2.0 version
with table-generation and Young tableaux display capabilities is introduced.
