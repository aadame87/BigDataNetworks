  We propose a possible internal structure for a Schwarzschild black hole
resulting from the creation of multiple de Sitter universes with lightlike
boundaries when the curvature reaches Planckian values. The intersection of the
boundaries is studied and a scenario leading to disconnected de Sitter
universes is proposed. The application to the information loss problem is then
discussed.
