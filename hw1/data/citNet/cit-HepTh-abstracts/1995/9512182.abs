  We demonstrate that the Bailey pair formulation of Rogers-Ramanujan
identities unifies the calculations of the characters of $N=1$ and $N=2$
supersymmetric conformal field theories with the counterpart theory with no
supersymmetry. We illustrate this construction for the $M(3,4)$ (Ising) model
where the Bailey pairs have been given by Slater. We then present the general
unitary case. We demonstrate that the model $M(p,p+1)$ is derived from
$M(p-1,p)$ by a Bailey renormalization flow and conclude by obtaining the $N=1$
model $SM(p,p+2)$ and the unitary $N=2$ model with central charge $c=3(1-2/p).$
