  We derive a geometric integration formula for the partition function of a
classical dynamical system and use it to show that corrections to the WKB
approximation vanish for any Hamiltonian which generates conformal motions of
some Riemannian geometry on the phase space. This generalizes previous cases
where the Hamiltonian was taken as an isometry generator. We show that this
conformal symmetry is similar to the usual formulations of the
Duistermaat-Heckman integration formula in terms of a supersymmetric Ward
identity for the dynamical system. We present an explicit example of a
localizable Hamiltonian system in this context and use it to demonstrate how
the dynamics of such systems differ from previous examples of the
Duistermaat-Heckman theorem.
