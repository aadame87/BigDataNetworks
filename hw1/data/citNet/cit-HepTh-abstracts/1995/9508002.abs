  We give an explicit formalism connecting softly broken supersymmetric gauge
theories (with QCD as one limit) to $N=2$ and $N=1$ supersymmetric theories
possessing exact solutions, using spurion fields to embed these models in an
enlarged $N=1$ model. The functional forms of effective Lagrangian terms
resulting from soft supersymmetry breaking are constrained by the symmetries of
the enlarged model, although not well enough to fully determine the vacuum
structure of generic softly broken models. Nevertheless by perturbing the exact
$N=1$ model results with sufficiently small soft breaking masses, we show that
there exist nonsupersymmetric models that exhibit monopole condensation and
confinement in the same modes as the $N=1$ case.
