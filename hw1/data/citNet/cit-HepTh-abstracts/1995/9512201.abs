Title: Physical Spectra in String Theories --- BRST Operators and Similarity
  Transformations
Author: Mitsuhiro Kato
Comments: 15 pages, latex, no figures, Invited talk given at the "International
  Symposium on BRS Symmetry" (Sep. 18--22, 1995, RIMS Kyoto)

\\
  Several examples of similarity transformations connecting two string theories
with different backgrounds are reviewed. We also discuss general structure
behind the similarity transformations from the point of view of the topological
conformal algebra and of the non-linear realization of gauge symmetry.
