  We quantize the chiral Schwinger Model by using the Batalin-Tyutin formalism.
We show that one can systematically construct the first class constraints and
the desired involutive Hamiltonian, which naturally generates all secondary
constraints. For $a>1$, this Hamiltonian gives the gauge invariant Lagrangian
including the well-known Wess-Zumino terms, while for $a=1$ the corresponding
Lagrangian has the additional new type of the Wess-Zumino terms, which are
irrelevant to the gauge symmetry.
