  We prove that particle models whose action is given by the integrated $n$-th
curvature function over the world line possess $n+1$ gauge invariances. A
geometrical characterization of these symmetries is obtained via Frenet
equations by rephrasing the $n$-th curvature model in $\reals^d$ in terms of a
standard relativistic particle in $S^{d-n}$. We ``prove by example'' that the
algebra of these infinitesimal gauge invariances is nothing but $\W_{n+2}$,
thus providing a geometrical picture of the $\W$-symmetry for these models. As
a spin-off of our approach we give a new global invariant for four-dimensional
curves subject to a curvature constraint.
