By means of a generalized quartet mechanism we show in a model independent way
that a BRST quantization on an inner product space leads to physical states of
the form |ph>=e^{[Q, \psi]} |ph>_0 where Q is the nilpotent BRST operator, \psi
a hermitian fermionic gauge fixing operator, and |ph>_0 BRST invariant states
determined by a hermitian set of BRST doublets in involution. |ph>_0 does not
belong to an inner product space although |ph> does. Since the BRST quartets
are split into two sets of hermitian BRST doublets there are two choices for
|ph>_0 and the corresponding \psi. When applied to general, both irreducible
and reducible, gauge theories of arbitrary rank within the BFV formulation we
find that |ph>_0 are trivial BRST invariant states which only depend on the
matter variables for one set of solutions, and for the other set |ph>_0 are
solutions of a Dirac quantization. This generalizes previous Lie group
solutions obtained by means of a bigrading.
