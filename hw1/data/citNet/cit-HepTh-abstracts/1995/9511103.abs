  Schild's null (tensionless) strings are discussed in certain flat and curved
backgrounds. We find closed, stationary, null strings as natural configurations
existing on the horizons of spacetimes which possess such null hypersurfaces.
Examples of these are obtained in Schwarzschild and Rindler spacetimes. A
dynamic null string is also identified in Rindler spacetime. Furthermore, a
general prescription (with explicit examples) is outlined by means of which
null string configurations can be obtained in a large class of cosmological
backgrounds.
