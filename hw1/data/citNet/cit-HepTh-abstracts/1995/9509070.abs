  Recently a great deal of evidence has been found indicating that type IIA
string theory compactified on K3 is equivalent to heterotic string theory
compactified on T^4. Under the transformation which relates the two theories,
the roles of fundamental and solitonic string solutions are interchanged. In
this letter we show that there exists a solitonic membrane solution of the
heterotic string theory which becomes a singular solution of the type IIA
theory, and should therefore be interpreted as a fundamental membrane in the
latter theory. We speculate upon the implications that the complete type IIA
theory is a theory of membranes, as well as strings.
