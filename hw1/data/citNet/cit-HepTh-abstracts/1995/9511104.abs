  We show that, in 1+1 dimensional gauge theories, a heavy probe charge is
screened by dynamical massless fermions both in the case when the source and
the dynamical fermions belong to the same representation of the gauge group
and, unexpectedly, in the case when the representation of the probe charge is
smaller than the representation of the massless fermions. Thus, a fractionally
charged heavy probe is screened by dynamical fermions of integer charge in the
massless Schwinger model, and a colored probe in the fundamental representation
is screened in $QCD_2$ with adjoint massless Majorana fermions. The screening
disappears and confinement is restored as soon as the dynamical fermions are
given a non-zero mass. For small masses, the string tension is given by the
product of the light fermion mass and the fermion condensate with a known
numerical coefficient. Parallels with 3+1 dimensional $QCD$ and supersymmetric
gauge theories are discussed.
