  A new set of gauge invariant variables is defined to describe the physical
Hilbert space of $d = 3 + 1$ $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in the fixed-time
canonical formalism. A natural geometric interpretation arises due to the
$GL(3)$ covariance found to hold for the basic equations and commutators of the
theory in the canonical formalism. We emphasize, however, that we are not
interested in and do not consider the coupling of the theory to gravity. We
concentrate here on a technical difficulty of this approach, the calculation of
the electric field energy. This in turn hinges on the well-definedness of the
transformation of variables, an issue which is settled through degenerate
perturbation theory arguments.
