Title: Wigner's Last Papers on Spacetime Symmetries
Author: Y.S.Kim
Comments: 10 pages,latex, a review talk presented at the 4th International
  Wigner Symposium, Guadalajara, Mexico (August 1995)
\\
  Wigner's 1939 paper on representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group is
one of the most fundamental papers in physics. Wigner maintained his passion
for this subject throughout his life. In this report, I will review the papers
which he published with me on this subject. These papers deal with the question
of unifying the internal space-time symmetries of massive and massless
particles.
