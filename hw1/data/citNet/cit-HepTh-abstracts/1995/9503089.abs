Three dimensional black holes in a generalized dilaton gravity action theory
are analysed. The theory is specified by two fields, the dilaton and the
graviton, and two parameters, the cosmological constant and the Brans-Dicke
parameter. It contains seven different cases, of which one distinguishes as
special cases, string theory, general relativity and a theory equivalent to
four dimensional general relativity with one Killing vector. We study the
causal structure and geodesic motion of null and timelike particles in the
black hole geometries and find the ADM masses of the different solutions.
