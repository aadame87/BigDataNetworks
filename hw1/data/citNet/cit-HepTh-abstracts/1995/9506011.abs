  We show that the partition function of free Maxwell theory on a generic
Euclidean four-manifold transforms in a non-trivial way under electric-magnetic
duality. The classical part of the partition sum can be mapped onto the
genus-one partition function of a 2d toroidal model, without the oscillator
contributions. This map relates electric-magnetic duality to modular invariance
of the toroidal model and, conversely, the $O(d,d',\Z)$ duality to the
invariance of Maxwell theory under the 4d mapping class group. These dualities
and the relation between toroidal models and Maxwell theory can be understood
by regarding both theories as dimensional reductions of a self-dual 2-form
theory in six dimensions. Generalizations to more $U(1)$-gauge fields and
reductions from higher dimensions are also discussed. We find indications that
the Abelian gauge theories related to 4d string theories with $N=4$ space-time
supersymmetry are exactly duality invariant.
