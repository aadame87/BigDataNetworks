Title: Current Operators in Quantum Field Theory and Sum Rules in Deep
  Inelastic Scattering
Author: Felix M. Lev
Comments: 18 pages, LaTeX
\\
  It is shown that in the general case the canonical construction of the
current operators in quantum field theory does not render a bona fide vector
field since Lorentz invariance is violated by Schwinger terms. We argue that
the nonexistence of the canonical current operators for spinor fields follows
from a very simple algebraic consideration. As a result, the well-known sum
rules in deep inelastic scattering are not substantiated.
