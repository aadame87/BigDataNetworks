  For extremal black holes, the thermodynamic entropy is not proportional to
the area. The general form allowed by thermodynamics is worked out for three
classes of extremal black hole solutions of string theory and shown to be
consistent with the entropy calculated from the density of elementary string
states. On the other hand, the entanglement entropy does not in general agree
with these results.
