  In the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach to 2D integrable, ADE-related
quantum field theories one derives a set of algebraic functional equations (a
Y-system) which play a prominent role. This set of equations is mapped into the
problem of finding finite triangulations of certain 3D manifolds. This mapping
allows us to find a general explanation of the periodicity of the Y-system. For
the $A_N$ related theories and more generally for the various restrictions of
the fractionally-supersymmetric sine-Gordon models, we find an explicit,
surprisingly simple solution of such functional equations in terms of a single
unknown function of the rapidity. The recently-found dilogarithm functional
equations associated to the Y-system simply express the invariance of the
volume of a manifold for deformations of its triangulations.
