  We suggest a dual to an $SU(2k)$ Susy gauge theory containing an
antisymmetric tensor, $\nf$ fundamentals and $\nfb$ anti-fundamentals. This is
done by expanding the theory into an equivalent description with two gauge
groups and then performing known duality tranformations on each gauge group
separately. Chiral operators, mass perturbations and flat directions are
discussed.
