  We show that the problem of Random Walk with boundary attractive potential
may be mapped onto the free massive bosonic Quantum Field Theory with a line of
defect. This mapping permits to recover the statistical properties of the
Random Walks by using boundary $S$--matrix and Form Factor techniques.
