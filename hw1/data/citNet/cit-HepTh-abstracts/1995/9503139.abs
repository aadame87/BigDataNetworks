\\
  A method to construct free field realizations for the form factors of
diagonal factorized scattering theories is described. Form factors are
constructed from linear functionals over an associative `form factor algebra',
which in particular generate solutions of the deformed Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations with parameter $2\pi$. We show that there exists a unique deformation
off the (`Rindler') value $2\pi$ that preserves the original $S$-matrix and
which allows one to realize form factors as vector functionals over an algebra
of generalized vertex operators.
