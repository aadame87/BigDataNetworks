  We compute the exact partition function, the universal ground state
degeneracy and boundary state of the 2-D Ising model with boundary magnetic
field at off-critical temperatures. The model has a domain that exhibits states
localized near the boundaries. We study this domain of boundary bound state and
derive exact expressions for the ``$g$ function'' and boundary state for all
temperatures and boundary magnetic fields. In the massless limit we recover the
boundary renormalization group flow between the conformally invariant free and
fixed boundary conditions.
