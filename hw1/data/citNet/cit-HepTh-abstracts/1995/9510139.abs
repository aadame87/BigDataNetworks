  Using the well-known result for the fermionic determinant in terms of a WZW
theory, we write QCD$_2$ in bosonized form. After some manipulations we give
two versions of the theory, where it is factorized as a product of the
conformally invariant WZW models, ghost terms, and a WZW action perturbed off
criticality. We first prove that the latter is an integrable model.
Furthermore, as a consequence of the BRST analysis, there are several
constraints. Second-class constraints also show up. Using the integrability
condition we find higher conservation laws, their action on the asymptotic
states, and we propose an exact $S$-matrix for the physical excitations. The
vacuum structure is analysed, and we prove that a finite number of different
vacua exist. An outline of possible generalizations of the procedure is given.
