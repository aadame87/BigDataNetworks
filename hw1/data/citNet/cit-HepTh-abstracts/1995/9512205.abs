\\
  Two-point functions for scalar and spinor fields are investigated in Einstein
universe ($R \otimes S^{\sN-1}$). Equations for massive scalar and spinor
two-point functions are solved and the explicit expressions for the two-point
functions are given. The simpler expressions for massless cases are obtained
both for the scalar and spinor cases.
