  We present dyonic multi-membrane solutions of the N=2 D=8 supergravity theory
that serves as the effective field theory of the $T^2$-compactified type II
superstring theory. The `electric' charge is fractional for generic asymptotic
values of an axion field, as for D=4 dyons. These membrane solutions are
supersymmetric, saturate a Bogomolnyi bound, fill out orbits of an $Sl(2;\Z)$
subgroup of the type II D=8 T-duality group, and are non-singular when
considered as solutions of $T^3$-compactified D=11 supergravity. On $K_3$
compactification to D=4, the conjectured type II/heterotic equivalence allows
the $Sl(2;\Z)$ group to be reinterpreted as the S-duality group of the
toroidally compactified heterotic string and the dyonic membranes wrapped
around homology two-cycles of $K_3$ as S-duals of perturbative heterotic string
states.
