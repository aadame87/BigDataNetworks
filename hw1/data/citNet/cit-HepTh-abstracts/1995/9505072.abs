Title: The path integral for Chern-Simons quantum mechanics
Authors: Silvio J. Rabello and Arvind N. Vaidya
Comments: 9 pages, RevTex
\\
  The path integral representation for a system of N non-relativistic particles
on the plane, interacting through a Chern-Simons gauge field, is obtained from
the operator formalism. An effective interaction between the particles appears,
generating the usual Aharonov-Bohm phases. The spin-statistics relation is also
considered.
