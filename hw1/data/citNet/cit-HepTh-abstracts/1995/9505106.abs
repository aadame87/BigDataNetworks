  Multistring vertices and the overlap identities which they satisfy are
exploited to understand properties of hyperbolic Kac Moody algebras, and
$E_{10}$ in particular. Since any such algebra can be embedded in the larger
Lie algebra of physical states of an associated completely compactified
subcritical bosonic string, one can in principle determine the root spaces by
analyzing which (positive norm) physical states decouple from the $N$-string
vertex. Consequently, the Lie algebra of physical states decomposes into a
direct sum of the hyperbolic algebra and the space of decoupled states. Both
these spaces contain transversal and longitudinal states. Longitudinal
decoupling holds generally, and may also be valid for uncompactified strings,
with possible consequences for Liouville theory; the identification of the
decoupled states simply amounts to finding the zeroes of certain ``decoupling
polynomials''. This is not the case for transversal decoupling, which crucially
depends on special properties of the root lattice, as we explicitly demonstrate
for a non-trivial root space of $E_{10}$. Because the $N$-vertices of the
compactified string contain the complete information about decoupling, all the
properties of the hyperbolic algebra are encoded into them. In view of the
integer grading of hyperbolic algebras such as $E_{10}$ by the level, these
algebras can be interpreted as interacting strings moving on the respective
group manifolds associated with the underlying finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
