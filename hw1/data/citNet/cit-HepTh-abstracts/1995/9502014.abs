We propose a matrix-model derivation of the scaling exponents of the critical
and tricritical q-states Potts model coupled to gravity on a sphere. In close
analogy with the $O(n)$ model, we reduce the determination of the
one-loop-to-vacuum expectation to the resolution of algebraic equations; and
find the explicit scaling law for the case q=3.
