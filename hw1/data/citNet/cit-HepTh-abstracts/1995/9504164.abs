  It is argued that the gauge anomalies are only the artefacts of quantum field
theory when certain subtleties are not taken into account. With the Berry's
phase needed to satisfy certain boundary conditions of the generating path
integral, the gauge anomalies associated with homotopically nontrivial gauge
transformations are shown explicitly to be eliminated, without any extra
quantum fields introduced. This is in contra-distinction to other quantisations
of `anomalous' gauge theory where extra, new fields are introduced to
explicitly cancel the anomalies.
