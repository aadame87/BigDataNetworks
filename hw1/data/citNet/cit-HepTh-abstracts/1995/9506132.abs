  We discuss the equivalence of two dual scalar field theories in 2 dimensions.
The models are derived though the elimination of different fields in the same
Freedman--Townsend model. It is shown that tree $S$-matrices of these models do
not coincide. The 2-loop counterterms are calculated. It turns out that while
one of these models is single-charged, the other theory is multi-charged. Thus
the dual models considered are non-equivalent on classical and quantum levels.
It indicates the possibility of the anomaly leading to non-equivalence of dual
models.
