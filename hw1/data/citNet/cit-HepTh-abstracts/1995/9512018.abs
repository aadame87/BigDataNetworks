  It is shown that the new version of nonsymmetric gravitational theory (NGT)
corresponds in the linear approximation to linear Einstein gravity theory and
antisymmetric field equations with a non-conserved string source current. The
Hamiltonian for the antisymmetric field equations is bounded from below and
describes the exchange of a spin $1^+$ massive vector boson between open
strings. The non-Riemannian geometrical theory is formulated in terms of a
nonsymmetric fundamental tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$. The weak field limit,
$g_{[\mu\nu]}\rightarrow 0$, associated with large distance scales, corresponds
to the limit to a confinement region at low energies described by an effective
Yukawa potential at galactic distance scales. The limit to this low-energy
confinement region is expected to be singular and non-perturbative. The NGT
string theory predicts that there are no black hole event horizons associated
with infinite red shift null surfaces.
