  The systematic method for the conversion of first class constraints to the
equivalent set of Abelian one based on the Dirac equivalence transformation is
developed. The representation for the corresponding matrix performing this
transformation is proposed. This representation allows one to lead the problem
of abelianization to the solution of a certain system of first order {\it
linear } differential equations for matrix elements .
