  Within effective heterotic superstring theory compactified on a six-torus we
derive minimum energy (supersymmetric), static, spherically symmetric
solutions, which are manifestly invariant under the target space $O(6,22)$ and
the strong-weak coupling $SL(2)$ duality symmetries with 28 electric and 28
magnetic charges subject to one constraint. The class of solutions with a
constant axion corresponds to dyonic configurations subject to two charge
constraints, with purely electric [or purely magnetic] and dyonic
configurations preserving ${1\over 2}$ and ${1\over 4}$ of $N=4$ supersymmetry,
respectively. General dyonic configurations in this class have a space-time of
extreme Reissner-Nordstr\" om black holes while configurations with more
constrained charges have a null or a naked singularity.
