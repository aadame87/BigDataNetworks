In this article we consider an N-brane description of an (N+3)-dimensional
black hole horizon. First of all, we start by reviewing a previous work where a
string theory is used as describing the dynamics of the event horizon of a four
dimensional black hole. Then we consider a particle model defined on one
dimensional Euclidean line in a three dimensional black hole as a target
spacetime metric. By solving the field equations we find a ``world line
instanton'' which connects the past event horizon with the future one. This
solution gives us the exact value of the Hawking temperature and to leading
order the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole entropy. We also show that
this formalism is extensible to an arbitrary spacetime dimension. Finally we
make a comment of one-loop quantum correction to the black hole entropy .
