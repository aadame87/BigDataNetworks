  We extend work by Callan and Harvey and show how the phase of the chiral
fermion determinant in four dimensions is reproduced by zeromodes bound to a
domain wall in five dimensions. The analysis could shed light on the
applicability of zeromode fermions and the vacuum overlap formulation of
Narayanan and Neuberger for chiral gauge theories on the lattice.
