  The effective Lagrangian of arbitrary varying in space electromagnetic field
in a dense medium is derived. It has been used for investigation of interaction
between charged fermions in the medium. It is shown the possibility for the
formation of metastable electron bound states in the medium when external
magnetic field is applied.
