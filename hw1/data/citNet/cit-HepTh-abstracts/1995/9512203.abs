  We investigate possible existence of duality symmetries which exchange the
Kaluza-Klein modes with the wrapping modes of a BPS saturated $p$-brane on a
torus. Assuming the validity of the conjectured $U$-duality symmetries of type
II and heterotic string theories and $M$-theory, we show that for a BPS
saturated $p$-brane there is an SL(2,Z) symmetry that mixes the Kaluza-Klein
modes on a $(p+1)$ dimensional torus $T^{(p+1)}$ with the wrapping modes of the
$p$-brane on $T^{(p+1)}$. The field that transforms as a modular parameter
under this SL(2,Z) transformation has as its real part the component of the
$(p+1)$-form gauge field on $T^{(p+1)}$, and as its imaginary part the volume
of $T^{(p+1)}$, measured in the metric that couples naturally to the $p$-brane.
