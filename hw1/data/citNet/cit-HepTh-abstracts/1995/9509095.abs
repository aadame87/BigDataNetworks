  A description of dual non-Abelian duality is given, based on the notion of
the Drinfeld double. The presentation basically follows the original paper
\cite{KS2}, written in collaboration with P. \v Severa, but here the emphasis
is put on the algebraic rather than the geometric aspect of the construction
and a concrete example of the Borelian double is worked out in detail.
