Abstract In this letter we show that the overlap formulation of chiral gauge
theories correctly reproduces the gravitational Lorentz anomaly in
2-dimensions. This formulation has been recently suggested as a solution to the
fermion doubling problem on the lattice. The well known response to general
coordinate transformations of the effective action of Weyl fermions coupled to
gravity in 2-dimensions can also be recovered.
