We generalize and extend a quantization procedure proposed by the present
authors which is designed to quantize SU(N) gauge theories in the continuum
without fixing the gauge and thereby avoid the Gribov problem. In particular we
discuss the BRS symmetry underlying the effective action. We proceed to use
this BRS symmetry to discuss the perturbative renormalization of the theory and
show that perturbatively the procedure is equivalent to Landau gauge fixing.
This generalizes earlier results obtained in the Abelian case to the
non-abelian case and confirms the widely held believe that the Gribov problem
manifests itself on the non-perturbative level, while not affecting the
perturbative results. A relation between the gluon mass and gluon condensate in
QCD is obtained which yields a gluon mass consistent with other estimates for
values of the gluon condensate obtained from QCD sum rules.
