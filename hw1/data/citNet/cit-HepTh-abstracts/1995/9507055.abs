  We give a new proof of the renormalizability of a class of matter field
theories on a space-time lattice; in particular we consider $\phi^4$ and
massive Yukawa theories with Wilson fermions. We use the Polchinski approach to
renormalization, which is based on the Wilson flow equation; this approach is
substantially simpler than the BPHZ method, applied to the lattice by Reisz. We
discuss matter theories with staggered fermions. In particular we analyse a
simple kind of staggered fermions with minimal doubling, using which we prove
the renormalizability of a chiral sigma model with exact chiral symmetry on the
lattice.
