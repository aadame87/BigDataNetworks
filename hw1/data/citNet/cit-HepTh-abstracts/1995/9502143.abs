We consider a formulation of N=1 D=3,4 and 6 superparticle mechanics, which is
manifestly supersymmetric on the worldline and in the target superspace. For
the construction of the action we use only geometrical objects that
characterize the embedding of the worldline superspace into the target
superspace, such as target superspace coordinates of the superparticle and
twistor components. The action does not contain the Lagrange multipliers which
may cause the problem of infinite reducible symmetries, and, in fact, is a
worldline superfield generalization of the supertwistor description of
superparticle dynamics.
