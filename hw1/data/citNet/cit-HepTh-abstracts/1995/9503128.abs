  I propose an approximation scheme for asymptotically free field theories
combining both weak coupling and strong coupling series. The weak coupling
expansion is used to integrate the high frequency modes and the resulting low
energy effective theory is solved using the strong coupling expansion. In some
models there exists an intermediate scale at which both expansions make sense.
The method is tested on few low dimensional models for which an exact solution
is known.
