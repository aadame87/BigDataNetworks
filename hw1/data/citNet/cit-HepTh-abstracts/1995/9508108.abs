  The problem of how to put interactions in two-dimensional quantum gravity in
the strong coupling regime is studied. It shows that the most general
interaction consistent with this symmetry is a Liouville term that contain two
parameters $(\alpha, \beta)$ satisfying the algebraic relation $2\beta - \alpha
=2$ in order to assure the closure of the diffeomorphism algebra. The model is
classically soluble and it contains as general solution the temporal
singularity. The theory is quantized and we show that the propagation amplitude
fall tozero in $\tau =0$. This result shows that the classical singularities
are smoothed by quantum effects and the bing-bang concept could be considered
as a classical extrapolation instead of a physical concept.
