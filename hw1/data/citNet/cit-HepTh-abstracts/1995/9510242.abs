  We study the $SU(N)$, level $1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model, with affine primary
fields as spinon fields of fundamental representation. By evaluating the action
of the Yangian generators $Q_{0}^{a}, Q_{1}^{a}$ and the Hamiltonian $H_2$ on
two spinon states we get a new connection between this conformal field theory
and the Calogero-Sutherland model with $SU(N)$ spin. This connection clearly
confirms the need for the $W_3$ generator in $H_2$ and an additional term in
the $Q^{a}_{1}$. We also evaluate some energy spectra of $H_2$, by acting it on
multi-spinon states.
