  We present a topological quantum field theory which corresponds to the moduli
problem associated to Witten's monopole equations for four-manifolds. The
construction of the theory is carried out in purely geometrical terms using the
Mathai-Quillen formalism, and the corresponding observables are described.
These provide a rich set of new topological quantites.
