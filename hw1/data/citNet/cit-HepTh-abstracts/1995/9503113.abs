  Moduli fields, which parameterize perturbative flat directions of the
potential in supersymmetric theories, are natural candidates to act as
inflatons. An inflationary potential on moduli space can result if the scale of
dynamical SUSY breaking in some sector of the theory is determined by a moduli
dependent coupling. The magnitude of density fluctuations generated during
inflation then depends on the scale of SUSY breaking in this sector. This can
naturally be hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale in a dynamical model,
giving small fluctuations without any fine tuning of parameters. It is also
natural for SUSY to be restored at the minimum of the moduli potential, and to
leave the universe with zero cosmological constant after inflation. Acceptable
reheating can also be achieved in this scenario.
