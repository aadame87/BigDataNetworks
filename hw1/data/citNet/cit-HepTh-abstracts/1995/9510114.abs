  It is shown that the non-relativistic `Dirac' equation of L\'evy-Leblond, we
used recently to describe a spin $1/2$ field interacting non-relativistically
with a Chern-Simons gauge field, can be obtained by lightlike reduction from
$3+1$ dimensions. This allows us to prove that the system is Schr\"odinger
symmetric. A spinor representation of the Schr\"odinger group is presented.
Static, self-dual solutions, describing spinor vortices are given and shown to
be the non-relativistic limits of the fermionic vortices found by Cho et al.
The construction is extended to external harmonic and uniform magnetic fields.
