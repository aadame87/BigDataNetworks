We derive the exact action for a damped mechanical system ( and the special
case of the linear oscillator) from the path integral formulation of the
quantum Brownian motion problem developed by Schwinger and by Feynman and
Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom for dissipative
systems and thermal field theories is discussed and the initial values of the
doubled variables are related to quantum noise effects.
