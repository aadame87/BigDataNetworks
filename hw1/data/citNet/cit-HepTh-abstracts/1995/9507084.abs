  The generalization of Agranovich-Toshich representation of paulion operators
in terms of bosonic ones for the case of truncated oscillators of higher ranks
is represented. We use this generalization to introduce a new constraint free
bosonic description of truncated oscillator systems. The corresponding
functional integral representations for thermodynamic quantities are given and
the application to investigations of Long Rang Order in the system is
discussed.
