  We study embeddings of the Prasad-Sommerfield monopole solution in SU(N)
Super-QCD (N>2), where the role of the Higgs field is played by the squarks in
the fundamental representation. Classically, the resulting configurations live
in a phase with unbroken SU(k) subgroups of SU(N) (as a result they are not
topologically stable). The structure of zero modes is such that they can be
naturally interpreted as massive chiral superfields with R charge one and
baryon number zero, transforming in the adjoint representation of a dual gauge
group defined using the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive (GNO) framework. We discuss the
possible applications of these monopoles to N=1 duality, and more generally the
possibility of relating GNO-type dual gauge groups to those appearing in N=1
duality.
