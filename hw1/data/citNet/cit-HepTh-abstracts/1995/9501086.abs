The 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory with the Pontryagin term included is
studied on manifolds with a boundary. Based on the geometry of the universal
bundle for Yang-Mills theory, the symplectic structure of this model is
exhibited. The topological type of the quantization line bundles is shown to be
determined by the torsion elements in the cohomology of the gauge orbit space.
