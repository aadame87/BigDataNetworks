  This report is consisted of six independent chapters, each chapter (except
chapter 1) is a paper carried out in colabouration with others, who's names are
indicated in chapter1. The topics included are (1)Overview of general
properties of Toda-like systems (chapter1) (2)Free field representations of
some particular example of entended Toda like system via Drinfeld-Sokolov
construction (chapter2) (3)Heterotic conformal Toda system (chapter3)
(4)Heterotic Liouville systems related to Bernoulli equation (chapter4)
(5)Two-extended Toda field in three-dimensions--a representative example of
extended Toda systems in higher dimensions (chapter5) and (6) $W_N^{(l)}$
algebras in the exchange algebra's framework (chapter6)
