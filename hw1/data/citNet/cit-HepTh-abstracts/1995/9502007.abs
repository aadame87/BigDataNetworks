The dynamics of the early universe may have been profoundly influenced by
spatial anisotropies. A search for such backgrounds in the context of string
cosmology has uncovered the existence of an entire class of (spatatially)
homogeneous but not necessarily isotropic space-times, analogous to the class
of Bianchi-types in general relativity. Configurations with vanishing
cosmological constant but non-vanishing dilaton and antisymmetric field are
explicitly found for all types. This is a new class of solutions, whose
isotropy limits reproduce all known and, further, all possible FRW-type of
models in the string-cosmology context considered. There is always an initial
singularity and no inflation. Other features of the general solutions,
including their behaviour under abelian duality are are also discussed.
