  We discuss the phases of four dimensional gauge theories and demonstrate them
in solvable examples. Some of our simple examples exhibit confinement and
oblique confinement. The theory has dual magnetic and dual dyonic descriptions
in which these phenomena happen at weak coupling. Combined with the underlying
electric theory, which gives a weak coupling description of the Higgs phase, we
have electric-magnetic-dyonic triality. In an appendix we clarify some points
regarding the use of 1PI superpotentials in these theories.
