The topological $\sigma$ model with the black hole metric of the target space
is considered. It has been shown before that this model is in the phase with
BRST-symmetry broken. In particular, vacuum energy is non-\-zero and
correlation functions of observables show the coordinate dependence. However
these quantities turned out to be infrared (IR) divergent. It is shown here
that IR divergences disappear after the sum over an arbitrary number of
additional instanton-\-anti-\-instanton pairs is performed. The model appears
to be equivalent to Coulomb gas/Sine Gordon system.
