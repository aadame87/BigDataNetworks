  In this paper, we give a construction of $p$-brane solitons in all maximal
supergravity theories in $4\le D \le 11$ dimensions that are obtainable from
$D=11$ supergravity by dimensional reduction. We first obtain the full bosonic
Lagrangians for all these theories in a formalism adapted to the $p$-brane
soliton construction. The solutions that we consider involve one dilaton field
and one antisymmetric tensor field strength, which are in general linear
combinations of the basic fields of the supergravity theories. We also study
the supersymmetry properties of the solutions by calculating the eigenvalues of
the Bogomol'nyi matrices, which are derived from the commutators of the
supercharges. We give an exhaustive list of the supersymmetric $p$-brane
solutions using field strengths of all degrees $n=4,3,2,1$, and the
non-supersymmetric solutions for $n=4,3,2$. As well as studying elementary and
solitonic solutions, we also discuss dyonic solutions in $D=6$ and $D=4$. In
particular, we find that the Bogomol'nyi matrices for the supersymmetric
massless dyonic solutions have indefinite signature.
