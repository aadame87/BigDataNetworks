I study the time--symmetric initial--data problem in theories with a massless
scalar field (dilaton), free or coupled to a Maxwell field in the stringy way,
finding different initial--data sets describing an arbitrary number of black
holes with arbitrary masses, charges and asymptotic value of the dilaton. The
presence of the scalar field gives rise to a number of interesting effects. The
mass and charges of a single black hole are different in its two asymptotically
flat regions across the Einstein--Rosen bridge. The same happens to the value
of the dilaton at infinity. This forbids the identification of these asymptotic
regions in order to build (Misner) wormholes in the most naive way. Using
different techniques, I find regular initial data for stringy wormholes. The
price payed is the existence singularities in the dilaton field. The presence
of a single--valued scalar seems to constrain strongly the allowed topologies
of the initial space--like surface. Other kinds of scalar fields (taking values
on a circle or being defined up to an additive constant) are also briefly
considered.
