  In this letter we report on the computation of instanton-dominated
correlation functions in supersymmetric YM theories on ALE spaces. Following
the approach of Kronheimer and Nakajima, we explicitly construct the self-dual
connection on ALE spaces necessary to perform such computations. We restrict
our attention to the simplest case of an $SU(2)$ connection with lowest Chern
class on the Eguchi-Hanson gravitational background.
