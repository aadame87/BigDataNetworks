  A complete analysis of the consequences of introducing a set of holonomic
gauge fixing constraints (to fix the dynamics) into a singular Lagrangian is
performed. It is shown in general that the dynamical system originated from the
reduced Lagrangian erases all the information regarding the first class
constraints of the original theory, but retains its second class. It is proved
that even though the reduced Lagrangian can be singular, it never possesses any
gauge freedom. As an application, the example of $n \cdot A = 0$ gauges in
electromagnetism is treated in full detail.
