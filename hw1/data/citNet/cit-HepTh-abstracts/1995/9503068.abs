  In a recent paper \cite{[Good1]} Good postulated new rules of quantization,
one of the major features of which is that the quantum evolution of the wave
function is always given by ordinary differential equations. In this paper we
analyse the proposal in some detail and discuss its viability and its
relationship with the standard quantum theory. As a byproduct, a simple
derivation of the `mass spectrum' for the Klein-Gordon field is presented, but
it is also shown that there is a complete additional spectrum of negative
`masses'. Finally, two major reasons are presented against the viability of
this alternative proposal: a) It does not lead to the correct energy spectrum
for the hydrogen atom. b) For field models, the standard quantum theory cannot
be recovered from this alternative description.
