  This is a review of irrational conformal field theory, which includes
rational conformal field theory as a small subspace. Central topics of the
review include the Virasoro master equation, its solutions and the dynamics of
irrational conformal field theory. Discussion of the dynamics includes the
generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations on the sphere, the corresponding
heat-like systems on the torus and the generic world- sheet action of
irrational conformal field theory.
