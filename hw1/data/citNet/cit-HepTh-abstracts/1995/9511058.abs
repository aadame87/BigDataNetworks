  Recent work initiated by Strominger has lead to a consistent physical
interpretation of certain types of transitions between different string vacua.
These transitions, discovered several years ago, involve singular conifold
configurations which connect distinct Calabi-Yau manifolds. In this paper we
discuss a number of aspects of conifold transitions pertinent to both
worldsheet and spacetime mirror symmetry. It is shown that the mirror transform
based on fractional transformations allows an extension of the mirror map to
conifold boundary points of the moduli space of weighted Calabi-Yau manifolds.
The conifold points encountered in the mirror context are not amenable to an
analysis via the original splitting constructions. We describe the first
examples of such nonsplitting conifold transitions, which turn out to connect
the known web of Calabi-Yau spaces to new regions of the collective moduli
space. We then generalize the splitting conifold transition to weighted
manifolds and describe a class of connections between the webs of ordinary and
weighted projective Calabi-Yau spaces. Combining these two constructions we
find evidence for a dual analog of conifold transitions in heterotic N$=$2
compactifications on K3$\times $T$^2$ and in particular describe the first
conifold transition of a Calabi-Yau manifold whose heterotic dual has been
identified by Kachru and Vafa. We furthermore present a special type of
conifold transition which, when applied to certain classes of Calabi-Yau K3
fibrations, preserves the fiber structure.
