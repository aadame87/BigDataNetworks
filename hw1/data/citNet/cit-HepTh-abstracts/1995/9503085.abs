The dynamical behaviour of domain boundaries between different realizations of
the vacuum of scalar fields with spontaneously broken phases is investigated.
They correspond to zero-modes of the Goldstone fields, moving with the speed of
light, and turn out to be accompanied by strongly oscillating gravitational
fields. In certain space-time topologies this leads to a quantization condition
for the symmetry breaking scale in terms of the Planck mass.
