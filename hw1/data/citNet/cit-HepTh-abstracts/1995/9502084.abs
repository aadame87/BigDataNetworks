Title: QUANTUM CORRECTIONS AND EXTREMAL BLACK HOLES
Authors: G. Alejandro, F.D. Mazzitelli and C. N\'u\~nez
Comments: 12 pages, LaTex, no figures. We have improved the main argument
  leading to the non-existence of an extremal black hole in the quantum theory

  We consider static solutions of two dimensional dilaton gravity models as toy
laboratories to address the question of the final fate of black holes. A non
perturbative correction to the CGHS potential term is shown to lead classically
to an extremal black hole geometry, thus providing a plausible solution to
Hawking evaporation paradox. However, the full quantum theory does not admit an
extremal solution.
