  We begin an investigation of supersymmetric theories based on exceptional
groups. The flat directions are most easily parameterized using their
correspondence with gauge invariant polynomials. Symmetries and holomorphy
tightly constrain the superpotentials, but due to multiple gauge invariants
other techniques are needed for their full determination. We give an explicit
treatment of $G_2$ and find gaugino condensation for $N_f\leq 2$, and an
instanton generated superpotential for $N_f=3$. The analogy with $SU(N_c)$
gauge theories continues with modified and unmodified quantum moduli spaces for
$N_f=4$ and $N_f=5$ respectively, and a non-Abelian Coulomb phase for
$N_f\geq6$. Electric variables suffice to describe this phase over the full
range of $N_f$. The appendix gives a self-contained introduction to $G_2$ and
its invariant tensors.
