  It is shown that extremal magnetic black hole solutions of N = 2 supergravity
coupled to vector multiplets $X^\Lambda$ with a generic holomorphic
prepotential $F(X^\Lambda)$ can be described as supersymmetric solitons which
interpolate between maximally symmetric limiting solutions at spatial infinity
and the horizon. A simple exact solution is found for the special case that the
ratios of the $X^\Lambda$ are real, and it is seen that the logarithm of the
conformal factor of the spatial metric equals the Kahler potential on the
vector multiplet moduli space. Several examples are discussed in detail.
