  In this paper we present a detailed study of the quantum conservation laws
for Toda field theories defined on the half plane in the presence of a boundary
perturbation. We show that total derivative terms added to the currents, while
irrelevant at the classical level, become important at the quantum level and in
general modify significantly the quantum boundary conservation. We consider the
first nontrivial higher--spin currents for the simply laced $a^{(1)}_n $ Toda
theories: we find that the spin--three current leads to a quantum conserved
charge only if the boundary potential is appropriately redefined through a
finite renormalization. Contrary to the expectation we demonstrate instead that
at spin four the classical symmetry does not survive quantization and we
suspect that this feature will persist at higher--spin levels. Finally we
examine the first nontrivial conservations at spin four for the $d^{(2)}_3$ and
$c^{(1)}_2$ nonsimply laced Toda theories. In these cases the addition of total
derivative terms to the bulk currents is necessary but sufficient to ensure the
existence of corresponding quantum exact conserved charges.
