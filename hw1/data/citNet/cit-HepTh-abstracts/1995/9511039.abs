Title: From the Poincar\'e-Cartan form to a Gerstenhaber algebra of Poisson

  We review the recent generalization of the basic structures of classical
analytical mechanics to field theory within the framework of the De Donder-Weyl
(DW) covariant canonical theory. We start from the Poincar\'e-Cartan form and
construct the analogue of the symplectic form -- the polysymplectic form of
degree n+1, where n is the dimension of the space-time. The dynamical variables
are represented by differential forms and the polysymplectic form leads to the
definition of the Poisson brackets on forms. The Poisson brackets equip the
exterior algebra of dynamical variables with a structure of a "higher-order"
Gerstenhaber algebra. We also briefly outline a possible approach to field
quantization which proceeds from the DW Hamiltonian formalism and the Poisson
brackets of forms.
