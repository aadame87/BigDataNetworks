  A particular dispersive generalization of long water wave equation in $1+1$
dimensions, which is important in the study of matrix models without scaling
limit, known as two--Boson (TB) equation, as well as the associated hierarchy
has been derived from the zero curvature condition on the gauge group
$SL(2,R)\otimes U(1)$. The supersymmetric extension of the two--Boson (sTB)
hierarchy has similarly been derived from the zero curvature condition
associated with the gauge supergroup $OSp(2|2)$. Topological algebras arise
naturally as the second Hamiltonian structure of these classical integrable
systems, indicating a close relationship of these models with 2d topological
field theories.
