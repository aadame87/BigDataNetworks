  Sufficiently large seeds for generating the observed (inter)galactic magnetic
fields emerge naturally in string cosmology from the amplification of
electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations due to a dynamical dilaton background. The
success of the mechanism depends crucially on two features of the so-called
pre-big-bang scenario, an early epoch of dilaton-driven inflation at very small
coupling, and a sufficiently long intermediate stringy era preceding the
standard radiation-dominated evolution.
