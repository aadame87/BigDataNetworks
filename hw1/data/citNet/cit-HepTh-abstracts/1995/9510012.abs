  In this paper the stabilization of 2D quantum Gravity by branching
interactions is considered. The perturbative expansion and the first
nonperturbative term of the stabilized model are the same than the unbounded
matrix model which define pure Gravity, but it has new nonperturbative effects
that survives in the continuum limit.
