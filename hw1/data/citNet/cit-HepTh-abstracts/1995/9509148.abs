  This talk is divided into two parts. The first part reviews some of the
duality relationships between superstring theories. These relationships are
interpreted as providing evidence for the existence of a unique underlying
fundamental theory. The second part describes my recent work on the SL(2,Z)
duality group of the type IIB superstring theory in ten dimensions and its
interpretation in terms of a possible theory of supermembranes in eleven
dimensions.
