  We present one loop boundary reflection matrix for $d_4^{(1)}$ Toda field
theory defined on a half line with the Neumann boundary condition. This result
demonstrates a nontrivial cancellation of non-meromorphic terms which are
present when the model has a particle spectrum with more than one mass. Using
this result, we determine uniquely the exact boundary reflection matrix which
turns out to be \lq non-minimal' if we assume the strong-weak coupling \lq
duality'.
