  Pure Yang-Mills theories on the $S_1\times R$ cylinder are quantized in
light-cone gauge $A_-=0$ by means of ${\bf equal-time}$ commutation relations.
Positive and negative frequency components are excluded from the ``physical"
Hilbert space by imposing Gauss' law in a weak sense. Zero modes, related to
the winding on the cylinder, provide non trivial topological variables of the
theory. A Wilson loop with light-like sides is studied: in the abelian case it
can be exactly computed obtaining the expected area result, whereas
difficulties are pointed out in non abelian cases.
