  Exact expressions of the boundary state and the form factors of the Ising
model are used to derive differential equations for the one-point functions of
the energy and magnetization operators of the model in the presence of a
boundary magnetic field. We also obtain explicit formulas for the massless
limit of the one-point and two-point functions of the energy operator.
