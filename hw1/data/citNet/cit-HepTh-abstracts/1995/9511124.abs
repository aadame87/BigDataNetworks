  After a brief historical comment on the study of BRS(or BRST) symmetry , we
discuss the quantization of gauge theories with Gribov copies. A path integral
with BRST symmetry can be formulated by summing the Gribov-type copies in a
very specific way if the functional correspondence between $\tau$ and the gauge
parameter $\omega$ defined by $\tau (x) = f( A_{\mu}^{\omega}(x))$ is
``globally single valued'', where $f( A_{\mu}^{\omega}(x)) = 0 $ specifies the
gauge condition. As an example of the theory which satisfies this criterion, we
comment on a soluble gauge model with Gribov-type copies recently analyzed by
Friedberg, Lee, Pang and Ren. We also comment on a possible connection of the
dynamical instability of BRST symmetry with the Gribov problem on the basis of
an index notion.
