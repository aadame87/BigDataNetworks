\\
  From the point of view of topology we study the induced representation
technique which E. Wigner proposed in 1939. We comment on the gauge structure
in the induced representation technique and construc the explicit form of the
gauge fields. The topological results ofour study are applied to quantum
mechanics on a d-dimensional sphere and its path integral is formulated.
