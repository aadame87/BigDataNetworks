Functional determinants for the scalar Laplacian on spherical caps and slices,
flat balls, shells and generalised cylinders are evaluated in two, three and
four dimensions using conformal techniques. Both Dirichlet and Robin boundary
conditions are allowed for. Some effects of non-smooth boundaries are
discussed; in particular the 3-hemiball and the 3-hemishell are considered. The
edge and vertex contributions to the $C_{3/2}$ coefficient are examined.
