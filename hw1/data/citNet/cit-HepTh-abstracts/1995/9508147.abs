  An ansatz is presented for a possible non-associative deformation of the
standard Yang-Mills type gauge theories. An explicit algebraic structure for
the deformed gauge symmetry is put forward and the resulting gauge theory
developed. The non-associative deformation is constructed in such a way that an
apparently associative Lie algebraic structure is retained modulo a closure
problem for the generators. It is this failure to close which leads to new
physics in the model as manifest in the gauge field kinetic term in the
resulting Lagrangian. A possible connection between this model and quantum
group gauge theories is also investigated.
