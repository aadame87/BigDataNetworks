The method of differential regularization is applied to calculate explicitly
the one-loop effective potential of a bosonized Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model
consisting of scalar and pseudoscalar fields. The regularization scheme
independent relation for the $\sigma$ mass sum rule is obtained. This method
can be readily applied to extended NJL models with gauge fields.
