Title: Planckian Scattering and Shock Wave Mixing in General Relativity and
  Dilaton Gravity
Author: Parthasarathi Majumdar
Comments: 26 pages, no figures, World Scientific Tex macros included. Based on
  invited talk delivered at the Conference on Planck Scale Physics held during
  December 12-21, 1994 at Puri, India.

  Point particle scattering at Planckian centre-of-mass (cm) energies and low
fixed momentum transfers, occurring due both to electromagnetic and
gravitational interactions, is surveyed, with particular emphasis on the novel
features occurring in electromagnetic charge-monopole scattering. The issue of
possible mixing of the shock waves occurring due to both kinds of interactions
is then addressed within the framework of Einsteinian general relativity and
the dilatonic extension suggested by string theory.
