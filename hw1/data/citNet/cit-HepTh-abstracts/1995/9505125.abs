  We review developments in the world-sheet action formulation of the generic
irrational conformal field theory, including the non-linear and the linearized
forms of the action. These systems form a large class of spin-two gauged WZW
actions which exhibit exotic gravitational couplings. Integrating out the
gravitational field, we also speculate on a connection with sigma models.
