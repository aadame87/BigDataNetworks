A review is given of the presymplectic approach to relativistic physical
systems and of the determination of their Dirac's observables. After
relativistic mechanics and Nambu string, the Dirac's observables of Yang-Mills
theory with fermions are given for the case of massless vector bosons (like in
QED). A Dirac-Yukawa-like intrinsic ultraviolet cut-off is identified from the
study of the covariantization of Hamiltonian classical field theory in the
Dirac-Tomonaga-Schwinger sens. The implications fo the solution of the
constraints of tetrad gravity are shown.
