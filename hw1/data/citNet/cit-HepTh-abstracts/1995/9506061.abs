  The coupling, in a non-standard way, of a bosonic string theory with a
dilaton and antisymmetric fields is investigated. By integrating over the
antisymmetric fields, a Coulomb-like interaction term is generated. The static
potential of a theory of this kind is obtained from the corresponding non-local
zeta function, in some approximation. An interpretation of the static potential
as a type of non-local Casimir effect is given.
