  Many two-dimensional classical field theories have hidden symmetries that
form an infinite-dimensional algebra. For those examples that correspond to
effective descriptions of compactified superstring theories, the duality group
is expected to be a large discrete subgroup of the hidden symmetry group. With
this motivation, we explore the hidden symmetries of principal chiral models
and symmetric space models.
