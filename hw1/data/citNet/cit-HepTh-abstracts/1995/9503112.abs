We examine the two-point correlation functions of the fields exp(i$\alpha\Phi$)
in the sine-Gordon theory at all values of the coupling constant $\hat\beta$.
Using conformal perturbation theory, we write down explicit integral
expressions for every order of the short distance expansion. Using a
novel technique analagous to dimensional regularisation, we evaluate these
integrals for the first few orders finding expressions in terms of generalised
hypergeometric functions. From these derived expressions, we examine the
limiting forms at the points where the sine-Gordon theory maps onto a doubled
Ising and the Gross-Neveu SU(2) models. In this way we recover the known
expansions of the spin and disorder fields about criticality in the Ising model
and the well known Kosterlitz-Thouless flows in the Gross-Neveu SU(2) model.
