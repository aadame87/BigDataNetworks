  We construct new $U_q(a^{(2)}_{2n-1})$ and $U_q(e^{(2)}_6)$ invariant
$R$-matrices and comment on the general construction of $R$-matrices for
twisted algebras. We use the former to construct $S$-matrices for $b^{(1)}_n$
affine Toda solitons and their bound states, identifying the lowest breathers
with the $b^{(1)}_n$ particles.
