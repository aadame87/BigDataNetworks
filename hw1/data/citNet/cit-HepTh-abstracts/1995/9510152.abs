  Utilizing techniques suggested by the recently obtained construction of
off-shell spinning particles, we propose the arbitrary $N$-extension of
supersymmetry for the KdV system. It is further suggested that the ${\aleph}_0$
extension for the SKdV system provides a paradigm for {\underline {all}}
supersymmetric completely integrable systems.
