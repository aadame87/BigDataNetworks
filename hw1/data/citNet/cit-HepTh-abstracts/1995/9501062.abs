Authors: Zhan-Ning Hu
Report-no: AS-ITP-95-01

Using the restricted star-triangle relation, it is shown that the $N$-state
spin integrable model on a three-dimensional lattice with spins interacting
round each elementary cube of the lattice proposed by Mangazeev, Sergeev and
Stroganov is a particular case of the Bazhanov-Baxter model.
