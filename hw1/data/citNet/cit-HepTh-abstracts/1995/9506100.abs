  We investigate the generalized Gross-Neveu model using the discretized light
cone quantization and we find that the vacuum of the bare theory is {\sl non}
trivial in presence of vectorial current coupling when the simplest and most
natural form of quantum constraints is used. Nevertheless the vacuum of the
renormalized theory is trivial. In the thermodynamic the Bethe-Salpiter
equations which are obtained contain all the terms needed to make them finite.
