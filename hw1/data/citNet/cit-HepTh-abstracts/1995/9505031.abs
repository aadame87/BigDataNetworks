  We apply the time-dependent variational principle of Balian and V\'en\'eroni
to the $ \Phi^4$ theory. An appropriate parametrization for the variational
objects allows us to write coupled dynamical equations from which we derive
approximations for the two-time correlation functions involving two, three or
four field operators.
