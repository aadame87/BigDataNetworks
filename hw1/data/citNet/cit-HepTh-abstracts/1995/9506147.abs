  We discuss the $2+1$ dimensional Abelian Higgs model coupled to $N=2$
supergravity. We construct the supercharge algebra and, from it, we show that
the mass of classical static solutions is bounded from below by the topological
charge. As it happens in the global case, half of the supersymmetry is broken
when the bound is attained and Bogomol'nyi equations, resulting from the
unbroken supersymmetry, hold. These equations, which correspond to gravitating
vortices, include a first order self-duality equation whose integrability
condition reproduces the Einstein equation.
