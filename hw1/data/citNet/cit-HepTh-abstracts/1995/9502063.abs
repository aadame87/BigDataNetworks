Title: On tau-functions of Zakharov-Shabat and other matrix hierarchies of
  integrable equations
Author: L.A. Dickey
Comments: 22 pages, LaTeX

  Matrix hierarchies are: multi-component KP, general Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) and
its special cases, e.g., AKNS. The ZS comprises all integrable systems having a
form of zero-curvature equations with rational dependence of matrices on a
spectral parameter. The notion of a $\tau$-function is introduced here in the
most general case along with formulas linking $\tau$-functions with wave Baker
functions. The method originally invented by Sato et al. for the KP hierarchy
is used. This method goes immediately from definitions and does not require any
assumption about the character of a solution, being the most general. Applied
to the matrix hierarchies, it involves considerable sophistication. The paper
is self-contained and does not expect any special prerequisite from a reader.
