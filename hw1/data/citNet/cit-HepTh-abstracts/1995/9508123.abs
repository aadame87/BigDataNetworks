  We consider a relativistic strongly interacting Bose gas. The interaction is
manifested in the off-shellness of the equilibrium distribution. The equation
of state that we obtain for such a gas has the properties of a realistic
equation of state of strongly interacting matter, i.e., at low temperature it
agrees with the one suggested by Shuryak for hadronic matter, while at high
temperature it represents the equation of state of an ideal ultrarelativistic
Stefan-Boltzmann gas, implying a phase transition to an effectively weakly
interacting phase.
