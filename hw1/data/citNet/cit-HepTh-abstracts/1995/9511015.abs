  Based on a model of the d=3 SU(2) pure gauge theory vacuum as a
monopole-vortex condensate, we give a quantitative (if model-dependent)
estimate of the relation between the string tension and a gauge-invariant
measure of the Chern-Simons susceptibility, due to vortex linkages, in the
absence of a Chern-Simons term in the action. We also give relations among
these quantities and the vacuum energy and gauge-boson mass. Both the
susceptibility and the string tension come from the same physics: The topology
of linking, twisting, and writhing of closed vortex strings. The closed-vortex
string is described via a complex scalar field theory whose action has a
precisely-specified functional form, inferred from previous work giving the
exact form of a gauge-theory effective potential at low momentum. Applications
to high-T phenomena, including B+L anomalous violation, are mentioned.
