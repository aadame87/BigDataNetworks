  We present a formulation of $N=1,D=10$ Supergravity--Super--Maxwell theory in
superspace in which the graviphoton can be described by a 2--form $B_2$ or a
6--form $B_6$, the photon by a 1--form $A_1$ or a 7--form $A_7$ and the dilaton
by a scalar $\varphi$ or an 8--form $\varphi_8$, the supercurvatures of these
fields being related by duality. Duality interchanges Bianchi identities and
equations of motion for each of the three couples of fields. This construction
envisages the reformulation of $D=10$ Supergravity, involving 7--forms as gauge
fields, conjectured by Schwarz and Sen, which, upon toroidal compactification
to four dimensions, gives the manifestly $SL(2,R)_S$ invariant form of the
heterotic string effective action.
