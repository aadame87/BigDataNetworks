  The formalism for a non-abelian pure gauge theory in (2+1) dimensions has
recently been derived within Discretized Light-Cone Quantization, restricting
to the lowest {\it transverse} momentum gluons. It is argued why this model can
be a paradigm for full QCD. The physical vacuum becomes non-trivial even in
light-cone quantization. The approach is brought here to tractable form by
suppressing by hand both the dynamical gauge and the constraint zero mode, and
by performing a Tamm-Dancoff type Fock-space truncation. Within that model the
Hamiltonian is diagonalized numerically, yielding mass spectra and
wavefunctions of the glue-ball states. We find that only color singlets have a
stable and discrete bound state spectrum. The connection with confinement is
discussed. The structure function of the gluons has a shape like $ [{x(1-x)}]
^{1\over 3} $. The existence of the continuum limit is verified by deriving a
coupled set of integral equations.
