  By casting the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations of an SU(2) theory in the form of
the Ernst equations of general relativity, it is shown how the known exact
solutions of general relativity can be used to give similiar solutions for
Yang-Mills theory. Thus all the known exact solutions of general relativity
with axial symmetry (e.g. the Kerr metric, the Tomimatsu-Sato metric) have
Yang-Mills equivalents. In this paper we only examine in detail the Kerr-like
solution. It will be seen that this solution has surfaces where the gauge and
scalar fields become infinite, which correspond to the infinite redshift
surfaces of the normal Kerr solution. It is speculated that this feature may be
connected with the confinement mechanism since any particle which carries an
SU(2) color charge would tend to become trapped once it passes these surfaces.
Unlike the Kerr solution, our solution apparently does not have any intrinsic
angular momentum, but rather appears to give the non-Abelian field
configuration associated with concentric shells of color charge.
