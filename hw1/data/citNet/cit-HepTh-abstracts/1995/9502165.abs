  We give an integral representation of solutions of the elliptic
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations for arbitrary simple Lie algebras. If
the level is a positive integer, we obtain formulas for conformal blocks of the
WZW model on a torus. The asymptotics of our solutions at critical level gives
eigenfunctions of Euler-Calogero-Moser integrable $N$-body systems. As a
by-product, we obtain some remarkable integral identities involving classical
theta functions.
