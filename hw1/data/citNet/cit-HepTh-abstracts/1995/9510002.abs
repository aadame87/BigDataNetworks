  A pseudoclassical theory of Weyl particle in the space--time dimensions
$D=2n$ is constructed. The canonical quantization of that pseudoclassical
theory is carried out and it results in the theory of the $D=2n$ dimensional
Weyl particle in the Foldy--Wouthuysen representation. A quantum mechanics of
the neutral Weyl particle in even--dimensional space--time is suggested and the
connection of this theory with the theory of Mayorana--Weyl particle in QFT is
discussed for $D=10$.
