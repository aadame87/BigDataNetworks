  The Thirring model and various generalizations of it are analyzed in detail.
The four-Fermi interaction modifies the equation of state. Chemical potentials
and twisted boundary conditions both result in complex fermionic determinants
which are analyzed. The non-minimal coupling to gravity does deform the
conformal algebra which in particular contains the minimal models. We compute
the central charges, conformal weights and finite size effects. For the gauged
model we derive the partition functions and the explicit expression for the
chiral condensate at finite temperature and curvature. The Bosonization in
compact curved space-times is also investigated.
