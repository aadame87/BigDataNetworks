  In this paper the classical limit of relativistic transport theories for spin
1/2 fermions is examined through a comparison with the classical kinetic theory
derived from N=1 supersymmetric classical mechanics. The conclusion is that in
the classical limit spindensities, i.e. the axial-vector contribution to the
relativistic Wigner-function, vanishes and dipole-densities, i.e. the
spin-tensor contributions to the relativistic Wigner function, may survive.
