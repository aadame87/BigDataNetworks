  We present the hyper-elliptic curve describing the moduli space of the N=2
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the $G_2$ gauge group. The exact
monodromies and the dyon spectrum of the theory are determined. It is verified
that the recently proposed solitonic equation is also satisfied by our
solution.
