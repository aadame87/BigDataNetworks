  Owing to its lack of derivability, the dissipative anomaly operator appearing
in the theory of turbulence without pressure recently proposed by Polyakov
appears to be quite elusive. In particular, we give arguments that seem to lead
to the conclusion that an anomaly in the first equation of the sequence of
conservation laws cannot be {\it a priori} excluded.
