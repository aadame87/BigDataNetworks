  We investigate the gauging of conformal algebras with relations between the
generators. We treat the $W_{5/2}$--algebra as a specific example. We show that
the gauge-algebra is in general reducible with an infinite number of stages. We
show how to construct the BV-extended action, and hence the classical BRST
charge. An important conclusion is that this can always be done in terms of the
generators of the $W$--algebra only, that is, independent of the realisation.
The present treatment is still purely classical, but already enables us to
learn more about reducible gauge algebras and the BV-formalism.
