In the present article we analyze the problem of a relativistic Dirac electron
in the presence of a combination of a Coulomb field, a $1/r$ scalar potential
as well as a Dirac magnetic monopole and an Aharonov-Bohm potential. Using the
algebraic method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation expressed in
the local rotating diagonal gauge is completely separated in spherical
coordinates, and exact solutions are obtained. We compute the energy spectrum
and analyze how it depends on the intensity of the Aharonov-Bohm and the
magnetic monopole strengths.
