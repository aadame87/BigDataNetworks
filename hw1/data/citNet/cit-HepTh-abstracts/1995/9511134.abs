  We study the model of (2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic fermions in a random
non-Abelian gauge potential at criticality. The exact solution shows that the
operator expansion contains a conserved current - a generator of a continuous
symmetry. The presence of this operator changes the operator product expansion
and gives rise to logarithmic contributions to the correlation functions at the
critical point. We calculate the distribution function of the local density of
states in this model and find that it follows the famous log-normal law.
