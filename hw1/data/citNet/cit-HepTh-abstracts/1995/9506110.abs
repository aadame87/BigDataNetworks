  We collect further evidence for the proposed duality between $N=2$ heterotic
and type II string vacua in a specific model suggested by Kachru and Vafa. In
the gauge sector the previous analysis is extended; it is further shown that
the duality also holds for the one--loop gravitational couplings to the vector
multiplets.
