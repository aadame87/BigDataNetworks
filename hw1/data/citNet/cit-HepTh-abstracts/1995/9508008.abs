  We present a real space renormalization-group map for probabilities of random
walks on a hierarchical lattice. From this, we study the asymptotic behavior of
the end-to-end distance of a weakly self- avoiding random walk (SARW) that
penalizes the (self-)intersection of two random walks in dimension four on the
hierarchical lattice.
