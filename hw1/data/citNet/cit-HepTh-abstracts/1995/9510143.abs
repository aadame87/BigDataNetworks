  Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard (KZB) equation on an elliptic curve with a
marked point is derived by the classical Hamiltonian reduction and further
quantization. We consider classical Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundle to
the loop group $L(GL(N,{\bf C}))$ extended by the shift operators, to be
related to the elliptic module. After the reduction we obtain the Hamiltonian
system on cotangent bundle to the moduli of holomorphic principle bundles and
the elliptic module. It is a particular example of generalized Hitchin systems
(GHS), which are defined as hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles to the
moduli of holomorphic bundles and to the moduli of curves. They are extensions
of the Hitchin systems by the inclusion the moduli of curves. In contrast with
the Hitchin systems the algebra of integrals are noncommutative on GHS. We
discuss the quantization procedure in our example. The quantization of the
quadratic integral leads to the KZB equation. We present the explicite form of
higher quantum Hitchin integrals, which upon on reducing from GHS phase space
to the Hitchin phase space gives a particular example of the Belinson-Drinfeld
commutative algebra of differential operators on the moduli of holomorphic
bundles.
