We obtain a bilocal classical field theory as the large $N$ limit of the chiral
Gross--Neveu (or non--abelian Thirring) model. Exact classical solutions that
describe topological solitons are obtained. It is shown that their mass
spectrum agrees with the large $N$ limit of the spectrum of the chiral
Gross--Neveu model.
