Title: From Boundaries To Conditions Over Superspace
Authors: Zheng Yin
Comments: 25 pages
Report-no: CERN-TH/2002-318
\\
  N=1 and 2 superconformal boundary conditions are shown to be the consequence
of a boundary on the worldsheet superspace with positive codimension in the
anticommuting subspace. In addition to the well-known boundary conditions, I
also find two new infinite series of N=2 boundary states. Their free field
realizations are given. A self-contained development of 2d superspace leads to
new perspectives on this subject.
