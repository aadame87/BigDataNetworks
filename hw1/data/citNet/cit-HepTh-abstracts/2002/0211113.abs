Title: Superspace Formulation of 4D Higher Spin Gauge Theory
Authors: J. Engquist, E. Sezgin and P. Sundell

\\
  Interacting AdS_4 higher spin gauge theories with N \geq 1 supersymmetry so
far have been formulated as constrained systems of differential forms living in
a twistor extension of 4D spacetime. Here we formulate the minimal N=1 theory
in superspace, leaving the internal twistor space intact. Remarkably, the
superspace constraints have the same form as those defining the theory in
ordinary spacetime. This construction generalizes straightforwardly to higher
spin gauge theories N>1 supersymmetry.
