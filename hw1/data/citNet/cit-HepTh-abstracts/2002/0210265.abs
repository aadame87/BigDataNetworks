  We determine the Killing spinors for a class of magnetic brane solutions with
Minkowski worldvolume of the theory of AdS Einstein Maxwell theories in d
dimensions. We also obtain curved magnetic brane solutions with Ricci-flat
worldvolumes. If we demand that the curved brane solution admits Killing
spinors, then its worldvolume must admit parallel spinors. Classes of
Ricci-flat worldvolumes admitting parallel spinors are discussed.
