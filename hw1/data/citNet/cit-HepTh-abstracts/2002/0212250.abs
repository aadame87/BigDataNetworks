  An indication for the existence of a collective Myers solution in the
non-abelian D0-brane Born-Infeld action is the presence of a tachyonic mode in
fluctuations around the standard diagonal background. We show that this
computation for non-abelian D0-branes in curved space has the geometric
interpretation of computing the eigenvalues of the geodesic deviation operator
for U(N)-valued coordinates. On general grounds one therefore expects a
geometric Myers effect in regions of sufficiently negative curvature. We
confirm this by explicit computations for non-abelian D0-branes on a sphere and
a hyperboloid. For the former the diagonal solution is stable, but not so for
the latter. We conclude by showing that near the horizon of a Schwarzschild
black hole one also finds a tachyonic mode in the fluctuation spectrum,
signaling the possibility of a near-horizon gravitationally induced Myers
effect.
