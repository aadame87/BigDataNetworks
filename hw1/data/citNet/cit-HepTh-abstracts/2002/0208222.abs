  Three closely related issues will be discussed. Magnetic quarks having
non-Abelian charges have been found recently to appear as the dominant infrared
degrees of freedom in some vacua of softly broken N=2 supersymmetric QCD with
SU(n_c) gauge group. Their condensation upon N=1 perturbation causes
confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking. We argue that these magnetic
quarks can be naturally related to the semiclassical non-Abelian monopoles of
the type first discussed by Goddard, Nuyts, Olive and E. Weinberg. We discuss
also general properties of non-Abelian vortices and discuss their relevance to
the confinement in QCD. Finally, calculation by Douglas and Shenker of the
tension ratios for vortices of different N-alities in the softly broken N=2
supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, is carried to the second order in the
adjoint multiplet mass. A correction to the ratios violating the sine formula
is found, showing that the latter is not a universal quantity.
