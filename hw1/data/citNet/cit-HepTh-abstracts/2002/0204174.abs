  Based on the observation that $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_k$ orbifolds have a maximal
supersymmetric PP-wave limit, the description of strings in PP-waves in terms
of ${\cal N}=2$ quiver gauge theories is presented. We consider two different,
small and large $k$, cases and show that the operators in the gauge theory
which correspond to stringy excitations are labelled by two integers, the
excitation and winding or momentum numbers. For the large $k$ case, the
relation between the space-time and worldsheet deconstructions is discussed. We
also comment on the possible duality between these two cases.
