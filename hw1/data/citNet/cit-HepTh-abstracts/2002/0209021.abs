  Through defining irreducible loop integrals (ILIs), a set of consistency
conditions for the regularized (quadratically and logarithmically) divergent
ILIs are obtained to maintain the generalized Ward identities of gauge
invariance in non-Abelian gauge theories. Overlapping UV divergences are
explicitly shown to be factorizable in the ILIs and be harmless via suitable
subtractions. A new regularization and renormalization method is presented in
the initial space-time dimension of the theory.
  The procedure respects unitarity and causality. Of interest, the method leads
to an infinity free renormalization and meanwhile maintains the symmetry
principles of the original theory except the intrinsic mass scale caused
conformal scaling symmetry breaking and the anomaly induced symmetry breaking.
Quantum field theories (QFTs) regularized through the new method are well
defined and governed by a physically meaningful characteristic energy scale
(CES) $M_c$ and a physically interesting sliding energy scale (SES) $\mu_s$
which can run from $\mu_s \sim M_c$ to a dynamically generated mass gap
$\mu_s=\mu_c$ or to $\mu_s =0$ in the absence of mass gap and infrared (IR)
problem.
  It is strongly indicated that the conformal scaling symmetry and its breaking
mechanism play an important role for understanding the mass gap and quark
confinement.
