  It is shown that negative tension branes in higher dimensions may lead to an
effective lower dimensional theory where the gauge-invariant vector fields
associated with the fluctuations of the metric are always massless and
localized on the brane. Explicit five-dimensional examples of this phenomenon
are provided. Furthermore, it is shown that higher dimensional gauge fields can
also be localized on these configurations with the zero mode separated from the
massive tower by a gap.
