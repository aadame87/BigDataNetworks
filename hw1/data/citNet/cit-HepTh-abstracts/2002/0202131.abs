  We consider system of Dp-branes in the presence of a nonzero B field with one
leg along brane worldvolume and the other transverse to it. We study the
corresponding supergravity solutions and show that the worldvolume theories
decouple from gravity for $p\leq 5$. Therefore these solutions provide dual
description of large N noncommutative dipole field theories. We shall only
consider those systems which preserve 8 supercharges in the branes worldvolume.
We analyze the system of M5-branes and NS5-branes in the presence of nonzero C
field and RR field with one leg along the transverse direction and the others
along the worldvolume of the brane, respectively. This could provide a new
deformation of (2,0) and little string field theories. Finally, we study the
Wilson loops using the dual gravity descriptions.
