  We construct the boundary WZNW functional for symmetry breaking D-branes on a
group manifold which are localized along a product of a number of twisted
conjugacy classes and which preserve an action of an arbitrary continuous
subgroup. These branes provide a geometric interpretation for the algebraic
formulation of constructing D-branes developed recently in hep-th/0203161. We
apply our results to obtain new symmetry breaking and non-factorizing D-branes
in the background SL(2,R) x SU(2).
