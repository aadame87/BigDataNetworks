  The equation of motion for Berkovits' WZW-like open (super)string field
theory is shown to be integrable in the sense that it can be written as the
compatibility condition ("zero-curvature condition") of some linear equations.
Employing a generalization of solution-generating techniques (the splitting and
the dressing methods), we demonstrate how to construct nonperturbative
classical configurations of both N=1 superstring and N=2 fermionic string field
theories. With and without u(n) Chan-Paton factors, various solutions of the
string field equation are presented explicitly.
