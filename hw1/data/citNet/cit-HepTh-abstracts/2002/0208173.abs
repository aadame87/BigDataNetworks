Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory on q-Quantum Spaces
Authors: Stefan Schraml

\\
  Gauge theories on q-deformed spaces are constructed using covariant
derivatives. For this purpose a ``vielbein'' is introduced, which transforms
under gauge transformations. The non-Abelian case is treated by establishing a
connection to gauge theories on commutative spaces, i.e. by a Seiberg-Witten
map. As an example we consider the Manin plane. Remarks are made concerning the
relation between covariant coordinates and covariant derivatives.
