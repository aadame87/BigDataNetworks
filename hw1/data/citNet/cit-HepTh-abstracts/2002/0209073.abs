  In this work, we pursue further consequences of a general formalism for
non-covariant gauges developed in an earlier work (hep-th/0205042). We carry
out further analysis of the additional restrictions on renormalizations noted
in that work. We use the example of the axial gauge A_3=0. We find that if
multiplicative renormalization together with ghost-decoupling is to hold, the
``prescription-term'' (that defines a prescription) cannot be chosen
arbitrarily but has to satisfy certain non-trivial conditions (over and above
those implied by the validity of power counting) arising from the WT identities
associated with the residual gauge invariance. We also give a restricted class
of solutions to these conditions.
