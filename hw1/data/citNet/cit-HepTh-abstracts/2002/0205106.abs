  We derive two families of supergravity solutions describing D-branes in the
maximally supersymmetric Hpp-wave background. The first family of solutions
corresponds to quarter-BPS D-branes. These solutions are delocalised along
certain directions transverse to the pp-wave. The second family corresponds to
the non-supersymmetric D-branes. These solutions are fully localised. A
peculiar feature of the nonsupersymmetric solutions is that gravity becomes
repulsive close to the core of the D-brane. Both families preserve the amount
of supersymmetry predicted by the D-brane probe/CFT analysis. All solutions are
written in Brinkman coordinates. To construct these kind of solutions it is
crucial to identify the coordinates in which the ansatz looks the simplest. We
argue that the natural coordinates to get the supergravity description of the
half-BPS branes are the Rosen coordinates.
