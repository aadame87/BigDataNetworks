  Properties of the rotating Kerr-Newman black hole solution allow to relate it
with spinning particles. Singularity of black hole (BH) can be regularized by a
metric deformation. In this case, as a consequence of the Einstein equations, a
material source appears in the form of a relativistically rotating
superconducting disk which replaces the former singular region. We show a
relation of the BH regularization with confinement formation. By
regularization, a phase transition occurs near the core of a charged black hole
solution: from external electrovacuum to an internal superconducting state of
matter. We discuss two models of such a kind, which demonstrate the appearance
of a baglike structure and a mechanism of confinement based on dual Dirac's
electrodynamics. First one is an approximate solution based on a supersymmetric
charged domain wall, and second is an exact solution based on nonlinear
electrodynamics.
