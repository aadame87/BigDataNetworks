  We study the extent to which the gauge symmetry of abelian Yang-Mills can be
deformed under two conditions: first, that the deformation depend on a two-form
scale. Second, that the deformation preserve supersymmetry. We show that (up to
a single parameter) the only allowed deformation is the one determined by the
star product. We then consider the supersymmetry algebra satisfied by NCYM
expressed in commutative variables. The algebra is peculiar since the
supercharges are not gauge-invariant. However, the action, expressed in
commutative variables, appears to be quadratic in fermions to all orders in
theta.
