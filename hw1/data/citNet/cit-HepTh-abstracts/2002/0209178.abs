  We construct an explicit 5-dimensional supergravity model that realizes the
"no scale" mechanism for supersymmetry breaking with no unstable moduli.
Supersymmetry is broken by a constant superpotential localized on a brane, and
the radion is stabilized by Casimir energy from supergravity and massive
hypermultiplets. If the standard model gauge and matter fields are localized on
a brane, then visible sector supersymmetry breaking is dominated by gravity
loops and flavor-violating hypermultiplet loops, and gaugino masses are smaller
than scalar masses. We present a realistic model in which the the standard
model gauge fields are partly localized. In this model visible sector
supersymmetry breaking is naturally gaugino mediated, while masses of the
gravitino and gravitational moduli are larger than the weak scale.
