Title: Exact Solutions in Open Bosonic String Field Theory and Marginal
  Deformation in CFT

  In this paper we continue our study of the exact solution in open bosonic
string field theory. We present solution in the string field theory defined on
the background corresponding to the boundary conformal field theory ($BCFT$)
describing D25-brane. We then show that the string field theory that arises
from the original one by an expansion about this classical solution can be
interpreted as the string field theory defined on the new $BCFT''$ that is
related to the original $BCFT$ by marginal boundary interaction. In particular
we will show that this approach can be useful for the study of the exact time
dependent solution in the open bosonic string field theory.
