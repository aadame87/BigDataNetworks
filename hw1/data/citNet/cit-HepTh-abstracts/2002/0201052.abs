  Using the recently discovered Clifford statistics we propose a simple model
for the grand canonical ensemble of the carriers in the theory of fractional
quantum Hall effect. The model leads to a temperature limit associated with the
permutational degrees of freedom of such an ensemble.
 We also relate Schur's theory of projective representations of the permutation
groups to physics, and remark on possible extensions of the second quantization
procedure.
