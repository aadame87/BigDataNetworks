  We consider a model of brane world gravity in the context of non-conformal
non-SUSY matter. In particular we modify the earlier strong coupling solution
to the glueball spectrum in an $AdS^7$ Black Hole by introducing a
Randall-Sundrum Planck brane as a UV cut-off. The consequence is a new
normalizable zero mass tensor state, which gives rise to an effective
Einstein-Hilbert theory of gravity, with exponentially small corrections set by
the mass gap to the discrete glueball spectrum. However the simplest
microscopic theory for the Planck brane is found to have a tachyonic
instability in the radion mode.
