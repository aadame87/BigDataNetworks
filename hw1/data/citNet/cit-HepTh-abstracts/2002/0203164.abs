  We argue that the gauge theory dual to the Type IIB string theory in
ten-dimensional pp-wave background can be thought to `live' on an {\it
Euclidean} subspace spanning four of the eight transverse coordinates. We then
show that light-cone time evolution of the string is identifiable as the RG
flow of the gauge theory -- a relation facilitating `holography' of the pp-wave
background. The `holography' reorganizes the dual gauge theory into theories
defined over Hilbert subspaces of fixed R-charge. The reorganization breaks the
SO(4,2)$\times$SO(6) symmetry to a maximal subgroup SO(4)$\times$ SO(4)
spontaneously. We argue that the low-energy string modes may be regarded as
Goldstone modes resulting from such symmetry breaking pattern.
