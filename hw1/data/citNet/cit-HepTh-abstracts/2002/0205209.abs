  We study the cosmology induced on a brane probing a warped throat region in a
Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory. For the case of a BPS
D3-brane probing the Klebanov-Strassler warped deformed conifold, the cosmology
described by a suitable brane observer is a bouncing, spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with time-varying Newton's constant, which
passes smoothly from a contracting to an expanding phase. In the
Klebanov-Tseytlin approximation to the Klebanov-Strassler solution the
cosmology would end with a big crunch singularity. In this sense, the warped
deformed conifold provides a string theory resolution of a spacelike
singularity in the brane cosmology. The four-dimensional effective action
appropriate for a brane observer is a simple scalar-tensor theory of gravity.
In this description of the physics, a bounce is possible because the relevant
energy-momentum tensor can classically violate the null energy condition.
