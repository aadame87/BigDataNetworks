  We consider a supersymmetric extension of quantum gauge theory based on a
vector multiplet containing supersymmetric partners of spin 3/2 for the vector
fields. The constructions of the model follows closely the usual construction
of gauge models in the Epstein-Glaser framework for perturbative field theory.
Accordingly, all the arguments are completely of quantum nature without
reference to a classical supersymmetric theory. As an application we consider
the supersymmetric electroweak theory. The resulting self-couplings of the
gauge bosons agree with the standard model up to a divergence.
