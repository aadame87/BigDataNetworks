  Coupling fundamental quarks to QCD in the dual string representation
corresponds to adding the open string sector. Flavors therefore should be
represented by space-time filling D-branes in the dual 5d closed string
background. This requires several interesting properties of D-branes in AdS.
D-branes have to be able to end in thin air in order to account for massive
quarks, which only live in the UV region. They must come in distinct sets,
representing the chiral global symmetry, with a bifundamental field playing the
role of the chiral condensate. We show that these expectations are born out in
several supersymmetric examples. To analyze most of these properties it is not
necessary to go beyond the probe limit in which one neglects the backreaction
of the flavor D-branes.
