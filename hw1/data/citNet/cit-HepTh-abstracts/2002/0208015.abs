  We consider giant graviton probes of 11-dimensional supergravity solutions
which are lifts of arbitrary solutions of 4-dimensional U(1)^4 and
7-dimensional U(1)^2 gauged supergravities. We show that the structure of the
lift ansatze is sufficient to explicitly find a solution for the embedding and
motion of the M5- or M2-brane in the internal space. The brane probe action
then reduces to that of a massive charged particle in the gauged supergravity,
demonstrating that probing the gauged supergravity with such particles is
equivalent to the more involved 11-dimensional brane probe calculation. As an
application of this we use these particles to probe superstar geometries which
are conjectured to be sourced by giant gravitons.
