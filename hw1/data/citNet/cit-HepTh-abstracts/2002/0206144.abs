  We introduce a new first order formulation of world-volume actions for
p-branes with k-supersymmetry. In this language, which involves more auxiliary
fields compensated by more local symmetries, the action is provided by a very
compact, simple and elegant formula applicable to any supergravity background.
The k-supersymmetry variation against which it is invariant is obtained from
the bulk supersymmetries by means of a projector that has a simple expression
in terms of the auxiliary fields. The distinctive feature of our formalism is
that all fermion fields are hidden into the definition of the curvatures and
the action is formally the same, in terms of these differential forms as it
would be in a purely bosonic theory. Typically our new formulation enables one
to discuss the correct boundary actions for non trivial supergravity Dp-brane
bulk solutions like the D3-brane solution on smooth ALE manifolds with flux
recently constructed in the literature
