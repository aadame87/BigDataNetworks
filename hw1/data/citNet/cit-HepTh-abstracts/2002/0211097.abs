  We reconsider supersymmetric five dimensional rotating charged black holes,
and their description in terms of D-branes. By wrapping some of the branes on
K3, we are able to explore the role of the enhancon mechanism in this system.
We verify that enhancon loci protect the black hole from violations of the
Second Law of Thermodynamics which would have been achieved by the addition of
certain D-brane charges. The same charges can potentially result in the
formation of closed time-like curves by adding them to holes initially free of
them, and so the enhancon mechanism forbids this as well. Although this latter
observation is encouraging, it is noted that this mechanism alone does not
eliminate closed time-like curves from these systems, but is in accord with
earlier suggestions that they may not be manufactured, in this context, by
physical processes.
