  Covariant quantization of self-dual strings in 2+2 flat dimensions reduces
them to their zero modes, a consequence of extended world-sheet supersymmetry.
We demonstrate how to arrive at the same result more directly by employing a
`double' light-cone gauge. An unconventional feature of this gauge is the
removal of anticommuting degrees of freedom by commuting symmetries and vice
versa. The reducibility of the N=4 string and its equivalence with the N=2
string become apparent.
