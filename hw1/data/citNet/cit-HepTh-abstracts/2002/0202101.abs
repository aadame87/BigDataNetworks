  We construct a family of quasi-solvable quantum many-body systems by an
algebraic method. The models contain up to two-body interactions and have
permutation symmetry. We classify these models under the consideration of
invariance property. It turns out that this family includes the rational,
hyperbolic (trigonometric) and elliptic Inozemtsev models as the particular
cases.
