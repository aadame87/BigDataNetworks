  We analyse some physical consequences when supersymmetry is broken by a set
of D-branes and/or orientifold planes in Type II string theories. Generically,
there are global dilaton tadpoles at the disk level when the transverse space
is compact. By taking the toy model of a set of electric charges in a compact
space, we discuss two different effects appearing when global tadpoles are not
cancelled. On the compact directions a constant term appears that allows to
solve the equations of motion. On the non-compact directions Poincar\'e
invariance is broken. We analyse some examples where the Poincar\'e invariance
is broken along the time direction (cosmological models).After that, we discuss
how to obtain a finite interaction between D-branes and orientifold planes in
the compact space at the supergravity level.
