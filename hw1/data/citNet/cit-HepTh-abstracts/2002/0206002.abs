  The single 3-brane brane world at six dimension is examined when the extra
dimensions are not compact. Although the warp factor diverges at the asymptotic
region of the extra dimension, the normalizable zero mode and higher KK
spectrum exist in the gravitational fluctuation. We compute the zero mode
analytically and KK spectrum numerically. It is explicitly proven that our
solution does not obey `brane world sum rule'.
