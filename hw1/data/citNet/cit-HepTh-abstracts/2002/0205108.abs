  We give examples of string compactifications to 4d Minkowski space with
different amounts of supersymmetry that can be connected by spherical domain
walls. The tension of these domain walls is tunably lower than the 4d Planck
scale. The ``stringy'' description of these walls is known in terms of certain
configurations of wrapped Dirichlet and NS branes. This construction allows us
to connect a variety of vacua with 4d N=4,3,2,1 supersymmetry.
