  We study branes residing in infinite volume space and of finite extent in the
transverse directions. We calculate the graviton propagator in the harmonic
gauge both inside and outiside the brane and discuss its dependence on the
thickness of the brane. Our treatment includes the full tensor structure of the
propagator. In five dimensions, we show that the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov
(vDVZ) discontinuity can be avoided by an appropriate choice of gauge. This new
gauge is written explicitly in terms of the metric field without evoking the
field equations. It has a singular limit as the transverse size of the brane
shrinks to zero, so no such simple representation is possible in that limit.
