  We study the Penrose limit of ODp theory. There are two different PP-wave
limits of the theory. One of them is a ten dimensional PP-wave and the other a
four dimensional one. We observe the later one leads to an exactly solvable
background for type II string theories where we have both NS and RR fields. The
Penrose limit of different branes of string (M-theory) in a nonzero B/E field
(C field) is also studied. These backgrounds are conjectured to provide dual
description of NCSYM, NCOS and OM theory. We see that under S-duality the
subsector of NCSYM$_4$ and NCOS$_4$ which are dual to the corresponding string
theory on PP-wave coming from NCYM$_4$ and NCOS$_4$ map to each other for given
null geodesic.
