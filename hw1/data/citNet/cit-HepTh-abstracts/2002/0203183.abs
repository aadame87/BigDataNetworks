Title: A universal symmetry structure in open string theory

  In this paper, we arrive from different starting points at the conclusion
that the symmetry given by an action of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group GT
on the so called extended moduli space of string theory can not be physical -
in the sense that it does not survive the inclusion of general nonperturbative
vacua given by boundary conditions on the level of two dimensional conformal
field theory - but has to be extended to a quantum symmetry given by a
self-dual, noncommutative, and noncocommutative Hopf algebra. First, we show
that a class of two dimensional boundary conformal field theories always
uniquely defines a trialgebra and find the above mentioned Hopf algebra as the
universal symmetry of such trialgebras (in analogy to the definition of GT as
the universal symmetry of quasi-triangular quasi-Hopf algebras). Second, we
argue in a more heuristic approach that this Hopf algebra symmetry can also be
found in a more geometric picture using the language of gerbes. Finally, we
will see that the fact that the GT-symmetry can not be physical in the above
sense can also be seen by trying to understand why the action of GT on the
Duflo-Kirillov isomorphism trivializes.
