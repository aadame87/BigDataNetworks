  The vacuum of a large-N gauge field on a p-torus has a spatial stress tensor
with tension along the direction of smallest periodicity and equal pressures
(but p times smaller in magnitude) along the other directions, assuming an
AdS/CFT correspondence and a refined form of the Horowitz-Myers positive-energy
conjecture. For infinite N, the vacuum exhibits a phase transition when the
lengths of the two shortest periodicities cross. A comparison is made with the
Surya-Schleich-Witt phase transition at finite temperature. A zero-loop
approximation is also given for large but finite N.
