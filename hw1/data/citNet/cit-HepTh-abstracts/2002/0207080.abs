  We construct with a geometric procedure the supersymmetry transformation laws
and Lagrangian for all the ``variant'' D=11 and D=10 Type IIA supergravities.
We identify into our classification the D=11 and D=10 Type IIA ``variant''
theories first introduced by Hull performing T-duality transformation on both
spacelike and timelike circles. We find in addition a set of D=10 Type IIA
``variant'' supergravities that can not be obtained trivially from eleven
dimensions compactifying on a circle.
