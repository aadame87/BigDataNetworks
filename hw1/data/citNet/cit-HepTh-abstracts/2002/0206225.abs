Title: Calculation of the Observationally Small Cosmological Constant in the
  Model of Six-Dimensional Warped Brane-Bolt World
Author: Boris L. Altshuler
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX-2e
\\
  In the 6-dimensional model of warped compactification based on the euclidean
AdS Reissner-Nordstrom metric it is possible to escape artificial 4-brane's
stress-energy tensor anistropy necessary for fulfillment of Israel junction
conditions by introducing in 3+1 spacetime of the cosmological constant which
turns out to be ${}\sim G^2$ ($G$ - Newton's constant) and acquires the value
compatible with observations.
