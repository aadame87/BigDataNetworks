  In an attempt to study asymptotically plane wave spacetimes which admit an
event horizon, we find solutions to vacuum Einstein's equations in arbitrary
dimension which have a globally null Killing field and rotational symmetry. We
show that while such solutions can be deformed to include ones which are
asymptotically plane wave, they do not posses a regular event horizon. If we
allow for additional matter, such as in supergravity theories, we show that it
is possible to have extremal solutions with globally null Killing field, a
regular horizon, and which, in addition, are asymptotically plane wave. In
particular, we deform the extremal M2-brane solution in 11-dimensional
supergravity so that it behaves asymptotically as a 10-dimensional vacuum plane
wave times a real line.
