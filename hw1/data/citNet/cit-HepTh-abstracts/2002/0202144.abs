We study the issue of gauge invariance in five-dimensional theories
compactified on an orbifold $S^1/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}^\prime_2)$ in
the presence of an external U(1) gauge field. From the four-dimensional point
of view the theory contains a tower of Kaluza-Klein Dirac fermions with chiral
couplings and it looks anomalous at the quantum level. We show that this
``anomaly'' is cancelled by a topological Chern-Simons term which is generated
in the effective action when the gauge theory is regularized introducing an
Pauli-Villars fermion with an odd mass term. In the presence of a classical
background gauge field, the fermionic current acquires a vacuum expectation
value, thus generating the suitable Chern-Simons term and a gauge invariant
theory.
