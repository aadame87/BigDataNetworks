  In the perturbative AdS-CFT correspondence, the dual field whose source are
the prescribed boundary values of a bulk field in the functional integral, and
the boundary limit of the quantized bulk field are the same thing. This
statement is due to the fact that Witten graphs are boundary limits of the
corresponding Feynman graphs for the bulk fields, and hence the dual conformal
correlation functions are limits of bulk correlation functions. This
manifestation of duality is analyzed in terms of the underlying functional
integrals of different structure.
