  We consider the toroidal black holes that arise as a generalization of the
AdS_5 times S^5 solution of type IIB supergravity. The symmetries of the
horizon space allow T-duality transformations that can be exploited to generate
new inequivalent black hole solutions of both type IIB and type IIA
supergravity, with non-trivial dilaton, B-field, and RR forms. We examine the
asymptotic structure and thermodynamical properties of these solutions.
