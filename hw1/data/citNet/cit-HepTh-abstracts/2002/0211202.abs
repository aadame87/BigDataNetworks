Title: Seiberg Duality in Matrix Model
Authors: Bo Feng
Comments: 5 pages. Short notes. Abstract rewritten. Typo fixed
\\
  In this paper, we use the matrix model of pure fundamental flavors (without
the adjoint field) to check the Seiberg duality in the case of complete mass
deformation. We show that, by explicit integration at both sides of electric
and magnetic matrix models, the results agree with the prediction in the field
theory.
