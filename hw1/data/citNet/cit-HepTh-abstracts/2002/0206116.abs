  In the lightcone frame, where the supermembrane theory and the Matrix model
are strikingly similar, the equations of motion admit an elegant
complexification in even dimensional spaces. Although the explicit rotational
symmetry of the target space is lost, the remaining unitary symmetries apart
from providing a simple and unifying description of all known solutions suggest
new ones for rotating spherical and toroidal membranes. In this framework the
angular momentum is represented by U(1) charges which balance the nonlinear
attractive forces of the membrane. We examine in detail a six dimensional
rotating toroidal membrane solution which lives in a 3-torus, $T^3$ and admits
stable radial modes. In Matrix Theory it corresponds to a toroidal N-$D_{0}$
brane bound state. We demonstrate its existence and discuss its radial
stability.
