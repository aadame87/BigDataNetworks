  We continue the analysis of Vacuum String Field Theory in the presence of a
constant B field. In particular we give a proof of the ratio of brane tensions
is the expected one. On the wake of the recent literature we introduce
wedge-like states and orthogonal projections. Finally we show a few examples of
the smoothing out effects of the B field on some of the singularities that
appear in VSFT.
