  We study extremal and non-extremal generalizations of the regular non-abelian
solution found by Chamseddine and Volkov in 5d N=4 gauged supergravity, which
has been shown by Maldacena and Nastase to describe a system of NS5-branes
wrapping an three-sphere dual to three-dimensional U(N) N=1 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills with Chern-Simons coupling k=N/2. All black hole solutions have a
temperature larger than the Hagedorn temperature Tc of the little string theory
and their entropy decreases as the temperature increases. This is a sign that
the system is thermodynamically unstable above Tc. We have also found an
analytical solution describing NS5-branes wrapped on a constant radius
three-sphere and involving a linear dilaton. Its non-extremal generalization
has a temperature equal to 2 Tc.
