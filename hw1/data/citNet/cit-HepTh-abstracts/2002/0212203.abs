  I consider supergravity solutions of D5 branes wrapped on supersymmetric
2-cycles and use them to discuss relevant features of four-dimensional N=1
super Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N). In particular, using a
gravitational dual of the gaugino condensate, it is shown that is possible to
obtain the complete NSVZ $\beta$-function. It is also described how different
aspects of the gauge theory are nicely encoded in this supergravity solution.
