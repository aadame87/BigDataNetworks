  We perform a one-loop test of the holographic interpretation of the
Karch-Randall model, whereby a massive graviton appears on an AdS_4 brane in an
AdS_5 bulk. Within the AdS/CFT framework, we examine the quantum corrections to
the graviton propagator on the brane, and demonstrate that they induce a
graviton mass in exact agreement with the Karch-Randall result. Interestingly
enough, at one loop order, the spin 0, spin 1/2 and spin 1 loops contribute to
the dynamically generated (mass)^2 in the same 1: 3: 12 ratio as enters the
Weyl anomaly and the 1/r^3 corrections to the Newtonian gravitational
potential.
