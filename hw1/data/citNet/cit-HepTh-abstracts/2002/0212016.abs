  We study the possibility of extending ghost systems with higher spin to a
logarithmic conformal field theory. In particular we are interested in c=-26
which turns out to behave very differently to the already known c=-2 case. The
energy momentum tensor cannot be built anymore by a combination of derivatives
of generalized symplectic fermion fields.
  Moreover, the logarithmically extended theory is only consistent when
considered on nontrivial Riemann surfaces. This results in a LCFT with some
unexpected properties. For instance the Virasoro mode L_0 is diagonal and for
certain values of the deformation parameters even the whole global conformal
group is non-logarithmic.
