  We construct the Penrose limit backgrounds in closed forms along the generic
null geodesics for the near-horizon geometries of D1, D3, D5, NS1 and NS5
branes. The Penrose limit metrics of D1, D5 and NS1 have non-trivial dependence
of the light-cone time coordinate, while those of D3 and NS5 have no its
dependence. We study the Penrose limits on the marginal 1/4 supersymmetric
configurations of standard intersecting branes, such as the NS-NS intersection
of NS1 and NS5, the R-R intersections of Dp and Dq over some spatial dimensions
and the mix intersections of NS5 and Dp over (p -1)-dimensional spaces. They
are classified into three types that correspond to the Penrose limits of D1, D3
and D5 backgrounds.
