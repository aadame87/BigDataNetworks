  The little groups (i.e. the subgroups of Lorentz group, leaving invariant
given configurations of tensorial charges) of unitary irreps of
superstring/M-theory superalgebras are considered. It is noted, that in the
case of $(n-1)/n$ (maximal supersymmetric) BPS configuration in any dimensions
the non-zero supercharge is neutral w.r.t. the algebra of little group, which
means that all members of supermultiplet are in the same representation of that
algebra and hence of (generalized with tensorial charges) Poincare algebra.
This situation is similar to two-dimensional case and shows that usual
spin-statistics connection statement is insufficient in the presence of branes,
because different little groups can appear. We discuss the rules for definition
of statistics for representations of generalized Poincare, and note that a
geometric quantization method seems to be most relevant for that purpose.
