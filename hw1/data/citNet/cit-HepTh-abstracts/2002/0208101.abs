  Composite S-brane solutions in multidimensional gravity with scalar fields
and fields of forms related to Toda-like systems are presented. These solutions
are defined on a product manifold R_{*} x M_1 x ... x M_n, where R_{*} is a
time manifold, M_1 is an Einstein manifold and M_i (i > 1) are Ricci-flat
manifolds. Certain examples of S-brane solutions related to A_1 + ... + A_1,
A_m Toda chains and those with "block-orthogonal" intersections (e.g. SM-brane
solutions) are singled out. Under certain restrictions imposed a Kasner-like
asymptotical behaviour of the solutions is shown.
