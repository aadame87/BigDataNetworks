  We investigate the ABJ anomaly in the framework of an effective field theory
for a 3-brane scenario and show that the contribution from induced gravity on
the brane depends on both the topological structure of the bulk space-time and
the embedding of the brane in the bulk. This fact implies the existence of a
non-trivial vacuum structure of bulk quantum gravity. Furthermore, we argue
that this axial gravitational anomaly may not necessarily be cancelled by
choosing the matter content on the brane since it could be considered as a
possible effect from bulk quantum gravity.
