  We discuss the impact of a bulk photon mass in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati type
brane model with Maxwell terms both on the brane and in the bulk, as proposed
by Dvali, Gabadadze and Shifman. The motivation to include the bulk photon mass
is to suppress radiation loss into the bulk. We point out that this modifies
the photon propagator in such a way that it generates a small photon mass on
the brane. Compatibility with present bounds on a photon mass imply that the
transition to five-dimensional distance laws for the electromagnetic potentials
would appear only at super-horizon length scales, thus excluding any direct
detection possibility of a transition from four-dimensional to five-dimensional
distance laws in electromagnetic interactions. We also include results on
fermion propagators with Dirac terms on the brane and in the bulk.
