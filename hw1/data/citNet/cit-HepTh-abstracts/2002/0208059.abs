  We discuss gauge fields on tori in diverse dimensions, mainly in two and four
dimensions. We construct various explicit gauge fields which have some
topological charges and find the Dirac zero modes in the background of the
gauge fields. By using the zero mode, we give new gauge fields on the dual
torus, which is a gauge theoretical description of T-duality transformation of
the corresponding D-brane systems including DDbar systems. From the
transformation, we can easily see the duality expected from the index theorem.
It is also mentioned that, for each topological charges, the corresponding
constant curvature bundle can be constructed and their duality transformation
can be performed in terms of Heisenberg modules.
