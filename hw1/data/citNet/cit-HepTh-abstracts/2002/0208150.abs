Title: On the Large N Limit of Conformal Field Theory
Authors: M.B.Halpern
Comments: 50 pages, fixed typos and added references

  Following recent advances in large N matrix mechanics, I discuss here the
free (Cuntz) algebraic formulation of the large N limit of two-dimensional
conformal field theories of chiral adjoint fermions and bosons. One of the
central results is a new {\it affine free algebra} which describes a large N
limit of su(N) affine Lie algebra. Other results include the associated {\it
free-algebraic partition functions and characters}, a free-algebraic coset
construction, free- algebraic construction of osp(1|2), {\it free-algebraic
vertex operator constructions} in the large N Bose systems and a provocative
new free-algebraic factorization of the ordinary Koba-Nielsen factor.
