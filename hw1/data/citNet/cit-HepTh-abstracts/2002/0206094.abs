  We study the pp-wave limits of various elliptic models with orientifold
planes and D7-branes, as well as the pp-wave limit of an orientifold of adS_5 x
T^{11}. Many of the limits contain both open and closed strings. We also
present pp-wave limits of theories which give rise to a compact null direction
and contain open strings. Maps between the string theory states and gauge
theory operators are proposed.
