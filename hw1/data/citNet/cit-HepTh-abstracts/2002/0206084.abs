  In this work we compute the spectra, waveforms and total scalar energy
radiated during the radial infall of a small test particle coupled to a scalar
field into a $d$-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole. We focus
on $d=4, 5$ and 7, extending the analysis we have done for $d=3$. For small
black holes, the spectra peaks strongly at a frequency $\omega \sim d-1$, which
is the lowest pure anti-de Sitter (AdS) mode. The waveform vanishes
exponentially as $t \to \infty$, and this exponential decay is governed
entirely by the lowest quasinormal frequency. This collision process is
interesting from the point of view of the dynamics itself in relation to the
possibility of manufacturing black holes at LHC within the brane world
scenario, and from the point of view of the AdS/CFT conjecture, since the
scalar field can represent the string theory dilaton, and 4, 5, 7 are
dimensions of interest for the AdS/CFT correspondence.
