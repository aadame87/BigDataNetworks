Title: Solitons for the fuzzy sphere from matrix model
Authors: Paolo Valtancoli
Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX, no figures

  Recently we have introduced a matrix model depending on two coupling
constants $g^2$ and $\lambda$, which contains the fuzzy sphere as a background;
to obtain the classical limit $g^2$ must depend on $N$ in a precise way. In
this paper we show how to obtain the classical solitons of the $N \to \infty$
limit imposing the development $\lambda = \half + \frac{\lambda_0}{N}$; as a
consequence at finite $N$ one obtains a noncommutative version of the solitons
for the fuzzy sphere.
