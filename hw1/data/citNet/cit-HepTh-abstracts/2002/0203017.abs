  We elaborate the idea that the matrix models equipped with the gauge symmetry
provide a natural framework to describe identical particles. After
demonstrating the general prescription, we study an exactly solvable harmonic
oscillator type gauged matrix model. The model gives a generalization of the
Calogero-Sutherland system where the strength of the inverse square potential
is not fixed but dynamical bounded by below.
