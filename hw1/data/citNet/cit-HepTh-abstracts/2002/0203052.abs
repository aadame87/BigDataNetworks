  We study the dynamics of M-theory on G2 holonomy manifolds, and consider in
detail the manifolds realized as the quotient of the spin bundle over S^3 by
discrete groups. We analyse, in particular, the class of quotients where the
triality symmetry is broken. We study the structure of the moduli space,
construct its defining equations and show that three different types of
classical geometries are interpolated smoothly. We derive the N=1
superpotentials of M-theory on the quotients and comment on the membrane
instanton physics. Finally, we turn on Wilson lines that break gauge symmetry
and discuss some of the implications.
