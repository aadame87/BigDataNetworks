  We study the hermitean and normal two matrix models in planar approximation
for an arbitrary number of eigenvalue supports. Its planar graph interpretation
is given. The study reveals a general structure of the underlying analytic
complex curve, different from the hyperelliptic curve of the one matrix model.
The matrix model quantities are expressed through the periods of meromorphic
generating differential on this curve and the partition function of the
multiple support solution, as a function of filling numbers and coefficients of
the matrix potential, is shown to be the quasiclassical tau-function. The
relation to softly broken N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is discussed.
A general class of solvable multimatrix models with tree-like interactions is
considered.
