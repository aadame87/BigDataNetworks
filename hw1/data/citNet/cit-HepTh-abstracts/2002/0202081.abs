  The dynamics of the phase transition of the continuum $\Phi
^{4}_{1+1}$-theory in Light Cone Quantization is reexamined taking into account
fluctuations of the order parameter $< \Phi >$ in the form of dynamical zero
mode operators (DZMO) which appear in a natural way via the Haag expansion of
the field $\Phi (x)$ of the interacting theory. The inclusion of the DZM-sector
changes significantly the value of the critical coupling, bringing it in
agreement within 2% with the most recent Monte-Carlo and high
temperature/strong coupling estimates. The critical slowing down of the DZMO
governs the low momentum behavior of the dispersion relation through invariance
of this DZMO under conformal transformations preserving the local light cone
structure. The critical exponent $\eta$ characterising the scaling behaviour at
$k^2 \to 0$ comes out in agreement with the known value 0.25 of the Ising
universality class. $\eta$ is made of two contributions: one, analytic $(75 %$)
and another (25%) which can be evaluated only numerically with an estimated
error of 3%. The $\beta$-function is then found from the non-perturbative
expression of the physical mass. It is non-analytic in the coupling constant
with a critical exponent $\omega=2$. However, at D=2, $\omega$ is not
parametrisation independent with respect to the space of coupling constants due
to this strong non-analytic behaviour.
