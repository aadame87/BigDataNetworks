  We present a new scenario for baryogenesis in the context of heterotic
brane-world models. The baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated at a
small-instanton phase transition which is initiated by a moving brane colliding
with the observable boundary. We demonstrate, in the context of a simple model,
that reasonable values for the baryon asymmetry can be obtained. As a byproduct
we find a new class of moving-brane cosmological solutions in the presence of a
perfect fluid.
