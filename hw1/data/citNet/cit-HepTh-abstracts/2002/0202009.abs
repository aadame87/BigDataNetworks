  We derive the second variation Lagrangian of the Randall-Sundrum model with
two branes, study its gauge invariance and diagonalize it in the unitary gauge.
We also show that the effective four-dimensional theory looks different on
different branes and calculate the observable mass spectra and the couplings of
the physical degrees of freedom of 5-dimensional gravity to matter.
