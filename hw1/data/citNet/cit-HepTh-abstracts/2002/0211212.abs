  Physical arguments stemming from the theory of black-hole thermodynamics are
used to put constraints on the dynamics of closed-string tachyon condensation
in Scherk--Schwarz compactifications. A geometrical interpretation of the
tachyon condensation involves an effective capping of a noncontractible cycle,
thus removing the very topology that supports the tachyons. A semiclassical
regime is identified in which the matching between the tachyon condensation and
the black-hole instability flow is possible. We formulate a generalized
correspondence principle and illustrate it in several different circumstances:
an Euclidean interpretation of the transition from strings to black holes
across the Hagedorn temperature and instabilities in the brane-antibrane
system.
