  We discuss the holography and entropy bounds in Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory.
By applying a Geroch process to an arbitrary spherically symmetric black hole,
we show that the Bekenstein entropy bound always keeps its form as $S_{\rm
B}=2\pi E R$, independent of gravity theories. As a result, the
Bekenstein-Verlinde bound also remains unchanged. Along the Verlinde's
approach, we obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking bound and Hubble bound, which are
different from those in Einstein gravity. Furthermore, we note that when
$HR=1$, the three cosmological entropy bounds become identical as in the case
of Einstein gravity. But, the Friedmann equation in Gauss-Bonnet gravity can no
longer be cast to the form of cosmological Cardy formula.
