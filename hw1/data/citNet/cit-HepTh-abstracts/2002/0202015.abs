  We survey geometric quantization of finite dimensional affine Kahler
manifolds. Its corresponding prequantization and the Berezin's deformation
quantization formulation, as proposed by Cahen et al., is used to quantize
their corresponding Kahler quotients. Equivariant formalism greatly facilitates
the description.
