  Exact calculations are given for the Casimir energy for various fields in
$R\times S^3$ geometry. The Green's function method naturally gives a result in
a form convenient in the high-temperature limit, while the statistical
mechanical approach gives a form convenient for low temperatures. The
equivalence of these two representations is demonstrated. Some discrepancies
with previous work are noted. In no case, even for ${\cal N}=4$ SUSY, is the
ratio of entropy to energy found to be bounded. This deviation, however, occurs
for low temperature, where the equilibrium approach may not be relevant. The
same methods are used to calculate the energy and free energy for the TE modes
in a half-Einstein universe bounded by a perfectly conducting 2-sphere.
