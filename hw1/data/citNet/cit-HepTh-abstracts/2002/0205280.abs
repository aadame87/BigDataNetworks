  Following Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov [hep-th/0204051], we study strings in
AdS black hole backgrounds. With respect to the pure AdS case, rotating strings
are replaced by orbiting strings. We interpret these orbiting strings as CFT
states of large spin similar to glueballs propagating through a gluon plasma.
The energy and the spin of the orbiting string configurations are associated
with the energy and the spin of states in the dual finite temperature N=4 SYM
theory. We analyse in particular the limiting cases of short and long strings.
Moreover, we perform a thermodynamic study of the angular momentum transfer
from the glueball to the plasma by considering string orbits around rotating
AdS black holes. We find that standard expectations, such as the complete
thermal dissociation of the glueball, are borne out after subtle properties of
rotating AdS black holes are taken into account.
