  The Hamiltonian reduction of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory for arbitrary
\theta-angle to an unconstrained nonlocal theory of a self-interacting positive
definite symmetric 3 \times 3 matrix field S(x) is performed. It is shown that,
after exact projection to reduced phase space, the density of the Pontryagin
index remains a pure divergence, proving the \theta-independence of the
obtained unconstrained theory. Expansion of the nonlocal kinetic part of the
Hamiltonian in powers of inverse coupling constant and truncation to lowest
order, however, leads to violation of the \theta-independence of the theory. In
order to maintain this property on the level of the local approximate theory, a
modified expansion in inverse coupling constant is suggested, which for
vanishing \theta-angle coincides with the original expansion. The corresponding
approximate Lagrangian up to second order in derivatives is derived and the
explicit form of the unconstrained analog of the Chern-Simons current linear in
derivatives is given. Finally, for the case of degenerate field configurations
S(x) with rank|S|=1, a nonlinear \sigma-model type model is obtained, with the
Pontryagin topological term reducing to the Hopf invariant of the mapping from
the 3-sphere S^3 to the unit 2-sphere S^2 in the Whitehead form.
