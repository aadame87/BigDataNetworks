  Spacelike branes are new time-dependent systems to explore and it has been
observed that related supergravity solutions can be obtained by analytically
continuing known D-brane solutions. Here we show that analytic continuation of
known solutions of the Dirac-Born-Infeld equations also lead to interesting
analogs of time dependent gravity solutions. Properties of these new solutions,
which are similar to the Witten bubble of nothing and S-branes, are discussed.
We comment on how these new bubble solutions seem relevant to the tachyon
condensation process of non-BPS branes, and remark on their application to
cosmological scenarios. Unstable brane configurations which resemble S-brane
type solutions are also discussed.
