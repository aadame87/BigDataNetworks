  We discuss Strassler's hypothesis of matching nonperturbative effects in
orbifold pairs of gauge theories which are perturbatively planar equivalent.
One of the examples considered is the parent N=1 SU(N) supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory and its nonsupersymmetric orbifold daughter. We apply two
strategies allowing us to study nonperturbative effects: (i) low-energy
theorems; (ii) putting the theory on small-size T^4 or R^3 x S^1 the parent and
daughter theories are weakly coupled and amenable to quasiclassical treatment.
In all cases our consideration yields a mismatch between the parent and
daughter theories. Thus, regretfully, we present evidence against Strassler's
hypothesis.
