  We consider new cosmological solutions with a collapsing, an intermediate and
an expanding phase. The boundary between the expanding (collapsing) phase and
the intermediate phase is seen by comoving observers as a cosmological past
(future) horizon. The solutions are naturally embedded in string and M-theory.
In the particular case of a two-dimensional cosmology, space-time is flat with
an identification under boost and translation transformations. We consider the
corresponding string theory orbifold and calculate the modular invariant
one-loop partition function. In this case there is a strong parallel with the
BTZ black hole. The higher dimensional cosmologies have a time-like curvature
singularity in the intermediate region. In some cases the string coupling can
be made small throughout all of space-time but string corrections become
important at the singularity. This happens where string winding modes become
light which could resolve the singularity. The new proposed space-time casual
structure could have implications for cosmology, independently of string
theory.
