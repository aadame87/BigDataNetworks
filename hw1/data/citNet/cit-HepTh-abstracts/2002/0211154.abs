  We define the chiral zero modes' phase space of the G=SU(n)
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model as an (n-1)(n+2)-dimensional manifold M_q
equipped with a symplectic form involving a special 2-form - the Wess-Zumino
(WZ) term - which depends on the monodromy M. This classical system exhibits a
Poisson-Lie symmetry that evolves upon quantization into an U_q(sl_n) symmetry
for q a primitive even root of 1. For each constant solution of the classical
Yang-Baxter equation we write down explicitly a corresponding WZ term and
invert the symplectic form thus computing the Poisson bivector of the system.
The resulting Poisson brackets appear as the classical counterpart of the
exchange relations of the quantum matrix algebra studied previously. We argue
that it is advantageous to equate the determinant D of the zero modes' matrix
to a pseudoinvariant under permutations q-polynomial in the SU(n) weights,
rather than to adopt the familiar convention D=1.
