  In this paper we study the noncommutative extension of a modified U(n) sigma
model in 2+1 dimensions. Using the method of dressing transformations, an
iterative approach for the construction of solutions from a given seed
solution, we demonstrate the construction of multi-soliton and
soliton-antisoliton configurations for general n. As illustrative examples we
discuss U(3) solitons and consider the head-on collision of a U(2) soliton and
an antisoliton explicitly, which will result in a 90^{\text{o}} angle
scattering. Further we discuss the head-on collision of one U(2) soliton with
two antisolitons. This results in a 60^{\text{o}} angle scattering.
