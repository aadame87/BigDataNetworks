  We consider the dynamics of a contracting universe ruled by two minimally
coupled scalar fields with general exponential potentials. This model describes
string-inspired scenarios in the Einstein frame. Both background and
perturbations can be solved analytically in this model. Curvature perturbations
are generated with a scale invariant spectrum only for a dust-like collapse, as
happens for a single field model with an exponential potential. We find the
conditions for which a scale invariant spectrum for isocurvature perturbation
is generated.
