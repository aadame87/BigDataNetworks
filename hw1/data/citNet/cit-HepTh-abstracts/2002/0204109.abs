  We investigate a class of matrix model which describes the dynamics of
identical particles in even dimentional space. We show that the degrees of
freedom after some constraints are implimented is proportional to particle
number and consist of those for positions and internal degrees. The particle
dynamics is given by the metric on the smooth moduli space. The moduli space
metric for two particles is found. The size of tightly packed $N$ particles
grows like $\sqrt{N}$. Our matrix model is related to the matrix model for
fractional quantum Hall effect, the ADHM formalism of U(1) instantons on
noncommutative space, and supersymmetric D0 branes on D6 branes with nonzero
B-field in type IIA theory.
