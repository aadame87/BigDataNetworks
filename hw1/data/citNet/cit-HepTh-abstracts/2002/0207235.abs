  We study time-dependent solutions of Einstein-Maxwell gravity in four
dimensions coupled to tachyon matter--the Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangian that
provides an effective description of a decaying tachyon on an unstable D-brane
in string theory. Asymptotically, the solutions are similar to the recently
studied space-like brane solutions and carry S-brane charge. They do not break
the Lorentzian R-symmetry. We study the tachyon matter as a probe in such a
background and analyze its backreaction. For early/late times, the tachyon
field has a constant energy density and vanishing pressure as in flat space. On
the other hand, at intermediate times, the energy density of the tachyon
diverges and produces a space-like curvature singularity.
