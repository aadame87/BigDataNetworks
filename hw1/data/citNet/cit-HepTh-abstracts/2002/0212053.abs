  We consider the coupling of a single Dirac fermion to the three component
unit vector field which appears as an order parameter in the Faddeev model.
Classically, the coupling is determined by requiring that it preserves a
certain local frame independence. But quantum mechanically the separate left
and right chiral fermion number currents suffer from a frame anomaly. We employ
this anomaly to compute the fermion number of a knotted soliton. The result
coincides with the self-linking number of the soliton. In particular, the
anomaly structure of the fermions relates directly to the inherent chiral
properties of the soliton. Our result suggests that interactions between
fermions and knotted solitons can lead to phenomena akin the Callan-Rubakov
effect.
