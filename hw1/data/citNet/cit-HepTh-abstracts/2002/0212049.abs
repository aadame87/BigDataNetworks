Title: A hint of renormalization
Authors: B. Delamotte
Comments: 16 pages
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Statistical Mechanics
\\
  An elementary -- hopefully pedagogical -- introduction to perturbative
renormalization and renormalization group is presented. No prior knowledge of
field theory is necessary since the body of the article never refers to any
particular physical theory. This allows, in particular, to disentangle what is
specific to field theory and what is intrinsic to renormalization. A copious
conclusion aims at linking the general arguments and results seen in the text
to real phenomena encountered both in particle physics and statistical
mechanics.
