  We study the behaviour of the two- and three-point thermal Green functions,
to one loop order in noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory, at temperatures $T$
much higher than the external momenta $p$. We evaluate the amplitudes for small
and large values of the variable $\theta p T$ ($\theta$ is the noncommutative
parameter) and exactly compute the static gluon self-energy for all values of
$\theta p T$. We show that these gluon functions, which have a leading $T^2$
behaviour, are gauge independent and obey simple Ward identities. We argue that
these properties, together with the results for the lowest order amplitudes,
may be sufficient to fix uniquely the hard thermal loop effective action of the
noncommutative theory.
