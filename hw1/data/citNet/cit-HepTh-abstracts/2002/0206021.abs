  A gauged $SU_q(2)$ theory is characterized by two dual algebras, the first
lying close to the Lie algebra of SU(2) while the second introduces new degrees
of freedom that may be associated with non-locality or solitonic structure. The
first and second algebras, here called the external and internal algebras
respectively, define two sets of fields, also called external and internal. The
gauged external fields agree with the Weinberg-Salam model at the level of the
doublet representation but differ at the level of the adjoint representation.
For example the g-factor of the charged W-boson differs in the two models. The
gauged internal fields remain speculative but are analogous to color fields.
