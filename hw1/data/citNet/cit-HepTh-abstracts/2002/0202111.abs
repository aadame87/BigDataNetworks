  We investigate the Penrose limits of classical string and M-theory
backgrounds. We prove that the number of (super)symmetries of a supergravity
background never decreases in the limit. We classify all the possible Penrose
limits of AdS x S spacetimes and of supergravity brane solutions. We also
present the Penrose limits of various other solutions: intersecting branes,
supersymmetric black holes and strings in diverse dimensions, and cosmological
models. We explore the Penrose limit of an isometrically embedded spacetime and
find a generalisation to spaces with more than one time. Finally, we show that
the Penrose limit is a large tension limit for all branes including those with
fields of Born--Infeld type.
