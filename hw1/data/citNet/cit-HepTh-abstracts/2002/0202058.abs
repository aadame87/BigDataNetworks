  We use a previously derived integral representation for the four graviton
amplitude at two loops in Superstring theory, whose leading term for vanishing
momenta gives the two-loop contribution to the R^4 term in the Effective
Action. We find by an explicit computation that this contribution is zero, in
agreement with a general argument implying the vanishing of the R^4 term beyond
one loop.
