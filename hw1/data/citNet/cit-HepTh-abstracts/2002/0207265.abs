  We treat spherically symmetric black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity by
imposing boundary conditions on fluctuating metric on the horizon. Obtained
effective two-dimensional theory admits Virasoro algebra near the horizon. This
enables, with the help of Cardy formula, evaluation of the number of states.
Obtained results coincide with the known macroscopic expression for the entropy
of black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
