  Observational evidence suggests that our universe is currently evolving
towards an asymptotically de Sitter future. Unfortunately and in spite of much
recent attention, various quantum, holographic and cosmological aspects of de
Sitter space remain quite enigmatic. With such intrigue in mind, this paper
considers the ``construction'' of a toy model that describes an asymptotically
de Sitter universe. More specifically, we add fluid-like matter to an otherwise
purely de Sitter spacetime, formulate the relevant solutions and then discuss
the cosmological and holographic implications. If the objective is to construct
an asymptotically de Sitter universe that is free of singularities and has a
straightforward holographic interpretation, then the results of this analysis
are decidedly negative. Nonetheless, this toy model nicely illustrates the
pitfalls that might be encountered in a more realistic type of construction.
