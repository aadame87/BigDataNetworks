Title: The Elliptic Solutions to the Friedmann equation and the Verlinde's Maps

  We considered the solutions of the Friedmann equation in several setups,
arguing that the Weierstra$\ss$ form of the solutions leads to connections with
some Conformal Field Theory on a torus. Thus a link with the Cardy entropy
formula is obtained in a quite natural way. The argument is shown to be valid
in a four dimensional radiation dominated universe with a cosmological constant
as well as in four further different Universes.
