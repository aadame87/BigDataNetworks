\\
  A first-quantized string (and membrane) theory is developed here by using a
general wave function of the string (and membrane), analogously to the
first-quantized quantum theory of a point particle. From the general wave
function of the string (and membrane), the properties of the string (and
membrane) such as its relation to Bosons, Fermions and spacetime are
investigated. The string and membrane wave functions are found to be very
useful and we can deduce Klein-Gordon equation, Dirac equation and the
fundamental property of the spacetime from this new starting point.
