Title: The Supersymmetric Stueckelberg Mass and Overcoming the Fayet-Iliopoulos
  Mechanism for Breaking Symmetry

  Gauge invariant generation of mass for supersymmetric U(1) vector field
through use of a chiral Stueckelberg superfield is considered. When a
Fayet-Iliopoulos D term is also present, no breaking of supersymmetry ever
occurs so long as the Stueckelberg mass is not zero. A moduli space in which
gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken arises in this case.
