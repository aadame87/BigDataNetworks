  New gaugings of four dimensional N=8 supergravity are constructed, including
one which has a Minkowski space vacuum that preserves N=2 supersymmetry and in
which the gauge group is broken to $SU(3)xU(1)^2$. Previous gaugings used the
form of the ungauged action which is invariant under a rigid $SL(8,R)$ symmetry
and promoted a 28-dimensional subgroup ($SO(8),SO(p,8-p)$ or the
non-semi-simple contraction $CSO(p,q,8-p-q)$) to a local gauge group. Here, a
dual form of the ungauged action is used which is invariant under $SU^*(8)$
instead of $SL(8,R)$ and new theories are obtained by gauging 28-dimensional
subgroups of $SU^*(8)$. The gauge groups are non-semi-simple and are different
real forms of the $CSO(2p,8-2p)$ groups, denoted $CSO^*(2p,8-2p)$, and the new
theories have a rigid SU(2) symmetry. The five dimensional gauged N=8
supergravities are dimensionally reduced to D=4. The $D=5,SO(p,6-p)$ gauge
theories reduce, after a duality transformation, to the $D=4,CSO(p,6-p,2)$
gauging while the $SO^*(6)$ gauge theory reduces to the $D=4, CSO^*(6,2)$ gauge
theory. The new theories are related to the old ones via an analytic
continuation. The non-semi-simple gaugings can be dualised to forms with
different gauge groups.
