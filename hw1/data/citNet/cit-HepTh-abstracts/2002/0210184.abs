  We introduce a technique for restoring general coordinate invariance into
theories where it is explicitly broken. This is the analog for gravity of the
Callan-Coleman-Wess-Zumino formalism for gauge theories. We use this to
elucidate the properties of interacting massless and massive gravitons. For a
single graviton with a Planck scale Mpl and a mass mg, we find that there is a
sensible effective field theory which is valid up to a high-energy cutoff
Lambda parametrically above mg. Our methods allow for a transparent
understanding of the many peculiarities associated with massive gravitons,
among them the need for the Fierz-Pauli form of the Lagrangian, the presence or
absence of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in general backgrounds,
and the onset of non-linear effects and the breakdown of the effective theory
at large distances from heavy sources. The natural sizes of all non-linear
corrections beyond the Fierz-Pauli term are easily determined. The cutoff
scales as Lambda ~ (mg^4 Mpl)^(1/5) for the Fierz-Pauli theory, but can be
raised to Lambda ~ (mg^2 Mpl)^(1/3) in certain non-linear extensions. Having
established that these models make sense as effective theories, there are a
number of new avenues for exploration, including model building with gravity in
theory space and constructing gravitational dimensions.
