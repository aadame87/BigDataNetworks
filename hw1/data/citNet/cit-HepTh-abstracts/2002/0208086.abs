  We study bouncing and cyclic universes from an (n+1)-dimensional brane in the
(n+2)-dimensional charged AdS bulk background. In the moving domain wall (MDW)
approach this picture is clearly realized with a specified bulk configuration,
the 5D charged topological AdS (CTAdS_5) black hole with mass M and charge Q.
The bulk gravitational dynamics induces the 4D Friedmann equations with
CFT-radiation and exotic stiff matters for a dynamic brane. This provides
bouncing universes for k=0, -1 and cyclic universe for k=1, even though it has
an exotic stiff matter from the charge Q. In this work we use the other of the
Binetruy-Deffayet-Langlos (BDL) approach with the bulk Maxwell field. In this
case we are free to determine the corresponding mass M-tilde and charge Q-tilde
because the mass term is usually included as an initial condition and the
charge is given by an unspecified solution to the Maxwell equation under the
BDL metric. Here we obtain only bouncing universes if one does not choose two
CTAdS_5 black holes as the bulk spacetime. We provide a way of avoiding the
exotic matter on the brane by introducing an appropriate local matter. Finally
we discuss an important relation between the exotic holographic matter and
Lorentz invariance violation.
