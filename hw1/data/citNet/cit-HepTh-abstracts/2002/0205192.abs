  The entropy and information puzzles arising from black holes cannot be
resolved if quantum gravity effects remain confined to a microscopic scale. We
use concrete computations in nonperturbative string theory to argue for three
kinds of nonlocal effects that operate over macroscopic distances. These
effects arise when we make a bound state of a large number of branes, and occur
at the correct scale to resolve the paradoxes associated with black holes.
