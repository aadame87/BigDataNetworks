  Weak gravity in the brane world scenario with a scalar field in the bulk
between two end-of-the-world branes is investigated by using the doubly gauge
invariant formalism. We review the result that Einstein gravity is restored in
the low energy limit and that high-energy corrections to Einstein gravity can
be mimicked by higher derivative terms. After that, it is argued that
non-locality is one of essential features of brane worlds.
