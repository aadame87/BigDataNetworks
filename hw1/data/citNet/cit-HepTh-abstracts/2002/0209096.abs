  We calculate the effective potential for the WLPNGB in a world with a
circular latticized extra dimension. The mass of the WLPNGB is calculated from
the one-loop quantum effect of scalar fields at zero and finite temperature. We
show that a series expansion by the modified Bessel functions is useful to
calculate the one-loop effective potentials.
