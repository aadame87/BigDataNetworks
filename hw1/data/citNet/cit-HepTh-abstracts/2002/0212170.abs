Title: Scalar Field Theory on Fuzzy S^4
Authors: Julieta Medina and Denjoe O'Connor
Comments: 16 pages, LaTeX
\\
  Scalar fields are studied on fuzzy $S^4$ and a solution is found for the
elimination of the unwanted degrees of freedom that occur in the model. The
resulting theory can be interpreted as a Kaluza-Klein reduction of CP^3 to S^4
in the fuzzy context.
