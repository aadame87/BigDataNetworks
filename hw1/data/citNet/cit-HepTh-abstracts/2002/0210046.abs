Title: Tests of the AdS/CFT Correspondence in Time-Dependent Settings
Authors: A.M. Ghezelbash, R.B. Mann
Comments: 6 pages, references added
\\
  We compute the boundary stress-energies of time-dependent asymptotically AdS
spacetimes in 5 and 7 dimensions, and find that their traces are equal to the
respective 4 and 6 dimensional field-theoretic trace anomalies. This provides
good supporting evidence in favour of the AdS/CFT correspondence in
time-dependent backgrounds.
