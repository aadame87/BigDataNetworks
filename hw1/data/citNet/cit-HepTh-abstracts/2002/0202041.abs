  We show how a lattice approach can be used to derive Thermodynamic Bethe
Ansatz (TBA) equations describing all excitations for boundary flows. The
method is illustrated for a prototypical flow of the tricritical Ising model by
considering the continuum scaling limit of the A4 lattice model with integrable
boundaries. Fixing the bulk weights to their critical values, the integrable
boundary weights admit two boundary fields $\xi$ and $\eta$ which play the role
of the perturbing boundary fields $\phi_{1,3}$ and $\phi_{1,2}$ inducing the
renormalization group flow between boundary fixed points. The excitations are
completely classified in terms of (m,n) systems and quantum numbers but the
string content changes by certain mechanisms along the flow. For our
prototypical example, we identify these mechanisms and the induced map between
the relevant finitized Virasoro characters. We also solve the boundary TBA
equations numerically to determine the flows for the leading excitations.
