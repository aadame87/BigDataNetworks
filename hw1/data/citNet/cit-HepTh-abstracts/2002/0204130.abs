Title: Vafa-Witten theorem and Lee-Yang singularities

  We show the absence of Lee-Yang singularities in the partition function of
QCD close to the CP symmetric point theta=0 in the complex theta plane.
Analyticity of the theta vacuum energy density at theta=0 provides a key
missing link in the Vafa-Witten proof of absence of spontaneous breaking of
parity symmetry in vector-like gauge theories. The result follows from
renormalizability, unitarity, positivity and existence of BPS bounds.
Generalisations of this theorem to other physical systems are also discussed
with particular interest focused on the non-linear CP^N sigma model.
