Title: Confinement versus asymptotic freedom

  I put forward the low-energy confining asymptote of the solution $<W_{C}>$
(valid for large macroscopic contours C of the size $>>1/\Lambda_{QCD}$) to
the large N Loop equation in the D=4 U(N) Yang-Mills theory with the
asymptotic freedom in the ultraviolet domain. Adapting the multiscale
decomposition characteristic of the Wilsonean renormgroup, the proposed Ansatz
for the loop-average is composed in order to sew, along the lines of the
bootstrap approach, the large N weak-coupling series for high-momentum modes
with the $N\to{\infty}$ limit of the recently suggested stringy representation
of the 1/N strong-coupling expansion Dub4 applied to low-momentum
excitations. The resulting low-energy stringy theory can be described through
such superrenormalizable deformation of the noncritical Liouville string that,
being devoid of ultraviolet divergences, does not possess propagating degrees
of freedom at short-distance scales $<<1/{\sqrt{\sigma_{ph}}}$, where
$\sigma_{ph}\sim{(\Lambda_{QCD})^{2}}$ is the physical string tension.
