  It is proved that the projections of the deformation vector field, normal and
tangential to the worldsheet manifold swept out by Dirac-Nambu-Goto bosonic
extendons propagating in a curved background, play the role of {\it global}
symplectic potentials on the corresponding Witten covariant phase space. It is
also proved that the {\it presymplectic} structure obtained from such
potentials by direct exterior derivation, has not components tangent to the
action of the relevant diffeomorphisms group of the theory.
