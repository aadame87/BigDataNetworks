  In this talk, we show how the monodromy matrix, ${\hat{\cal M}}$, can be
constructed for the two dimensional tree level string effective action. The
pole structure of ${\hat{\cal M}}$ is derived using its factorizability
property. It is shown that the monodromy matrix transforms non-trivially under
the non-compact T-duality group, which leaves the effective action invariant
and this can be used to construct the monodromy matrix for more complicated
backgrounds starting from simpler ones. We construct, explicitly, ${\hat{\cal
M}}$ for the exactly solvable Nappi-Witten model, both when B=0 and $B\neq 0$,
where these ideas can be directly checked.
