  We analyze the decomposition of tensor products of infinite dimensional
discrete series (unitary) and finite-dimensional (non-unitary) representations
of SL(2,R). Although such tensor products are not in general completely
reducible, we show that the product representations become completely reducible
on the cohomology of a natural nilpotent operator Q derived from the Casimir.
We introduce a definition of the character of a representation compatible with
the cohomology and use these characters to derive explicit tensor product
decomposition formulae.
