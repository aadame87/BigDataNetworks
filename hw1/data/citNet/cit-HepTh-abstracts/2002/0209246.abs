  We consider the one-dimensional XXX spin 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet at
zero temperature and zero magnetic field. We are interested in a probability of
formation of a ferromagnetic string in the antiferromagnetic ground-state. We
call it emptiness formation probability [EFP]. We suggest a new technique for
computation of EFP in the inhomogeneous case. It is based on quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We evalauted EFP for strings of the length six
in the inhomogeneous case. The homogeneous limit confirms our hypothesis about
the relation of quantum correlations to number theory. We also make a
conjecture about a general structure of EFP for arbitrary lenght of the string
