  There is good support for the embedding of the Standard Model fermions in the
chiral 16 representation of SO(10). Such an embedding is provided by the
realistic free fermionic heterotic-string models. In this talk we demonstrate
the existence of solutions with 3 generations and SO(10) observable gauge
group, in the case of compactification on a torus-fibred Calabi-Yau space over
a Hirzebruch base surface. The SO(10)symmetry is broken to SU(5)xU(1) by a
Wilson line. The overlap with the realistic free fermionic heterotic-string
models is discussed.
