Title: On Non-Commutative Orbifolds of K3 Surfaces

  Using the algebraic geometry method of Berenstein and Leigh for the
construction of the toroidal orbifold (T^2 x T^2 x T^2) / (Z_2 x Z_2) with
discrete torsion and considering local K3 surfaces, we present non-commutative
aspects of the orbifolds of product of K3 surfaces. In this way, the ordinary
complex deformation of K3 can be identified with the resolution of stringy
singularities by non-commutative algebras using crossed products. We give
representations and make some comments regarding the fractionation of branes.
Illustrating examples are presented.
