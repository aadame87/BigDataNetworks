  We compute the instanton expansions of the holomorphic couplings in the
effective action of certain $\cx N=1$ supersymmetric four-dimensional open
string vacua. These include the superpotential $W(\phi)$, the gauge kinetic
function $f(\phi)$ and a series of other holomorphic couplings which are known
to be related to amplitudes of topological open strings at higher world-sheet
topologies. The results are in full agreement with the interpretation of the
holomorphic couplings as counting functions of BPS domain walls. Similar
techniques are used to compute genus one partition function for the closed
topological string on Calabi--Yau 4-fold which gives rise to a theory with the
same number of supercharges in two dimensions.
