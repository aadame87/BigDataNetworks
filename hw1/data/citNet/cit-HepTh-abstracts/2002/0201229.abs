Title: A Proposal for the Vector State in Vacuum String Field Theory

  A previous calculation on the tachyon state arising as fluctuations of a $D$
brane in vacuum string field theory is extended to include the vector state. We
use the boundary conformal field theory approach of Rastelli, Sen and Zwiebach
to construct a vector state. It is shown that the vector field satisfies the
linearized equations of motion provided the two conditions $k^2=0$ and $k^\mu
A_\mu=0$ are satisfied. Earlier calculations using Fock space techniques by
Hata and Kawano have found massless vector states that are not necessarily
transverse.
