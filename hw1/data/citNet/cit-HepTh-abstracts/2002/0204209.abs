  We consider giant gravitons as probes of a class of ten-dimensional solutions
of type IIB supergravity which arise as lifts of solutions of U(1)^3 gauged N=2
supergravity in five-dimensions. Surprisingly it is possible to solve exactly
for minimum energy configurations of these spherical D3-brane probes in the
compact directions, even in backgrounds which preserve no supersymmetry. The
branes behave as massive charged particles in the five non-compact dimensions.
As an example we probe geometries which are believed to represent the
supergravity background of coherent states of giant gravitons. We comment on
the apparently repulsive nature of the naked singularities in these geometries.
