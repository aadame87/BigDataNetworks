  On a slice of AdS_5, despite having a dimensionful coupling, gauge theories
can exhibit logarithmic dependence on scale. In this paper, we utilize
deconstruction to analyze the scaling behavior of the theory, both above and
below the AdS curvature scale, and shed light on position-dependent
regularizations of the theory. We comment on applications to geometries other
than AdS.
