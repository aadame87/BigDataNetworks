  We formulate the planar `large N limit' of matrix models with a continuously
infinite number of matrices directly in terms of U(N) invariant variables.
Non-commutative probability theory, is found to be a good language to describe
this formulation. The change of variables from matrix elements to invariants
induces an extra term in the hamiltonian,which is crucual in determining the
ground state. We find that this collective potential has a natural meaning in
terms of non-commutative probability theory:it is the `free Fisher information'
discovered by Voiculescu. This formulation allows us to find a variational
principle for the classical theory described by such large N limits. We then
use the variational principle to study models more complex than the one
describing the quantum mechanics of a single hermitian matrix (i.e., go beyond
the so called D=1 barrier). We carry out approximate variational calculations
for a few models and find excellent agreement with known results where such
comparisons are possible. We also discover a lower bound for the ground state
by using the non-commutative analogue of the Cramer-Rao inequality.
