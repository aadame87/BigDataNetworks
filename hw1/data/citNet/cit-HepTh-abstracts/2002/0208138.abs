Title: Maximal-acceleration phase space relativity from Clifford algebras
Author: Carlos Castro
Comments: 15 pages, revised Latex file
\\
  We present a new physical model that links the maximum speed of light with
the minimal Planck scale into a maximal-acceleration Relativity principle in
the spacetime tangent bundle and in phase spaces (cotangent bundle). Crucial in
order to establish this link is the use of Clifford algebras in phase spaces.
The maximal proper-acceleration bound is a = c^2/ \Lambda in full agreement
with the old predictions of Caianiello, the Finslerian geometry point of view
of Brandt and more recent results in the literature. We present the reasons why
an Extended Scale Relativity based on Clifford spaces is physically more
appealing than those based on kappa-deformed Poincare algebras and the
inhomogeneous quantum groups operating in quantum Minkowski spacetimes. The
main reason being that the Planck scale should not be taken as a deformation
parameter to construct quantum algebras but should exist already as the minimum
scale in Clifford spaces.
