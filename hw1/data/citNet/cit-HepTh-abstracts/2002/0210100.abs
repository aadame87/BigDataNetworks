  Subject of this work is a class of Chern-Simons field theories with
non-semisimple gauge group, which may well be considered as the most
straightforward generalization of an Abelian Chern-Simons field theory. As a
matter of fact these theories, which are characterized by a non-semisimple
group of gauge symmetry, have cubic interactions like those of non-abelian
Chern-Simons field theories, but are free from radiative corrections. Moreover,
at the tree level in the perturbative expansion,there are only two connected
tree diagrams, corresponding to the propagator and to the three vertex
originating from the cubic interaction terms. For such theories it is derived
here a set of BRST invariant observables, which lead to metric independent
amplitudes. The vacuum expectation values of these observables can be computed
exactly. From their expressions it is possible to isolate the Gauss linking
number and an invariant of the Milnor type, which describes the topological
relations among three or more closed curves.
