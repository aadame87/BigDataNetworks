  The possibility of noncommutative topological gravity arising in the same
manner as Yang-Mills theory is explored. We use the Seiberg-Witten map to
construct such a theory based on a SL(2,C) complex connection, from which the
Euler characteristic and the signature invariant are obtained. This gives us a
way towards the description of noncommutative gravitational instantons as well
as noncommutative local gravitational anomalies.
