Title: IIB Soliton Spectra with All Fluxes Activated

  Building upon an earlier proposal for the classification of fluxes, a
sequence is proposed which generalizes the AHSS by computing type IIB string
theory's group of conserved RR and also NS charges, which is conjectured to be
a K-theory of dual pairs. As a test, the formalism of Maldacena, Moore and
Seiberg (hep-th/0108100) is applied to classify D-branes, NS5-branes, F-strings
and their dielectric counterparts in IIB compactified on a 3-sphere with both
NS and RR background fluxes. The soliton spectra on the 3-sphere are then
compared with the output of the sequence, as is the baryon spectrum in Witten's
non-spin^c example, AdS^5xRP^5. The group of conserved charges is seen to
change during Brown-Teitelboim-like phase transitions which change the
effective cosmological constant.
