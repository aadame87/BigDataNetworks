  We study how the DGP (Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati) brane affects particle
dynamics in linearized approximation. We find that once the particle is removed
from the brane it is repelled to the bulk. Assuming that the cutoff for
gravitational interaction is $M_*\sim 1/\epsilon$, we calculate the classical
self energy of a particle as the function of its position. Since the particle
wants to go to the region where its self energy is lower, it is repelled from
the brane to the bulk where it gains its 5D self energy. Cases when mass of the
particle $m<8\pi^2M_*$ and $m>8\pi^2M_*$ are qualitatively different, and in
later case one has to take into account effects of strong gravity. In both
cases the particle is repelled from the brane. For $m<8\pi^2M_*$ we obtain the
same result from the 'electrostatic' analog of the theory. In that language
mass (charge) in the bulk induces charge distribution on the brane which
shields the other side of the brane and provides repulsive force. The DGP brane
acts as a conducting plane in electrostatics (keeping in mind that in gravity
different charges repel). The repulsive nature of the brane requires a certain
localization mechanism. When the particle overcomes the localizing potential it
rapidly moves to the bulk. Particles of mass $m>8\pi^2M_*$ form a black hole
within $1/M_*$ distance from the brane.
