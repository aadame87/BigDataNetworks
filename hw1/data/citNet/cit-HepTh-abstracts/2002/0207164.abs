  The origin of the anomalies is analyzed. It is shown that they are due to the
fact that the generators of the symmetry do not leave invariant the domain of
definition of the Hamiltonian and then a term, normally forgotten in the
Heisenberg equation, gives an extra contribution responsible for the non
conservation of the charges. This explanation is equivalent to that of the
Fujikawa in the path integral formalism. Finally, this approach is applied to
the conformal symmetry breaking in two-dimensional quantum mechanics.
