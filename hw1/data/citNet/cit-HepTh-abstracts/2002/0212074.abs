Title: Plane Waves and Vacuum Interpolation
Authors: Guillermo A. Silva
Comments: 13 pages, 3 figures
\\
  A 1/2-BPS family of time dependent plane wave spacetimes which give rise to
exactly solvable string backgrounds is presented. In particular a solution
which interpolates between Minkowski spacetime and the maximally supersymmetric
homogeneous plane wave along a timelike direction is analyzed. We work in d=4,
N=2 supergravity, but the results can be easily extended to d=10,11. The
conformal boundary of a particular class of solutions is studied.
