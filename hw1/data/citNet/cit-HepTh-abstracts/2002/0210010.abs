  The abelian Higgs model on the noncommutative plane admits both BPS vortices
and non-BPS fluxons. After reviewing the properties of these solitons, we
discuss several new aspects of the former. We solve the Bogomoln'yi equations
perturbatively, to all orders in the inverse noncommutivity parameter, and show
that the metric on the moduli space of k vortices reduces to the computation of
the trace of a k-dimensional matrix. In the limit of large noncommutivity, we
present an explicit expression for this metric.
