Title: Re-establishing supersymmetry between harmonic oscillators in $D \neq 1$
  dimensions
Authors: Miloslav Znojil
Comments: Written version of the review lecture presented during the winter
  school Geometry and Physics (Srni, Czech Republic, 12. - 19. January 2002),
  submitted to its proceedings. Latex, 13 pp, 2 figures

  Using a PT symmetric regularization technique we reminad the reader that and
how (a) the SUSY is re-established between the two shifted harmonic oscillator
potentials $ V(q)=q^2+{G}/{q^2}+ const$ and (b) many non-equivalent Hermitian
and non-Hermitian (PT symmetric) systems may often be studied in parallel (with
a schematic solvable illustrative example added).
