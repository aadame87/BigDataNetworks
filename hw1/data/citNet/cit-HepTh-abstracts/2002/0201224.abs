  We study a deformation of the type IIB Maldacena-Nunez background which
arises as the near-horizon limit of NS5 branes wrapped on a two-cycle. This
background is dual to a "little string theory" compactified on a two-sphere, a
theory which at low energies includes four-dimensional N = 1 super Yang-Mills
theory. The deformation we study corresponds to a mass term for some of the
scalar fields in this theory, and it breaks supersymmetry completely. In the
language of seven-dimensional SO(4) gauged supergravity the deformation
involves (at leading order) giving a VEV, depending only on the radial
coordinate, to a particular scalar field. We explicitly construct the
corresponding solution at leading order in the deformation, both in
seven-dimensional and in ten-dimensional supergravity, and we verify that it
completely breaks supersymmetry. Since the original background had a mass gap
and we are performing a small deformation, the deformed background is
guaranteed to be stable even though it is not supersymmetric.
