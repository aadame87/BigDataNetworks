  We propose a universal geometric construction of complex non-Kaehler
manifolds with intrinsic SU(3) structure, used in supersymmetric string
compactifications. All these manifolds are some T^2 fibrations over a
Calabi-Yau base. We show that the conditions of N=1 supersymmetry in the
heterotic string theory specify a subclass of manifolds that we constructed,
which generalizes the examples known in the literature. Moreover, many known
examples of internal manifolds in type II string compactifications can also be
described in our construction, although supersymmetry restrictions of the
geometry are not known yet. Mathematically, we construct complex, Hermitian
non-Kaehler (n+1)-folds with a holomorphically trivial canonical bundle
fibering over Calabi-Yau n-folds. We show that one can lift Special Lagrangian
submanifolds and fibrations from the base Calabi-Yau to Special Lagrangian
(calibrated) submanifolds and fibrations upstairs. We discuss in detail the
example with the compact K3 CY as the base manifold.
