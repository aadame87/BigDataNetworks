  We give an explicit construction of general classical solutions for the
noncommutative CP^(N-1) model in two dimensions, showing that they correspond
to integer values for the action and topological charge. We also give explicit
solutions for the Dirac equation in the background of these general solutions
and show that the index theorem is satisfied.
