  The notion of a "point" is essential to describe the topology of spacetime.
Despite this, a point probably does not play a particularly distinguished role
in any intrinsic formulation of string theory. We discuss one way to try to
determine the notion of a point from a worldsheet point of view. The derived
category description of D-branes is the key tool. The case of a flop is
analyzed and Pi-stability in this context is tied in to some ideas of
Bridgeland. Monodromy associated to the flop is also computed via Pi-stability
and shown to be consistent with previous conjectures.
