  We present a class of orthogonal membrane configurations which preserve 1/4
of the full type IIA supersymmetry. These membrane configurations carry
additional F-string charges. We further analyze the D1-D3 configuration after
applying T- duality along the world volume directions of the above orthogonal
membranes.
