  For m^2 < a^2 + q^2, with m, a, and q respectively the source mass, angular
momentum per unit mass, and electric charge, the Kerr--Newman (KN) solution of
Einstein's equation reduces to a naked singularity of circular shape, enclosing
a disk across which the metric components fail to be smooth. By considering the
Hawking and Ellis extended interpretation of the KN spacetime, it is shown
first that, similarly to the electron-positron system, this solution presents
four inequivalent classical states. Next, it is shown that due to the
topological structure of the extended KN spacetime it does admit states with
half-integral angular momentum. This last property is corroborated by the fact
that, under a rotation of the space coordinates, those inequivalent states
transform into themselves only after a 4pi rotation. As a consequence, it
becomes possible to naturally represent them in a Lorentz spinor basis. The
state vector representing the whole KN solution is then constructed, and its
evolution is shown to be governed by the Dirac equation. The KN solution can
thus be consistently interpreted as a model for the electron-positron system,
in which the concepts of mass, charge and spin become connected with the
spacetime geometry. Some phenomenological consequences of the model are
explored.
