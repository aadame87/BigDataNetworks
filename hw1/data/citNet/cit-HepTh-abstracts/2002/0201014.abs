  The kinematical part of general theory of deformational structures on smooth
manifolds is developed. We introduce general concept of d-objects deformation,
then within the set of all such deformations we develop some special algebra
and investigate group and homotopical properties of the set. In case of proper
deformations some propositions, generalizing isometry theory on Riemannian
manifolds are formulated.
