  We find transformation matrices allowing to express non-commutative three
dimensional harmonic oscillator in terms of an isotropic commutative
oscillator, following ``philosophy of simplicity'' approach. Non-commutative
parameters have physical interpretation in terms of an external magnetic field.
Furthermore, we show that for a particular choice of noncommutative parameters
there is an equivalent anisotropic representation, whose transformation
matrices are far more complicated. We indicate a way to obtain the more complex
solutions from the simple ones.
