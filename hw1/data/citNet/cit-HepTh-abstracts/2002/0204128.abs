  We deconstruct the non-supersymmetric SU(5) breaking by discrete symmetry on
the space-time $M^4\times S^1$ and $M^4\times S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2')$ in the
Higgs mechanism deconstruction scenario. And we explain the subtle point on how
to exactly match the continuum results with the latticized results on the
quotient space $S^1/Z_2$ and $S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2')$. We also propose an
effective deconstruction scenario and discuss the gauge symmetry breaking by
the discrete symmetry on theory space in this approach. As an application, we
suggest the $G^N$ unification where $G^N$ is broken down to $SU(3)\times
SU(2)\times U(1)^{n-3}$ by the bifundamental link fields and the
doublet-triplet splitting can be achieved.
