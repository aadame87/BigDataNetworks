  We develop an approach based on the Noether method to construct nilpotent
BRST charges and BRST-invariant actions. We apply this approach first to the
holomorphic part of the flat-space covariant superstring, and we find that the
ghosts b, c_z which we introduced by hand in our earlier work, are needed to
fix gauge symmetries of the ghost action. Then we apply this technique to the
superparticle and determine its cohomology. Finally, we extend our results to
the combined left- and right-moving sectors of the superstring.
