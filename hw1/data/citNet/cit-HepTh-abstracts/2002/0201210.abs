  The number of asymptotically de Sitter (non-singular) solutions of 5d
dilatonic gravity with positive cosmological constant is found. These solutions
are similar to the previously known asymptotically AdS spaces where dilaton may
generate the singularity. Using these solutions the consistent $c$-function is
proposed in the same way as in AdS/CFT. The consistency of RG flow gives
further support for dS/CFT correspondence. From holographic RG flow equations
we calculate the holographic 4d conformal anomaly with dilatonic contributions.
This conformal anomaly turns out to be the same as in AdS/CFT correspondence.
