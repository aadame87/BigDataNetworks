Title: Vanishing index for supersymmetric 2-matrix model with odd dimensional
  gauge group
Authors: G. M. Graf, D. Hasler, J. Hoppe
\\
  We define an operator which for odd-dimensional compact gauge group furnishes
unitary equivalence of the bosonic and fermionic sector in the supersymmetric
quantum-mechanical matrix model obtained by dimensional reduction from
3-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
