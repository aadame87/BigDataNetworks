  In three-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell gravity the electrostatic
Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli solution and the magnetostatic Hirschmann-Welch
solution are connected by a duality mapping. Here we point out that a similar
duality mapping exists among circularly symmetric electrostatic and
magnetostatic spacetimes, and electric and magnetic stationary solutions, for a
nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to three-dimensional Einstein gravity.
