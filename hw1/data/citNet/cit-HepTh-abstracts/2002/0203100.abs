  On a historical note, we first describe the early superspace construction of
counterterms in supergravity and then move on to a brief discussion of selected
areas in string theory where higher order supergravity invariants enter the
effective theories. Motivated by this description we argue that it is important
to understand $p$-brane actions with $\k$-invariant higher order terms, thus
re-opening the question of $\k$-invariant ``rigidity'' terms. Finally we
describe a recent construction of such an action using the superembedding
formalism.
