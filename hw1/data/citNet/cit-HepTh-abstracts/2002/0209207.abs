Title: Effective Lagrangians in Pseudo-Supersymmetry
Authors: Matthias Klein

  I discuss effective field theories of brane-world models where different
sectors break different halves of the extended bulk supersymmetry. It is shown
how to consistently couple N=2 supersymmetric matter to N=1 superfields that
lack N=2 partners but transform in a non-linear representation of the N=2
algebra. In particular, I explain how to couple an N=2 vector to N=1 chiral
fields such that the second supersymmetry is non-linearly realized. This method
is then used to study systems where different sectors break different halves of
supersymmetry, which appear naturally in models of intersecting branes.
