  The two surprising features of gravity are (a) the principle of equivalence
and (b) the connection between gravity and thermodynamics. Using principle of
equivalence and special relativity in the {\it local inertial frame}, one could
obtain the insight that gravity must possess a geometrical description. I show
that, using the same principle of equivalence, special relativity and quantum
theory in the {\it local Rindler frame} one can obtain the Einstein-Hilbert
action functional for gravity and thus the dynamics of the spacetime. This
approach, which essentially involves postulating that the horizon area must be
proportional to the entropy, uses the local Rindler frame as a natural
extension of the local inertial frame and leads to the interpretation that the
gravitational action represents the free energy of the spacetime geometry. As
an aside, one also obtains a natural explanation as to: (i) why the covariant
action for gravity contains second derivatives of the metric tensor and (ii)
why the gravitational coupling constant is positive. The analysis suggests that
gravity is intrinsically holographic and even intrinsically quantum mechanical.
