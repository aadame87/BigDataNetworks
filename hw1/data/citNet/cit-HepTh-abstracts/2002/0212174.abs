  The problem of decomposition of unitary irreps of (super) tensorial (i.e.
extended with tensorial charges) Poincar{\'e} algebra w.r.t. its different
subalgebras is considered. This requires calculation of little groups for
different configurations of tensor charges. Particularly, for preon states
(i.e. states with maximal supersymmetry) in different dimensions the particle
content is calculated, i.e. the spectrum of usual Poincar{\'e} representations
in the preon representation of tensorial Poincar{\'e}. At d=4 results coincide
with (and may provide another point of view on) the Vasiliev's results in field
theories in generalized space-time. The translational subgroup of little groups
of massless particles and branes is shown to be (and coincide with, at d=4) a
subgroup of little groups of "pure branes" algebras, i.e. tensorial
Poincar{\'e} algebras without vector generators. At 11d it is shown that,
contrary to lower dimensions, spinors are not homogeneous space of Lorentz
group, and one have to distinguish at least 7 different kinds of preons.
