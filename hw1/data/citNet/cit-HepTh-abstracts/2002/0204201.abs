  Five-brane distributions with no strong coupling problems and high symmetry
are studied. The simplest configuration corresponds to a spherical shell of
branes with S^3 geometry and symmetry. The equations of motions with
delta-function sources are carefully solved in such backgrounds. Various other
brane distributions with sixteen unbroken supercharges are described. They are
associated to exact world-sheet superconformal field theories with domain-walls
in space-time. We study the equations of gravitational fluctuations, find
normalizable modes of bulk 6-d gravitons and confirm the existence of a mass
gap. We also study the moduli of the configurations and derive their
(normalizable) wave-functions. We use our results to calculate in a
controllable fashion using holography, the two-point function of the stress
tensor of little string theory in these vacua.
