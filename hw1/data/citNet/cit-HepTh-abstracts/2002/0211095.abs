  We present a new approach to the quantization of the superstring. After a
brief review of the classical Green-Schwarz formulation for the superstring and
Berkovits' approach to its quantization based on pure spinors, we discuss our
formulation without pure spinor constraints. In order to illustrate the ideas
on which our work is based, we apply them to pure Yang-Mills theory. In the
appendices, we include some background material for the Green-Schwarz and
Berkovits formulations, in order that this presentation be self contained.
