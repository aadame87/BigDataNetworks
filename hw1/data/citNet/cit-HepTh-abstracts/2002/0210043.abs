  We consider a general N=(2,2) non-linear sigma model with a torsion. We show
that the consistency of N=(2,2) supersymmetry implies that the target manifold
is necessary equipped with two (in general, different) Poisson structures.
Finally we argue that the Poisson geometry of the target space is a
characteristic feature of the sigma models with extended supersymmetry.
