  The SL(2, R) WZW model of strings on an ADS3 background is investigated in
the spirit of J.Maldacena's and H.Ooguri's approach (hep-th/0001053) and
(hep-th/0005183). Choosing a standard, but most general three-variable
parametrization of the SL(2, R) group element g, the system of equations for
the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) relations is analysed. In the investigated
SL(2, R) case, this system is consistent if each three points on the complex
plane lie on a certain hypersurface in CP3. A system of three nonlinear
first-order differential equations has been obtained for the parametrization
functions. It was demonstrated also how the mathematical apparatus of
generalized functions and integral geometry can be implemented in order to
modify the integral operators, entering the Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras.
