  The properties of the Das-Popowicz Moyal momentum algebra that we introduce
in hep-th/0207242 are reexamined in details and used to discuss some aspects of
integrable models and 2d conformal field theories. Among the results presented,
we setup some useful convention notations which lead to extract some non
trivial properties of the Moyal momentum algebra. We use the particular
sub-algebra sl(n)-{Sigma}_{n}^{(0,n)} to construct the sl(2)-Liouville
conformal model and its sl(3)-Toda extension. We show also that the central
charge, a la Feigin-Fuchs, associated to the spin-2 conformal current of the
(theta)-Liouville model is given by c(theta)=1+24.theta^{2}. Moreover, the
results obtained for the Das-Popowicz Mm algebra are applied to study
systematically some properties of the Moyal KdV and Boussinesq hierarchies
generalizing some known results. We discuss also the primarity condition of
conformal $w_{\theta}$-currents and interpret this condition as being a
dressing gauge symmetry in the Moyal momentum space. Some computations related
to the dressing gauge group are explicitly presented.
