  In this paper we represent the cutting rules for the perturbative unitarity
in the language of the Hopf algebras. First, we sketch the axioms of the Hopf
algebra and explain them with an example: the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra in
Zimmermann's sense. Then we construct the Hopf algebras hinted by the circled
graphs, the circling rules and the cutting rules. In the appendix, we give an
introduction to the cutting rules.
