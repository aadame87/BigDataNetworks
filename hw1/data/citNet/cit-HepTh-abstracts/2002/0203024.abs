  We study in some detail the properties of a previously proposed new class of
string and brane models whose world-sheet (world-volume) actions are built with
a modified reparametrization-invariant measure of integration and which do not
contain any ad hoc dimensionfull parameters. The ratio of the new and the
standard Riemannian integration measure densities plays the role of a
dynamically generated string/brane tension. The latter is identified as (the
magnitude of) an effective (non-Abelian) electric field-strength on the
world-sheet/world-volume obeying the standard Gauss-law constraint. As a result
a simple classical mechanism for confinement via strings is proposed.
