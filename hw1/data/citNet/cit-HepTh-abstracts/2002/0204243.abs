  The new approach to quantum mechanical problems is proposed. Quantum states
are represented in an algebraic program, by lists of variable length, while
operators are well defined functions on these lists. Complete numerical
solution of a given system can then be automatically obtained. The method is
applied to Wess-Zumino quantum mechanics and D=2 and D=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills quantum mechanics with the SU(2) gauge group. Convergence with
increasing size of the basis was observed in various cases. Many old results
were confirmed and some new ones, especially for the D=4 system, are derived.
Preliminary results in higher dimensions are also presented. In particular the
spectrum of the zero-volume glueballs in $ 4 < D < 11 $ is obtained for the
first time.
