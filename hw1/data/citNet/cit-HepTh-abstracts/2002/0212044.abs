  We apply stochastic quantization method to the bosonic part of IIB matrix
model, i.e., a naive zero volume limit of large N Yang-Mills theory, to
construct a collective field theory of Wilson loops. The Langevin equation for
Wilson loops can be interpreted as the time evolution of closed string fields.
The corresponding Fokker-Planck hamiltonian deduces a closed string field
theory which describes interacting Wilson loops with manifest Lorentz
invariance.
