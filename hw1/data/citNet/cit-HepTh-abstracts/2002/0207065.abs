  Existence of Bigbang singularity is considered to be the most serious
drawback in the standard FRW cosmology. Furthermore, to explain the
accelerating phase of the Universe (recently detected experimentally) in such a
model one needs to include a non-vanishing cosmological constant by hand. In
this note we show that a string originated torsion in the background spacetime
provides natural solutions to both these problems. The Universe evolving in a
torsioned spacetime is not only free of Bigbang singularity but also exhibits
acceleration during it's evolution. The role of dilaton in this context is
briefly discussed.
