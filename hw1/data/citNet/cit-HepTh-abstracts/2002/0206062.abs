  We elaborate on the symmetry breaking pattern involved in the Penrose limit
of $AdS_{d+1} \times S^{d+1}$ spacetimes and the corresponding limit of the CFT
dual. For d=2 we examine in detail how the symmetries contract to products of
rotation and Heisenberg algebras, both from the bulk and CFT points of view.
Using a free field realization of these algebras acting on products of
elementary fields of the CFT with SO(2) R charge +1, we show that this process
of contraction restricts all the fields to a few low angular momentum modes and
ensures that the field with R charge -1 does not appear. This provides an
understanding of several important aspects of the proposal of Berenstein,
Maldacena and Nastase. We also indicate how the contraction can be performed on
correlation functions.
