  We analyze the Hamiltonian of the compactified D=11 supermembrane with
non-trivial central charge in terms of the matrix model constructed recently by
some of the authors. Our main result provides a rigorous proof that the quantum
Hamiltonian of the supersymmetric model has compact resolvent and thus its
spectrum consists of a discrete set of eigenvalues with finite multiplicity.
