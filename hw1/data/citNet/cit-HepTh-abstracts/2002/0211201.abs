  It has been conjectured that string theory in a pp-wave background is dual to
a sector of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
  We study the Hagedorn transition for free strings in this background. We find
that the free energy at the transition point is finite suggesting a
confinement/deconfinement transition in the gauge theory. In the limit of
vanishing mass parameter the free energy matches that of free strings on an
8-torus with momentum/winding chemical potential. The entropy in the
microcanonical ensemble with fixed energy and fixed momentum/winding is
computed in each case.
