Title: Finite size effects and the supersymmetric sine-Gordon models
Authors: Clare Dunning
Comments: 12 pages and no figures

  We propose nonlinear integral equations to describe the groundstate energy of
the fractional supersymmetric sine-Gordon models. The equations encompass the
N=1 supersymmetric sine-Gordon model as well as the phi_(id,id,adj)
perturbation of the SU(2)_L x SU(2)_K /SU(2)_(L+K) models at rational level K.
A second set of equations are proposed for the groundstate energy of the N=2
supersymmetric sine-Gordon model.
