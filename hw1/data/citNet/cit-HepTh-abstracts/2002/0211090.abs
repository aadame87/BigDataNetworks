  We derive effective actions for Spacelike branes (S-branes) and find a
solution describing the formation of fundamental strings in the rolling tachyon
background. The S-brane action is a Dirac-Born-Infeld action for Euclidean
worldvolumes defined in the context of time-dependent tachyon condensation of
non-BPS branes. It includes gauge fields and in particular a scalar field
associated with translation along the time direction. We show that the BIon
spike solutions constructed in this system correspond to the production of a
confined electric flux tube (a fundamental string) at late time of the rolling
tachyon.
