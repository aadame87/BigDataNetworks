  We construct Wigner's continuous spin representations of the Poincar\'e
algebra for massless particles in higher dimensions. The states are labeled
both by the length of a space-like translation vector and the Dynkin indices of
the {\it short little group} $SO(d-3)$, where $d$ is the space-time dimension.
Continuous spin representations are in one-to-one correspondence with
representations of the short little group. We also demonstrate how combinations
of the bosonic and fermionic representations form supermultiplets of the
super-Poincar\'e algebra. If the light-cone translations are nilpotent, these
representations become finite dimensional, but contain zero or negative norm
states, and their supersymmetry algebra contains a central charge in four
dimensions.
