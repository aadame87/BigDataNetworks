  Recently, Klemm and others [hep-th/0104141] have successfully generalized the
Cardy-Verlinde formula for an asymptotically flat spacetime of arbitrary
dimensionality. And yet, from a holographic perspective, the interpretation of
this formula remains somewhat unclear. Nevertheless, in this paper, we
incorporate the implied flat space/CFT duality into a study on boundary
descriptions of a $d$-dimensional Schwarzschild-black hole spacetime. In
particular, we demonstrate that the (presumably) dual CFT adopts a string-like
description and, moreover, is thermodynamically equivalent to a string that
lives on the stretched horizon of the bulk black hole. Significantly, a similar
equivalence has recently been established in both an asymptotically dS and AdS
context. On this basis, we argue that the asymptotically flat Cardy-Verlinde
formula does, indeed, have a holographic pedigree.
