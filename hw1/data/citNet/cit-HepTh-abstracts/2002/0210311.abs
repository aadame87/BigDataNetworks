  We introduce a class of higher-order derivative models in (2,1) space-time
dimensions. The models are described by a vector field, and contain a
Proca-like mass term which prevents gauge invariance. We use the gauge
embedding procedure to generate another class of higher-order derivative
models, gauge-invariant and dual to the former class. We show that the results
are valid in arbitrary (d,1) space-time dimensions when one discards the
Chern-Simons and Chern-Simons-like terms. We also show that the gauge embedding
approach works appropriately when the vector field couples with fermionic
matter.
