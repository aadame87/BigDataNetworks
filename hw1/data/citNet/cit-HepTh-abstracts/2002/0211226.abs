Title: Zero Energy States of Reduced Super Yang-Mills Theories in $d+1 = 4,6$
  and 10 dimensions are necessarily $Spin(d)$ invariant
Authors: David Hasler, Jens Hoppe
\\
  We consider reduced Super Yang-Mills Theory in $d+1$ dimensions, where
$d=2,3,5,9$. We present commutators to prove that for $d=3,5$ and 9 a possible
ground state must be a $Spin(d)$ singlet. We also discuss the case $d=2$, where
we give an upper bound on the total angular momentum and show that for odd
dimensional gauge group no $Spin(d)$ invariant state exists in the Hilbert
space.
