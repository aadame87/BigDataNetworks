Title: A note on quantization of matrix models

  The issue of non-perturbative background independent quantization of matrix
models is addressed. The analysis is carried out by considering a simple matrix
model which is a matrix extension of ordinary mechanics reduced to 0 dimension.
It is shown that this model has an ordinary mechanical system evolving in time
as a classical solution. But in this treatment the action principle admits a
natural modification which results in algebraic relations describing quantum
theory. The origin of quantization is similar to that in Adler's generalized
quantum dynamics. The problem with extension of this formalism to many degrees
of freedom is solved by packing all the degrees of freedom into a single
matrix. The possibility to apply this scheme to field theory and to various
matrix models is discussed.
