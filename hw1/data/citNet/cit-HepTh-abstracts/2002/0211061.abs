  The higher dimensional analogue of the Blau-Thompson model in D=5 is
constructed by a N_T=1 topological twist of N=2, D=5 super Yang-Mills theory.
Its dimenional reduction to D=4 and D=3 gives rise to the B-model and N_T=4
equivariant extension of the Blau-Thompson model, respectively. A further
dimensional reduction to D=2 provides another example of a N_T=8 Hodge-type
cohomological theory with global symmetry group SU(2) \otimes \bar SU(2).
Moreover, it is shown that this theory possesses actually a larger global
symmetry group SU(4) and and that it agrees with the N_T=8 topological twisting
of N+16, D=2 super Yang-Mills theory.
