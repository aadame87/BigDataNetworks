  It is shown that an algebraically defined holographic projection of a QFT
onto the lightfront changes the local quantum properties in a very drastic way.
The expected ubiquitous vacuum polarization characteristic of QFT is confined
to the lightray (longitudinal) direction, whereas operators whose localization
is transversely separated are completely free of vacuum correlations. This
unexpected ''transverse return to QM'' combined with the rather universal
nature of the strongly longitudinal correlated vacuum correlations (which turn
out to be described by rather kinematical chiral theories) leads to a d-2
dimensional area structure of the d-1 dimensional lightfront theory. An
additive transcription in terms of an appropriately defined entropy related to
the vacuum restricted to the horizon is proposed and its model independent
universality aspects which permit its interpretation as a quantum candidate for
Bekenstein's area law are discussed. The transverse tensor product foliation
structure of lightfront degrees of freedom is essential for the simplifying
aspects of the algebraic lightcone holography. Key-words: Quantum field theory;
Mathematical physics, Quantum gravity
