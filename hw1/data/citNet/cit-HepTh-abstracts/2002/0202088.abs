  In hep-th/9803002, Maldacena argued that in the light of the AdS/CFT
correspondence as formulated by Witten and Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov as a
relation between partition functions, the expectation value of the Wilson loop
in $\cal N$=4 SU(N) SYM is given by the worldsheet partition function with the
action formulated on an $AdS_5\times S^5$ background and the world sheet ending
on the loop on the boundary of $AdS_5$. What we propose to do in this paper is
to provide some alternative arguments as to why it should be so.
