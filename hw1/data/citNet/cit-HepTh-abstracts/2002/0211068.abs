  We synthesize and extend the previous ideas about appearance of both
noncommutative and Finsler geometry in string theory with nonvanishing B--field
and/or anholonomic (super) frame structures \cite{vstring,vstr2,vnonc,vncf}.
There are investigated the limits to the Einstein gravity and string
generalizations containing locally anisotropic structures modeled by moving
frames. The relation of anholonomic frames and nonlinear connection geometry to
M--theory and possible noncommutative versions of locally anisotropic
supergravity and D--brane physics is discussed. We construct and analyze new
classes of exact solutions with noncommutative local anisotropy describing
anholonomically deformed black holes (black ellipsoids) in string gravity,
embedded Finsler--string two dimensional structures, solitonically moving black
holes in extra dimensions and wormholes with noncommutativity and anisotropy
induced from string theory.
