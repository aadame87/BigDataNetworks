  In the BMN approach to N=4 SYM a large class of correlators of interest are
expressible in terms of expectation values of traces of words in a
zero-dimensional Gaussian complex matrix model. We develop a loop-equation
based, analytic strategy for evaluating such expectation values to any order in
the genus expansion. We reproduce the expectation values which were needed for
the calculation of the one-loop, genus one correction to the anomalous
dimension of BMN-operators and which were earlier obtained by combinatorial
means. Furthermore, we present the expectation values needed for the
calculation of the one-loop, genus two correction.
