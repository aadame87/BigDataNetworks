  We study bulk-boundary correlators in topological open membranes. The basic
example is the open membrane with a WZ coupling to a 3-form. We view the bulk
interaction as a deformation of the boundary string theory. This boundary
string has the structure of a homotopy Lie algebra, which can be viewed as a
closed string field theory. We calculate the leading order perturbative
expansion of this structure. For the 3-form field we find that the C-field
induces a trilinear bracket, deforming the Lie algebra structure. This paper is
the first step towards a formal universal quantization of general quasi-Lie
bialgebroids.
