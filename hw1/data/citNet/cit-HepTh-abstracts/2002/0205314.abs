  We consider a family of pp-wave solutions of IIB supergravity. This family
has a non-trivial, constant 5-form flux, and non-trivial, (light-cone)
time-dependent RR and NS-NS 3-form fluxes. The solutions have either 16 or 20
supersymmetries depending upon the time dependence. One member of this family
of solutions is the Penrose limit of the solution obtained by Pilch and Warner
as the dual of a Leigh-Strassler fixed point. The family of solutions also
provides indirect evidence in support of a recent conjecture concerning a large
N duality group that acts on RG flows of N=2 supersymmetric, quiver gauge
theories.
