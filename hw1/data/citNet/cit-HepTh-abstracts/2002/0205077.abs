  It is generally believed that weak scale supersymmetry implies weak scale
supergravity, in the sense that the masses of the gravitino and gravitationally
coupled moduli have masses below 100 TeV. This paper presents a realistic
framework for supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector in which the masses
of the gravitino and gravitational moduli can be much larger. This cleanly
eliminates the cosmological problems of hidden sector models. Supersymmetry
breaking is communicated to the visible sector by anomaly-mediated
supersymmetry breaking. The framework is compatible with perturbative gauge
coupling unification, and can be realized either in models of "warped" extra
dimensions, or in strongly-coupled four-dimensional conformal field theories.
