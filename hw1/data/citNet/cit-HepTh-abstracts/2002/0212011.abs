  The multi-centre metrics are a family of euclidean solutions of the empty
space Einstein equations with self-dual curvature. For this full class, we
determine which metrics do exhibit an extra conserved quantity quadraic in the
momenta, induced by a Killing-Stackel tensor. Our results bring to light
several metrics which correspond to classically integrable dynamical systems.
They include, as particular cases, the Eguchi-Hanson and Taub-NUT metrics.
