  Based on the gauge independent decomposition of the non-Abelian gauge field
into the dual potential and the valence potential, we calculate the one loop
effective action of SU(2) QCD in an arbitrary constant monopole background,
using the background field method. Our result provides a strong evidence for a
dynamical symmetry breaking through the monopole condensation, which can induce
the dual Meissner effect and establish the confinement of color, in the
non-Abelian gauge theory. The result is obtained by separating the topological
degrees which describe the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees of
the gauge potential, and integrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD.
