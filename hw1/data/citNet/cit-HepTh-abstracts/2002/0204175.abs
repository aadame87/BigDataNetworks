  Static field classical configurations in (1+1)-dimensions for new non-linear
potential models are investigated from an isospectral potential class and the
concept of bosonic zero- mode solution. One of the models here considered has a
static non-topological configuration with a single vacuum state that breaks
supersymmetry.
