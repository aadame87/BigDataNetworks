  We study the D3/D(-1) brane system and show how to compute instanton
corrections to correlation functions of gauge theories in four dimensions using
open string techniques. In particular we show that the disks with mixed
boundary conditions that are typical of the D3/D(-1) system are the sources for
the classical instanton solution. This can then be recovered from simple
calculations of open string scattering amplitudes in the presence of
D-instantons. Exploiting this fact we also relate this stringy description to
the standard instanton calculus of field theory.
