Title: Strings in Nontrivial Gravitino and Ramond-Ramond Backgrounds
Authors: Ioannis Giannakis
Comments: 6 pages, Latex; Based on a talk given at the 10th International
  Symposium on String Theory, Towha University, Fukuoka, Japan, July 2001

  In this paper we discuss deformations of the BRST operator of the fermionic
string. These deformations preserve nilpotency of the BRST operator and
correspond to turning on infinitesimal Gravitino and Ramond-Ramond spacetime
fields.
