Title: Comment on "Relativistic extension of shape-invariant potentials"
Authors: Antonio S. de Castro
Journal-ref: J.Phys. A35 (2002) 6203-6204

  This comment directs attention to some fails of the Alhaidari approach to
solve relativistic problems. It is shown that his gauge considerations are way
off the mark and that the class of exactly solvable relativistic problems is
not so enlarged as Alhaidari thinks it is.
