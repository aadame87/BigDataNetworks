  We show explicitly by the heuristic and practical arguments that for $N = 2$
supersymmetry (SUSY) a SUSY invariant relation between component fields of a
vector supermultiplet of linear SUSY and Nambu-Goldstone fermions of the
Volkov-Akulov model of nonlinear SUSY is written by using only three arbitrary
dimensionless parameters, which can be recasted as the vacuum expectation
values of auxiliary fields in the vector supermultiplet.
