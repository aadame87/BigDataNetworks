  We study five dimensional brane physics induced by an O(2) texture formed in
one extra dimension. The model contains two 3-branes of nonzero tension, and
the extra dimension is compact. The symmetry-breaking scale of the texture
controls the particle hierarchy between the two branes. The TeV-scale particles
are confined to the negative-tension brane where the observer sees gravity as
essentially four dimensional. The effect of massive Kaluza-Klein gravitons is
suppressed.
