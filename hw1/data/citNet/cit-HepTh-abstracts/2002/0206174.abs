Title: D-branes, Orientifolds and K-theory
Authors: B. Stefanski, jr
Comments: 6 pages, to appear in the proceedings of the RTN meeting ``The
  Quantum Structure of Spacetime and the Geometric Nature of Fundamental
  Interactions'', (Corfu, September 2001)
\\
  The complete D-brane spectrum in $\Zop_2$ orientifolds is computed. Stable
non-BPS D-branes with both integral and torsion charges are found. The relation
to K-theory is discussed and a new K-theory relevant to orientifolds is
suggested.
