Title: Brane New World and dS/CFT correspondence
Authors: S.D. Odintsov
Comments: 10 pages, based on plenary talk at GRG11, Tomsk, July 2002
\\
  The occurence of 5d de Sitter space with 4d de Sitter brane is discussed on
classical and quantum level. It is shown that quantum effects maybe produced by
dual CFT living on the brane. Moreover, gravity trapping on the brane is proved
via the presentation of 5d dS gravity as 4d gravity coupled with gauge theory.
This supports the dS/CFT correspondence. Some open questions in 5d dS/4d CFT
correspondence are briefly discussed.
