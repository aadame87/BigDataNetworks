  The SW(3/2,3/2,2) superconformal algebra is a W algebra with two free
parameters. It consists of 3 superconformal currents of spins 3/2, 3/2 and 2.
The algebra is proved to be the symmetry algebra of the coset
(su(2)+su(2)+su(2))/su(2). At the central charge c=21/2 the algebra coincides
with the superconformal algebra associated to manifolds of G_2 holonomy. The
unitary minimal models of the SW(3/2,3/2,2) algebra and their fusion structure
are found. The spectrum of unitary representations of the G_2 holonomy algebra
is obtained.
