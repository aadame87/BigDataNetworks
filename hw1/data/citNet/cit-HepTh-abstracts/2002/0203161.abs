  We present a large and universal class of new boundary states which break
part of the chiral symmetry in the underlying bulk theory. Our formulas are
based on coset constructions and they can be regarded as a non-abelian
generalization of the ideas that were used by Maldacena, Moore and Seiberg to
build new boundary states for SU(N). We apply our expressions to construct
defect lines joining two conformal field theories with possibly different
central charge. Such defects can occur e.g. in the AdS/CFT correspondence when
branes extend to the boundary of the AdS-space.
