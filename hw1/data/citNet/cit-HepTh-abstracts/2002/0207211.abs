  The boundary state formalism is used to confirm predictions from
non-commutativity for the derivative corrections to the Dirac--Born--Infeld and
Chern--Simons actions, at all orders in derivatives. As anticipated by S.
Mukhi, the method applies by induction to every coupling in the Chern--Simons
action. It is also used to derive the corrections to the Dirac--Born--Infeld
action at quadratic order in the field strength.
