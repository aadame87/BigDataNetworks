  In this paper we propose a generalization of N=4 three dimensional AdS
supergravity to the noncommutative case. This is a supersymmetric version of
the results presented in hep-th/0201103. We show that it continues to admit an
N=4 supersymmetric solution which is the noncommutative couterpart of AdS_3
space. Some other solutions are also discussed.
