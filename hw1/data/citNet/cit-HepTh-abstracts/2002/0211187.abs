\\
  Refering to the supermultiplet of the supergravity(SUGRA) the linearization
of SGM action describing the nonlinear supersymmetric(NL SUSY) gravitational
interaction of superon(Nambu-Goldstone(N-G) fermion) is attempted. The field
contents of on-shell SUGRA supermultiplet are realized as the composites,
though they have new SUSY transformations which closes on super-Poincar\'e
algebra. Particular attentions are paid to the local Lorentz invariance.
