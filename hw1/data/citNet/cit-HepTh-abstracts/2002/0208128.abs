Title: On the quantum theory of pure gravitation
Authors: B. Ram
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  A quantum theory of the region of pure gravitation was given earlier in two
papers [gr-qc/9908036 (Phys. Lett. A {\bf {265}}, 1 (2000)); gr-qc/0101056]. In
this paper I provide further insight into the physics of this region.
