Title: Scalar Field Theory in the Derivative Expansion
Authors: Gordon Chalmers

\\
  The quantum correlations of scalar fields are examined as a power series in
derivatives. Recursive algebraic equations are derived and determine the
amplitudes; all loop integrations are performed. This recursion contains the
same information as the usual loop expansion. The approach is pragmatic and
generalizable to most quantum field theories.
