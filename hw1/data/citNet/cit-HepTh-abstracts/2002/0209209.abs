  Supergravity extensions of generic 2d gravity theories obtained from the
graded Poisson-Sigma model (gPSM) approach show a large degree of ambiguity. On
the other hand, obstructions may reduce the allowed range of fields as given by
the bosonic theory, or even prohibit any extension in certain cases. In our
present work we relate the finite W-algebras inherent in the gPSM algebra of
constraints to supergravity algebras (Neuveu-Schwarz or Ramond algebras resp.),
deformed by the presence of the dilaton field. With very straightforward and
natural assumptions on them --like the one linking the anti-commutator of
certain fermionic charges to the Hamiltonian constraint without deformation--
we are able not only to remove the ambiguities but, at the same time, the
singularities referred to above. Thus all especially interesting bosonic models
(spherically reduced gravity, the Jackiw-Teitelboim model etc.) under these
conditions possess a unique fermionic extension and are free from new
singularities. The superspace supergravity model of Howe is found as a special
case of this supergravity action. For this class of models the relation between
bosonic potential and prepotential does not introduce obstructions as well.
