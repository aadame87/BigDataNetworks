  We study almost-forward scattering in the context of usual and
non-commutative QED. We study the semi-classical behaviour of particles
undergoing this scattering process in the two theories, and show that the shock
wave picture, effective in QED fails for NCQED. Further, we show that whereas
in QED, there are no leading logarithmic contributions to the amplitude upto
sixth order, uncancelled logarithms appear in NCQED.
