  The Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) RG flow in the ensemble of monopoles
existing in the finite-temperature (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow model is explored in
the regime when the Higgs field is not infinitely heavy, but its mass is rather
of the same order of magnitude as the mass of the W-boson. The corrections to
the standard RG flow are derived to the leading order in the inverse mass of
the Higgs boson. According to the obtained RG equations, the scaling of the
free-energy density in the critical region and the value of the critical
temperature of the phase transition are found to be unaffected by the
finiteness of the Higgs-boson mass. The evolution of the Higgs mass itself is
also investigated and shown to be rather weak, that enables one to treat this
parameter as a constant. The same analysis is further performed in the
SU(N)-case at N>2, where the RG invariance is demonstrated to hold only
approximately, in a certain sense. Modulo this approximation, the critical
behaviour of the SU(N)-model turns out to be identical to that of the
SU(2)-one.
