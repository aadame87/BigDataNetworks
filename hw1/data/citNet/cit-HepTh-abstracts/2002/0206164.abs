  We demonstrate the equivalence of all loop closed topological string
amplitudes on toric local Calabi-Yau threefolds with computations of certain
knot invariants for Chern-Simons theory. We use this equivalence to compute the
topological string amplitudes in certain cases to very high degree and to all
genera. In particular we explicitly compute the topological string amplitudes
for P2 up to degree 12 and P1 x P1 up to total degree 10 to all genera. This
also leads to certain novel large N dualities in the context of ordinary
superstrings, involving duals of type II superstrings on local Calabi-Yau
three-folds without any fluxes.
