  A perturbative quantum theory of the 2-Killing vector reduction of general
relativity is constructed. Although non-renormalizable in the standard sense,
we show that to all orders of the loop expansion strict cut-off independence
can be achieved in a space of Lagrangians differing only by a field dependent
conformal factor. In particular the Noether currents and the quantum
constraints can be defined as finite composite operators. The form of the field
dependence in the conformal factor changes with the renormalization scale and a
closed formula is obtained for the beta functional governing its flow. The flow
possesses a unique fixed point at which the trace anomaly is shown to vanish.
The approach to the fixed point adheres to Weinberg's ``asymptotic safety''
scenario, both in the gravitational wave/cosmological sector and in the
stationary sector.
