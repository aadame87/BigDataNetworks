  We consider brane-induced gravity model in more than one extra dimensions,
regularized by assuming that the bulk gravity is soft in ultraviolet. We study
linear theory about flat multi-dimensional space-time and flat brane. We first
find that this model allows for violation of equivalence between gravitational
and inertial masses of brane matter. We then observe that the model has a
scalar ghost field localized near the brane, as well as quasi-localized massive
graviton. Pure tensor structure of four-dimensional gravity on the brane at
intermediate distances is due to the cancellation between the extra
polarization of the massive graviton, and the ghost. This is completely
analogous to the situation in the GRS model.
