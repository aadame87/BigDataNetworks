  We consider the low energy limit of a stack of N M-branes at finite
temperature. In this limit, the M-branes are well described, via the AdS/CFT
correspondence, in terms of classical solutions to the eleven dimensional
supergravity equations of motion. We calculate Minkowski space two-point
functions on these M-branes in the long-distance, low-frequency limit, i.e. the
hydrodynamic limit, using the prescription of Son and Starinets
[hep-th/0205051]. From these Green's functions for the R-currents and for
components of the stress-energy tensor, we extract two kinds of diffusion
constant and a viscosity. The N dependence of these physical quantities may
help lead to a better understanding of M-branes.
