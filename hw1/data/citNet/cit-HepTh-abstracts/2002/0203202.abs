  We investigate half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions of four maximally
supersymmetric D=9 massive supergravity theories obtained by Scherk-Schwarz
reduction of D=10 IIA and IIB supergravity. One of the theories does not have a
superpotential and does not allow domain wall solutions preserving any
supersymmetry. The other three theories have superpotentials leading to
half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions, one of which has zero potential but
non-zero superpotential.
  The uplifting of these domain wall solutions to ten dimensions leads to three
classes of half-supersymmetric Type IIB 7-brane solutions. All solutions within
each class are related by SL(2,R) transformations. The three classes together
contain solutions carrying all possible (quantised) 7-brane charges. One class
contains the well-known D7-brane solution and its dual partners and we provide
the explicit solutions for the other two classes. The domain wall solution with
zero potential lifts up to a half-supersymmetric conical space-time.
