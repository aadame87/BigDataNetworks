  We present a qualitative model of the Coulomb branch of the moduli space of
low-energy effective N=2 SQCD with gauge group SU(3) and up to five flavours of
massive matter. Overall, away from double cores, we find a situation broadly
similar to the case with no matter, but with additional complexity due to the
proliferation of extra BPS states. We also include a revised version of the
pure SU(3) model which can accommodate just the orthodox weak coupling
spectrum.
