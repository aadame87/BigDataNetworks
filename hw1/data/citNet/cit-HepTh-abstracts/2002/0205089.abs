  Recently, Berenstein et al. have proposed a duality between a sector of N=4
super-Yang-Mills theory with large R-charge J, and string theory in a pp-wave
background. In the limit considered, the effective 't Hooft coupling has been
argued to be lambda'=g_{YM}^2 N/J^2=1/(mu p^+ alpha')^2. We study Yang-Mills
theory at small lambda' (large mu) with a view to reproducing string
interactions. We demonstrate that the effective genus counting parameter of the
Yang-Mills theory is g_2^2=J^4/N^2=(4 pi g_s)^2 (mu p^+ alpha')^4, the
effective two-dimensional Newton constant for strings propagating on the
pp-wave background. We identify g_2 sqrt{lambda'} as the effective coupling
between a wide class of excited string states on the pp-wave background. We
compute the anomalous dimensions of BMN operators at first order in g_2^2 and
lambda' and interpret our result as the genus one mass renormalization of the
corresponding string state. We postulate a relation between the three-string
vertex function and the gauge theory three-point function and compare our
proposal to string field theory. We utilize this proposal, together with
quantum mechanical perturbation theory, to recompute the genus one energy shift
of string states, and find precise agreement with our earlier computation.
