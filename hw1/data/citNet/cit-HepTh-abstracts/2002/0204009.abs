  Two-dimensional hybrid superstring on singular Calabi-Yau manifolds is
studied by the field redefinition of the NSR formalism. The compactification on
singular Calabi-Yau fourfold is described by N=2 super-Liouville theory and N=2
Landau-Ginzburg models. We examine the world-sheet topological N=4
superconformal algebra, which is useful to identify physical states of the
theory. It is shown that the space-time superconformal symmetry is not
compatible with this original topological algebra. A new model is proposed by
modifying the topological superconformal generators, which is consistent with
space-time N=2 superconformal symmetry.
