  We study vortex-creating, or monopole, operators in 3d CFTs which are the
infrared limit of N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric QEDs in three dimensions. Using
large-Nf expansion, we construct monopole operators which are primaries of
short representations of the superconformal algebra. Mirror symmetry in three
dimensions makes a number of predictions about such operators, and our results
confirm these predictions. Furthermore, we argue that some of our large-Nf
results are exact. This implies, in particular, that certain monopole operators
in N=4 d=3 SQED with Nf=1 are free fields. This amounts to a proof of 3d mirror
symmetry in a special case.
