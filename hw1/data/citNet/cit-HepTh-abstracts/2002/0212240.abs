  We discuss the (dual-)gauge transformations and BRST cohomology for the two
$(1 + 1)$-dimensional (2D) free Abelian one-form and four ($3 + 1)$-dimensional
(4D) free Abelian 2-form gauge theories by exploiting the (co-)BRST symmetries
(and their corresponding generators) for the Lagrangian densities of these
theories. For the 4D free 2-form gauge theory, we show that the changes on the
antisymmetric polarization tensor $e^{\mu\nu} (k)$ due to (i) the (dual-)gauge
transformations corresponding to the internal symmetry group, and (ii) the
translation subgroup T(2) of the Wigner's little group, are connected with
each-other for the specific relationships among the parameters of these
transformation groups. In the language of BRST cohomology defined w.r.t. the
conserved and nilpotent (co-)BRST charges, the (dual-)gauge transformed states
(that are connected with the transformations on the polarization tensor by the
translation subgroup of the Wigner's little group) turn out to be the sum of
the original state and the (co-)BRST exact states. We comment on (i) the
quasi-topological nature of the 4D free 2-form gauge theory from the degrees of
freedom count on $e^{\mu\nu} (k)$, and (ii) the Wigner's little group and the
BRST cohomology for the 2D one-form gauge theory {\it vis-{\`a}-vis} our
analysis for the 4D 2-form gauge theory.
