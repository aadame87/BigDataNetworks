  In the Berkooz-Douglas matrix model of M theory in the presence of
longitudinal $M5$-brane, we investigate the effective dynamics of the system by
considering the longitudinal $M5$-brane as the background and the spherical
$M5$-brane related with the other space dimensions as the probe brane. Due to
there exists the background field strength provided by the source of the
longitudinal $M5$-brane, an open membrane should be ended on the spherical
$M5$-brane based on the topological reason. The formation of the bound brane
configuration for the open membrane ending on the 5-branes in the background of
longitudinal 5-brane can be used to model the 4-dimensional quantum Hall system
proposed recently by Zhang and Hu. The description of the excitations of the
quantum Hall soliton brane configuration is established by investigating the
fluctuations of $D0$-branes living on the bound brane around their classical
solution derived by the transformations of area preserving diffeomorphisms of
the open membrane. We find that this effective field theory for the
fluctuations is an SO(4) non-commutative Chern-Simons field theory. The matrix
regularized version of this effective field theory is given in order to allow
the finite $D0$-branes to live on the bound brane. We also discuss some
possible applications of our results to the related topics in M-theory and to
the 4-dimensional quantum Hall system.
