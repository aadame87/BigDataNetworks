  By studying cohomological quantum mechanics on the punctured plane,we were
led to identify (reduced) Bessel functions with homotopic loops living on the
plane.This identification led us to correspondence rules between exponentials
and Bessel functions.The use of these rules makes us retrieve known but also
new formulas in Bessel functions theory.
