  We study quantum gravity on $dS_{3}$ using the Chern-Simons formulation of
three -dimensional gravity. We derive an exact expression for the partition
function for quantum gravity on $dS_{3}$ in a Euclidean path integral approach.
We show that the topology of the space relevant for studying de Sitter entropy
is a solid torus. The quantum fluctuations of de Sitter space are sectors of
configurations of point masses taking a {\em discrete} set of values. The
partition function gives the correct semi-classical entropy. The sub-leading
correction to the entropy is logarithmic in horizon area, with a coefficient
-1. We discuss this correction in detail, and show that the sub-leading
correction to the entropy from the dS/CFT correspondence agrees with our
result. A comparison with the corresponding results for the $AdS_{3}$ BTZ black
hole is also presented.
