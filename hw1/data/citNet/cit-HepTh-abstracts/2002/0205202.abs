  Integrability in string/field theories is known to emerge when considering
dynamics in the moduli space of physical theories. This implies that one has to
look at the dynamics with respect to unusual time variables like coupling
constants or other quantities parameterizing configuration space of physical
theories. The dynamics given by variations of coupling constants can be
considered as a canonical transformation or, infinitesimally, a Hamiltonian
flow in the space of physical systems. We briefly consider here an example of
mechanical integrable systems. Then, any function $T(\vec p, \vec q)$ generates
a one-parametric family of integrable systems in vicinity of a single system.
For integrable system with several coupling constants the corresponding
"Hamiltonians" $T_i(\vec p, \vec q)$ satisfy Whitham equations and after
quantization (of the original system) become operators satisfying the
zero-curvature condition in the space of coupling constants: $$
[\frac{\partial}{\partial g_a} - \hat T_a(\hat{\vec p},\hat{\vec q}),\
\frac{\partial}{\partial g_b} - \hat T_b(\hat{\vec p},\hat{\vec q})] = 0 $$
