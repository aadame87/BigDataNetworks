  We investigate chiral anomaly for fermions in fundamental representation on
noncommutative (fuzzy) 2-sphere. In spite that this system is realized by
finite dimensional matrices and no regularization is necessary for either UV or
IR, we can reproduce the correct chiral anomaly which is consistent with the
calculations done in flat noncommutative space. Like the flat case, there are
ambiguities to define chiral currents. We define chiral currents in a
gauge-invariant way and a gauge-covariant way, and show that the corresponding
anomalous chiral Ward--Takahashi identities take different forms. The
Ward--Takahashi identity for the gauge-invariant current contains explicit
nonlocality while that for the covariant one is given by a local expression.
