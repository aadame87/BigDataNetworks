  We formulate matrix models for strings in ten dimensional pp-wave backgrounds
and for particles in eleven dimensional ones. This is done by first
characterizing the deformations of ten dimensional {\cal N}=1 SYM which are
induced by a constant bispinorial coupling $\int \bar\Psi H\Psi$ plus a minimal
purely bosonic completition and then by the appropriate dimensional reduction.
We find a whole class of new models for the matrix strings and a generalization
of the supernumerary supersymmetric models as far as the matrix theory for
particles is concerned. A companion deformation of the IKKT matrix model is
also discussed.
