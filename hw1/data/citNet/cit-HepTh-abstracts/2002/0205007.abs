  We consider static solutions of the sine-Gordon theory defined on a cylinder,
which can be either periodic or quasi-periodic in space. They are described by
the different modes of a simple pendulum moving in an inverted effective
potential and correspond to its libration or rotation. We review the
decomposition of the solutions into an oscillatory sum of alternating kinks and
anti-kinks or into a monotonic train of kinks, respectively, using properties
of elliptic functions. The two sectors are naturally related to each other by a
modular transformation, whereas the underlying spectral curve of the model can
be used to express the energy of the static configurations in terms of contour
integrals \`a la Seiberg-Witten in either case. The stability properties are
also examined by means of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, where we find that
the unstable configurations are associated to singular superpotentials, thus
allowing for negative modes in the spectrum of small fluctuations.
