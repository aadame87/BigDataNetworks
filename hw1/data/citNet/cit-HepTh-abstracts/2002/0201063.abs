  We consider radion stabilization in hyperbolic brane-world scenarios. We
demonstrate that in the context of Einstein gravity, matter fields which
stabilize the extra dimensions must violate the null energy condition. This
result is shown to hold even allowing for FRW-like expansion on the brane. In
particular, we explicitly demonstrate how one putative source of stabilizing
matter fails to work, and how others violate the above condition. We speculate
on a number of ways in which we may bypass this result, including the effect of
Casimir energy in these spaces. A brief discussion of supersymmetry in these
backgrounds is also given.
