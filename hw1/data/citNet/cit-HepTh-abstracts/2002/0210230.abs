  We show the existence of classical solutions of a system of D3-branes
oriented at an arbitrary angle with respect to each other, in a six dimensional
pp-wave background obtained from AdS_3\times S^3\times R^4, with NS-NS and R-R
3-form field strength. These D-brane bound states are shown to preserve 1/16 of
the supersymmetries. We also present more D-brane bound state solutions by
applying T-duality symmetries. Finally, the probe analysis is discussed along
with a brief outline of the open string construction.
