  Stability and instability bands in classical mechanics are well-studied in
connection with systems such as described by the Mathieu equation. We examine
whether such band structure can arise in classical field theory in the context
of an embedded kink in 1+1 dimensions. The static embedded kink is unstable to
perturbations but we show that if the kink is dynamic it can exhibit stability
in certain parameter bands. Our results are relevant for estimating the
lifetimes of various embedded defects and, in particular, loops of electroweak
Z-string.
