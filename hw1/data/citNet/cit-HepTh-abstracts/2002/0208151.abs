  We introduce a particular embedding of seven dimensional self-duality
membrane equations in C^3\times R which breaks G_2 invariance down to SU(3).
The world-volume membrane instantons define SU(3) special lagrangian
submanifolds of C^3. We discuss in detail solutions for spherical and toroidal
topologies assuming factorization of time. We show that the extra dimensions
manifest themselves in the solutions through the appearance of a non-zero
conserved charge which prevents the collapse of the membrane. We find
non-collapsing rotating membrane instantons which contract from infinite size
to a finite one and then they bounce to infinity in finite time. Their motion
is periodic. These generalized complex Nahm equations, in the axially symmetric
case, lead to extensions of the continuous Toda equation to complex space.
