  We deconstruct the fifth dimension of the 5D SYM theory with SU(M) gauge
symmetry and Chern-Simons level k=M and show how the 5D moduli space follows
from the non-perturbative analysis of the 4D quiver theory. The 5D coupling
h=1/(g_5)^2 of the un-broken SU(M) is allowed to take any non-negative values,
but it cannot be continued to h<0 and there are no transitions to other phases
of the theory. The alternative UV completions of the same 5D SYM -- via M
theory on the C^3/Z_2M orbifold or via the dual five-brane web in type IIB
string theory -- have identical moduli spaces: h >= 0 only, and no flop
transitions. We claim these are intrinsic properties of the SU(M) SYM theory
with k=M.
