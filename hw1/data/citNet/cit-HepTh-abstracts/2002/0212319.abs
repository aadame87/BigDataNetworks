  We propose a new formulation for the AEther of Dirac based on a lagrangian
approach. We analyse how the presence of a particular self-interaction term in
the lagrangian lead us to a description of the aether as being a medium with
conductivity which is governed by macroscopic Maxwell equations with a
polarization tensor M_{\alpha\beta} depending on the vector potential. These
results are then applied to the analysis of the amplification of the primordial
magnetic induction in a curved background of Friedmann's geometry.
