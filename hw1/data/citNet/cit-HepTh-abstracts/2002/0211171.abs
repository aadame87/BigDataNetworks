  We review the derivation of a noncommutative version of the nonlinear sigma
model on $\CPn$ and it's soliton solutions for finite $\theta$ emphasizing the
similarities it bears to the GMS scalar field theory. It is also shown that
unlike the scalar theory, some care needs to be taken in defining the
topological charge of BPS solitons of the theory due to nonvanishing surface
terms in the energy functional. Finally it is shown that, like its commutative
analogue, the noncommutative $\CPn$-model also exhibits a non-BPS sector.
Unlike the commutative case however, there are some surprises in the
noncommutative case that merit further study.
