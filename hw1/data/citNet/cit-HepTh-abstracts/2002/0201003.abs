  The non-abelian Chern-Simons field interacting with $N$ component complex
field is treated as a constrained system using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach.
The reduced phase space Hamiltonian density is obtained without introducing
Lagrange multipliers and with out any additional gauge fixing condition. The
quantization of this system is also discussed.
