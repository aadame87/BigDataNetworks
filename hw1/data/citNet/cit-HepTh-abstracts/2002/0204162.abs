Title: A Lie-Algebra model for a noncommutative space time geometry
Authors: Bernd-Dietrich Doerfel
Comments: references added in sect. 1,2
\\
  We propose a Lie-algebra model for noncommutative coordinate and momentum
space . Based on a rigid commutation relation for the commutators of space time
operators the model is quite constrained if one tries to keep Lorentz
invariance as much as possible. We discuss the question of invariants esp. the
definition of a mass.
