  We compute the partition function of the conformal field theory on the
two-dimensional euclidean black hole background using path-integral techniques.
We show that the resulting spectrum is consistent with the algebraic
expectations for the SL(2,R)/U(1) coset conformal field theory construction. In
particular, we find confirmation for the bound on the spin of the discrete
representations and we determine the density of the continuous representations.
We point out the relevance of the partition function to all string theory
backgrounds that include an SL(2,R)/U(1) coset factor.
