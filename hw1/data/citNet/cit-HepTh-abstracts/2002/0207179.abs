  A Procedure is outlined that may be used as a starting point for a
perturbative treatment of theories with permanent confinement. By using a
counter term in the Lagrangian that renormalizes the infrared divergence in the
Coulomb potential, it is achieved that the perturbation expansion at a finite
value of the strong coupling constant may yield reasonably accurate properties
of hadrons, and an expression for the string constant as a function of the QCD
Lambda parameter.
