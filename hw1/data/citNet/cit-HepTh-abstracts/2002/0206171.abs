  We calculate mass spectrum of CHS model deformed by an exactly marginal
operator, and find that there are tachyons which are not localized in the
target space. Similar deformation is discussed in another CFT which corresponds
to separated NS5-branes. A condensation of the tachyons is briefly argued.
