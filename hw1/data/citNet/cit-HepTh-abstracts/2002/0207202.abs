Title: Effective Lagrangians for Scalar Fields and Finite Size Effects in Field
  Theory
Authors: M. I. Caicedo and N. F. Svaiter
\\
  We discuss the approach of effective field theory on a d-dimensional
Euclidean space in a scalar theory with two different mass scales in the
presence of flat surfaces. Then considering Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions, we implement the renormalization program in the lambda phi^{4}
theory in a region bounded by two parallel hyperplanes in the one-loop
approximation.
