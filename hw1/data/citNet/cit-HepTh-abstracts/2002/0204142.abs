Title: Liouville Perturbation Theory

\\
  A comparison is made between proposals for the exact three point function in
Liouville quantum field theory and the nonperturbative weak coupling expansion
developed long ago by Braaten, Curtright, Ghandour, and Thorn. Exact agreement
to the order calculated (i.e. up to and including corrections of order
O(g^{10})) is found.
