Title: An Elementary (Pseudo)Scalar at all scales

  We consider an extended linear $\sigma $ model in which the fermions are
quarks and are coupled to gluons. Equivalently, this is QCD extended by
coupling the quarks to a colour singlet chiral multiplet of ($ \sigma, \vec \pi
$) fields. This theory has a phase governed by a UV fixed point where all
couplings are AF (asymptotically free). This implies that the scalars are
elementary at high energies (UV) and, as they are colour singlets, they are not
confined at low energy (IR). Thus, the scalar particles are elementary at all
scales.
