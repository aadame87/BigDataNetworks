  We write in superspace the lagrangian containing the fourth power of the Weyl
tensor in the "old minimal" d=4, N=2 supergravity, without local SO(2)
symmetry. Using gauge completion, we analyze the lagrangian in components. We
find out that the auxiliary fields which belong to the Weyl and compensating
vector multiplets have derivative terms and therefore cannot be eliminated
on-shell. Only the auxiliary fields which belong to the compensating nonlinear
multiplet do not get derivatives and could still be eliminated; we check that
this is possible in the leading terms of the lagrangian. We compare this result
to the similar one of "old minimal" N=1 supergravity and we comment on possible
generalizations to other versions of N=1,2 supergravity.
