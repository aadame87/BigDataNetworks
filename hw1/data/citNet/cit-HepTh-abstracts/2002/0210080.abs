  We analyze the possibility of constructing a supersymmetric invariant that
contains the $R^4$ term among its components as a superpotential term in type
IIB on-shell superspace. We consider a scalar superpotential, i.e. an arbitrary
holomorphic function of a chiral scalar superfield. In general, IIB superspace
does not allow for the existence of chiral superfields, but the obstruction
vanishes for a specific superfield, the dilaton superfield. This superfield
contains all fields of type IIB supergravity among its components, and its
existence is implied by the solution of the Bianchi identities. The
construction requires the existence of an appropriate chiral measure, and we
find an obstruction to the existence of such a measure. The obstruction is
closely related to the obstruction for the existence of chiral superfields and
is non-linear in the fields. These results imply that the IIB superinvariant
related to the $R^4$ term is not associated with a scalar chiral
superpotential.
