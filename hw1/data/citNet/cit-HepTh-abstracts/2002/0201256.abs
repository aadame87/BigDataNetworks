  String and M-theory realizations of brane world supersymmetry breaking
scenarios are considered in which visible sector Standard Model fields are
confined on a brane, with hidden sector supersymmetry breaking isolated on a
distant brane. In calculable examples with an internal manifold of any volume
the Kahler potential generically contains brane--brane non-derivative contact
interactions coupling the visible and hidden sectors and is not of the no-scale
sequestered form. This leads to non-universal scalar masses and without
additional assumptions about flavor symmetries may in general induce dangerous
sflavor violation even though the Standard Model and supersymmetry branes are
physically separated. Deviations from the sequestered form are dictated by bulk
supersymmetry and can in most cases be understood as arising from exchange of
bulk supergravity fields between branes or warping of the internal geometry.
Unacceptable visible sector tree-level tachyons arise in many models but may be
avoided in certain classes of compactifications. Anomaly mediated and gaugino
mediated contributions to scalar masses are sub-dominant except in special
circumstances such as a flat or AdS pure five--dimensional bulk geometry
without bulk vector multiplets.
