  It has recently been suggested that, in a large N limit, a particular four
dimensional gauge theory is indistinguishable from the six dimensional CFT with
(0,2) supersymmetry compactified on a torus. We give further evidence for this
correspondence by studying the Seiberg-Witten curve for the "deconstructed"
theory and demonstrating that along the reduced Coulomb branch of moduli space
(on the intersection of the Higgs and Coulomb branches) it describes the low
energy physics on a stack of M5-branes on a torus, which is the (0,2) theory on
a torus as claimed. The M-theory construction helps to clarify the enhancement
of supersymmetry in the deconstructed theory at low energies, and demonstrates
its stability to radiative and instanton corrections. We demonstrate the role
of the theta vacuum in the deconstructed theory. We point out that by varying
the theta parameters and gauge couplings in the deconstructed theory, the
complex structure of the torus can be chosen arbitrarily, and the torus is not
metrically S^1 x S^1 in general.
