  We show that the entanglement between inner and outer particles, with respect
to the event horizon, is the microscopic origin of the black hole entropy. Due
to the non-unitarity of the mapping between the vacua in the flat and the
curved frames, this entanglement is very robust. The holographic nature of the
entropy is recovered in a quantum field theoretical setting, and it is shown
that, at microscopic level, the responsible for the dimensional reduction of
the degrees of freedom is the Hawking effect.
