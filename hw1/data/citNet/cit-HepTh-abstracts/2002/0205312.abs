  We study the Euclidean effective action and the full fermion propagator for a
Dirac field in the presence of a scalar field with a domain wall defect, in 2+1
dimensions. We include quantum effects due to both fermion and scalar field
fluctuations, in a one-loop approximation. The results are interpreted in terms
of the quantum stability of the zero mode solution. We also study, for this
system, the induced `inertial' electric field for the fermions on the defect,
due to the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field.
