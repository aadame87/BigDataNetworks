  Chiral p-forms are, in fact, present in many supersymmetric and supergravity
models in two, six and ten dimensions. In this work, the dual projection
procedure, which is essentially equivalent to a canonical transformation, is
used to diagonalize some theories in D=2 (0-forms). The dual projection
performed here provides an alternative way of gauging the chiral components
without the necessity of constraints. It is shown, through the dual projection,
that the nonmover field (the noton) initially introduced by Hull to cancel out
the Siegel anomaly, has non-Abelian, PST and supersymmetric formulations.
