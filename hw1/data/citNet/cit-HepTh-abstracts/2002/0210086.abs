  We report results on the construction of cosmological braneworld models in
the context of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, which include the leading
correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action suggested by superstring theory. We
obtain and study the equations governing the dynamics of the standard
cosmological models. We find that they can be written in the same form as in
the case of the Randall-Sundrum model but with time-varying four-dimensional
gravitational and cosmological constants. Finally, we discuss the cosmological
evolution predicted by these models and their compatibility with observational
data.
