  Looking for string vacua with fixed moduli, we study compactifications of
type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau fourfolds in the presence of generic
Ramond-Ramond fields. We explicitly derive the (super)potential induced by
Ramond-Ramond fluxes performing a Kaluza-Klein reduction of the ten-dimensional
effective action. This can be conveniently achieved in a formulation of the
massive type IIA supergravity where all Ramond-Ramond fields appear in a
democratic way. The result agrees with the general formula for the
superpotential written in terms of calibrations. We further notice that for
generic Ramond-Ramond fluxes all geometric moduli are stabilized and one finds
non-supersymmetric vacua at positive values of the scalar potential.
