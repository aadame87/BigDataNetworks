Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in scalar light-front field theories
Authors: L. Martinovic

  A quantum treatment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in scalar light front
field theories is formulated. It is based on a finite-volume quantization with
antiperiodic boundary conditions for scalar fields. This avoids a necessity to
solve the zero mode constraint and simultaneously enables one to define a
unitary operator which shifts the scalar field by a constant. The operator
transforms the light-front vacuum into a coherent-state vacuum that minimizes
the light front energy and leads to a spontaneous breakdown of the discrete or
continuous symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Simple theories of a self-interacting
real scalar field in two dimensions and of a complex scalar field in three
dimensions are analyzed in this way including a discussion of the Goldstone
theorem.
