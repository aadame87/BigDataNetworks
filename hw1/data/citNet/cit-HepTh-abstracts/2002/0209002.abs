  In this note we update the discussion of the BMN correspondence and string
interactions in hep-th/0205089 to incorporate the effects of operator mixing.
We diagonalize the matrix of two point functions of single and double trace
operators, and compute the eigen-operators and their anomalous dimensions to
order g_2^2 \lambda'. Surprisingly, operators in different R symmetry
multiplets remain degenerate at this order. We also calculate the corresponding
energy shifts in string theory, and find a discrepancy with field theory
results, indicating possible new effects in light-cone string field theory.
