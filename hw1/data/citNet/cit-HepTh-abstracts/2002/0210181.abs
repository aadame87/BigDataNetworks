  We have analyzed the interplay between Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking
and general fermion (gaugino or gravitino) mass terms localized on the fixed
point branes of the S^1/Z_2 orbifold. Analytic solutions for eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues are found in all cases. All results are checked by numerical
calculations that make use of regularized \delta-functions. Odd and generically
also even fermions are discontinuous at the brane fixed points, but in all
cases the combination that couples to the brane is continuous. For CP-even
brane mass terms supersymmetry restoration can take place when their effects
are cancelled by those of Scherk-Schwarz compactification. However such a
cancellation can not occur for CP-odd brane mass terms.
