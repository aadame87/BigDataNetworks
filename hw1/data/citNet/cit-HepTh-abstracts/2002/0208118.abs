Title: Quantum groups and quantum field theory: I. The free scalar field
Authors: Christian Brouder and Robert Oeckl
Comments: 22 pages, no figures

  The quantum field algebra of real scalar fields is shown to be an example of
infinite dimensional quantum group. The underlying Hopf algebra is the
symmetric algebra S(V) and the product is Wick's normal product. Two
coquasitriangular structures can be built from the two-point function and the
Feynman propagator of scalar fields to reproduce the operator product and the
time-ordered product as twist deformations of the normal product. A
correspondence is established between the quantum group and the quantum field
concepts. On the mathematical side the underlying structures come out of Hopf
algebra cohomology.
