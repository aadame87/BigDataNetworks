Title: On (2+1) Dimensional Topologically Massive Non-linear Electrodynamics
Authors: M. Slusarczyk and A. Wereszczynski
Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX
\\
  The (2+1) dimensional non-linear electrodynamics, the so called
Pagels--Tomboulis electrodynamics, with the Chern--Simons term is considered.
We obtain "generalized self--dual equation" and find the corresponding
generalized massive Chern--Simons Lagrangian. Similar results for (2+1) massive
dilaton electrodynamics have been obtained.
