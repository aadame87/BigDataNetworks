  We consider C/Z_N and C^2/Z_N orbifolds of heterotic string theories and Z_N
orbifolds of AdS_3. We study theories with N=2 worldsheet superconformal
invariance and construct RG flows. Following Harvey, Kutasov, Martinec and
Moore, we compute g_cl and show that it decreases monotonically along RG flows-
as conjectured by them. For the heterotic string theories, the gauge degrees of
freedom do not contribute to the computation of g_cl.
