Title: New Deformation of ${\cal N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills Theory

  We propose a new algebraic deformation of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM via decomposition
of spinor and scalar fields in vector supermultiplet. This decomposition
generates degrees of freedom of usual quarks and leptons and the deformation
model is a low energy effective model. We show that supersymmetry is broken in
certain limit and the deformation model reduces to a SM-like model, or a
QCD-like model. Meanwhile, gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken by
nontrivial supersymmetry vacuum.
