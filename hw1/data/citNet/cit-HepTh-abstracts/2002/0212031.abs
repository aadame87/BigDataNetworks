  By introducing an appropriate parent action and considering a perturbative
approach, we establish, up to fourth order terms in the field and for the full
range of the coupling constant, the equivalence between the noncommutative
Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory and the noncommutative, non-Abelian Self-Dual
model. In doing this, we consider two different approaches by using both the
Moyal star-product and the Seiberg-Witten map.
