  The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method is employed for the study of the
integrable critical $RSOS(q_{1}, q_{2};q)$ model. The high and low temperature
behavior are investigated, and the central charge of the effective conformal
field theory is derived. The obtained central charge is expressed as the sum of
the central charges of two generalized coset models.
