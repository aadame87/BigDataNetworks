  We investigate the behaviour of a model with two oppositely charged scalar
fields. In the Bogomol'nyi limit this may be seen as the scalar sector of N=1
supersymmetric QED, and it has been shown that cosmic strings form. We examine
numerically the model out of the Bogomol'nyi limit, and show that this remains
the case. We then add supersymmetry-breaking mass terms to the supersymmetric
model, and show that strings still survive.
 Finally we consider the extension to N=2 supersymmetry with
supersymmetry-breaking mass terms, and show that this leads to the formation of
stable cosmic strings, unlike in the unbroken case.
