  generalized regularization

\\
  Nonconfining Schwinger Model [AR] is studied with a one parameter class of
kinetic energy like regularization. It may be thought of as a generalization
over the regularization considered in [AR]. Phasespace structure has been
determined in this new situation. The mass of the gauge boson acquires a
generalized expression with the bare coupling constant and the parameters
involved in the regularization. Deconfinement scenario has become transparent
at the quark-antiquark potential level.
