  According to the holography principle (due to G.`t Hooft, L. Susskind, J.
Maldacena, et al.), quantum gravity and string theory on certain manifolds with
boundary can be studied in terms of a conformal field theory on the boundary.
Only a few mathematically exact results corroborating this exciting program are
known. In this paper we interpret from this perspective several constructions
which arose initially in the arithmetic geometry of algebraic curves. We show
that the relation between hyperbolic geometry and Arakelov geometry at
arithmetic infinity involves exactly the same geometric data as the Euclidean
AdS_3 holography of black holes. Moreover, in the case of Euclidean AdS_2
holography, we present some results on bulk/boundary correspondence where the
boundary is a non-commutative space.
