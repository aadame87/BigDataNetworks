  We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for Type A N-fold
supersymmetry by direct calculation of the intertwining relation and show the
complete equivalence between this analytic construction and the sl(2)
construction based on quasi-solvability. An intimate relation between the pair
of algebraic Hamiltonians is found. The classification problem on Type A N-fold
supersymmetric models is investigated by considering the invariance of both the
Hamiltonians and N-fold supercharge under the GL(2,K) transformation. We
generalize the Bender-Dunne polynomials to all the Type A N-fold supersymmetric
models without requiring the normalizability of the solvable sector. Although
there is a case where weak orthogonality of them is not guaranteed, this fact
does not cause any difficulty on the generalization. It is shown that the
anti-commutator of the Type A N-fold supercharges is expressed as the critical
polynomial of them in the original Hamiltonian, from which we establish the
complete Type A N-fold superalgebra. A novel interpretation of the critical
polynomials in view of polynomial invariants is given.
