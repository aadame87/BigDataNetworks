Authors: Jose D. Edelstein
Comments: 9 pages, sc3conf.sty; Invited talk at the 3rd Sakharov International
  Conference, Moscow, June 24-29, 2002. To appear in the Proceedings

  We review some aspects of the gravity duals of supersymmetric gauge theories,
arising in the world-volume of D-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles of
special holonomy manifolds, within the framework of lower dimensional gauged
supergravity.
