  We compute the Euclidean actions of a d-dimensional charged rotating black
brane both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble through the use of
AdS/CFT correspondence, and show that the logarithmic divergencies associated
to the Weyl anomalies and matter field vanish. We obtain a Smarr-type formula
for the mass as a function of the entropy, the angular momentum and the
electric charge, and show that these quantities satisfy the first law of
thermodynamics. Using the conserved quantities and the Euclidean actions, we
calculate the thermodynamics potentials of the system in terms of the
temperature, the angular velocity and the electric potential both in the
canonical and grand-canonical ensemble. We also perform a stability analysis
both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble, and show that the
system is thermally stable. This is in commensurable with the fact that there
is no Hawking-Page phase transition for black object with zero curvature
horizon. Finally, we obtain the logarithmic correction of the entropy due to
the thermal fluctuation around the equilibrium.
