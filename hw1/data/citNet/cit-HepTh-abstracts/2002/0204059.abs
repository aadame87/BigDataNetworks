  A direct relation between two types of topological field theories,
Chern-Simons theory and BF theory, is presented by using ``Generalized
Differential Calculus'', which extends an ordinary p-form to an ordered pair of
p and (p+1)-form. We first establish the generalized Chern-Weil homomormism for
generalized curvature invariant polynomials in general even dimensional
manifolds, and then show that BF gauge theory can be obtained from the action
which is the generalized second Chern class with gauge group G. Particularly
when G is taken as SL(2,C) in four dimensions, general relativity with
cosmological constant can be derived by constraining the topological BF theory.
