  We study branes and orientifolds on the group manifold of SO(3). We consider
particularly the case of the equatorial branes, which are projective planes. We
show that a Dirac-Born-Infeld action can be defined on them, although they are
not orientable. We find that there are two orientifold projections with the
same spacetime action, which differ by their action on equatorial branes.
