  For $M$-theory on the $G_2$ holonomy manifold given by the cone on ${\bf
S^3}\x {\bf S^3}$ we consider the superpotential generated by membrane
instantons and study its transformations properties, especially under monodromy
transformations and triality symmetry. We find that the latter symmetry is,
essentially, even a symmetry of the superpotential. As in Seiberg/Witten
theory, where a flat bundle given by the periods of an universal elliptic curve
over the $u$-plane occurs, here a flat bundle related to the Heisenberg group
appears and the relevant universal object over the moduli space is related to
hyperbolic geometry.
