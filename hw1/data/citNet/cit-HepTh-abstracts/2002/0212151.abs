Title: Brane Gas Cosmology, M-theory and Little String Theory

  We generalize the Brane Gas Cosmological Scenario to M-theory degrees of
freedom, namely $M5$ and $M2$ branes. Without brane intersections, the
Brandenberger Vafa(BV) arguments applied to M-theory degrees of freedom
generically predict a large 6 dimensional spacetime. We show that intersections
of $M5$ and $M2$ branes can instead lead to a large 4 dimensional spacetime.
One dimensional intersections in 11D is related to (2,0) little strings (LST)
on NS5 branes in type IIA. The gas regime of membranes in M-theory corresponds
to the thermodynamics of LST obtained from holography. We propose a mechanism
whereby LST living on the worldvolume of NS5 (M5)-branes wrapping a five
dimensional torus, annihilate most efficiently in 3+1 dimensions leading to a
large 3+1 dimensional spacetime. We also show that this picture is consistent
with the gas approximation in M-theory.
