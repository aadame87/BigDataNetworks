\\
  Divergent part of the one-loop effective action for the Yang-Mills theory in
a special gauge containing forth degrees of ghost fields and allowing addition
of BRST-invariant mass term is calculated by the generalized t'Hooft-Veltman
technique. The result is BRST-invariant and defines running mass, coupling
constant and parameter of the gauge.
