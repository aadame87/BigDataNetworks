  It is shown that non-commutative spaces, which are quotients of associative
algebras by ideals generated by non-linear relations of a particular type,
admit extremely simple formulae for deformed or star products. Explicit
construction of these star products is carried out. Quantum gauge theories are
formulated on these spaces, and the Seiberg-Witten map is worked out in detail.
