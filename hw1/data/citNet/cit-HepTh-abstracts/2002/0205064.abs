  In the context of gauge/gravity duality, we try to understand better the
proposed duality between the fractional D2-brane supergravity solutions of
(Nucl. Phys. B 606 (2001) 18, hep-th/0101096) and a confining 2+1 dimensional
gauge theory. Based on the similarities between this fractional D2-brane
solution and D3-brane supergravity solutions with more firmly established gauge
theory duals, we conjecture that a confining q-string in the 2+1 dimensional
gauge theory is dual to a wrapped D4-brane. In particular, the D4-brane looks
like a string in the gauge theory directions but wraps a S**3 in S**4 in the
transverse geometry. For one of the supergravity solutions, we find a near
quadratic scaling law for the tension: $T \sim q (N-q)$. Based on the tension,
we conjecture that the gauge theory dual is SU(N) far in the infrared. We also
conjecture that a quadratic or near quadratic scaling is a generic feature of
confining 2+1 dimensional SU(N) gauge theories.
