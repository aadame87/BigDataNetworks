  We construct a non-Abelian world volume effective action for a system of
multiple M-theory gravitons. This action contains multipole moment couplings to
the eleven-dimensional background potentials. We use these couplings to study,
from the microscopical point of view, giant graviton configurations where the
gravitons expand into an M2-brane, with the topology of a fuzzy 2-sphere, that
lives in the spherical part of the AdS_7 x S^4 background or in the AdS part of
AdS_4 x S^7. When the number of gravitons is large we find perfect agreement
with the Abelian, macroscopical description of giant gravitons given in the
literature.
