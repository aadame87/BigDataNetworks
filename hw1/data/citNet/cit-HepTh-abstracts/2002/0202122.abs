  A system of coupled scalar fields is introduced which possesses a spectrum of
massive single-soliton solutions. Some of these solutions are unstable and
decay into lower mass stable solitons. Some properties of the solutions are
obtained using general principles including conservations of energy and
topological charges. Rest energies are calculated via a variational scheme, and
the dynamics of the coupled fields are obtained by solving the field equations
numerically.
