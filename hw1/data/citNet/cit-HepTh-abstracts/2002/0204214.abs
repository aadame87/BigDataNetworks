  Low energy theorems of Nambu-Goldstone fermion associated with spontaneously
broken supersymmetry are studied for gauge supermultiplets. Two possible terms
in the effective Lagrangian are needed to deal with massless gaugino and/or
massless gauge boson. As an illustrative example, a concrete model is worked
out which can interpolate massless as well as massive gaugino and/or gauge
boson to examine the low energy effective interaction of NG-fermion.
