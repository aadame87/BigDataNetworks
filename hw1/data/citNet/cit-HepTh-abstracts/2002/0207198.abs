  A nonlocal quantum gravity theory is presented which is finite and unitary to
all orders of perturbation theory. Vertex form factors in Feynman diagrams
involving gravitons suppress graviton and matter vacuum fluctuation loops by
introducing a low-energy gravitational scale, Lambda_{Gvac} < 2.4 X 10^{-3} eV.
Gravitons coupled to non-vacuum matter loops and matter tree graphs are
controlled by a vertex form factor with the energy scale, Lambda_{GM} < 1-10
TeV. A satellite Eotvos experiment is proposed to test a violation of the
equivalence principle for coupling of gravitons to pure vacuum energy compared
to matter.
