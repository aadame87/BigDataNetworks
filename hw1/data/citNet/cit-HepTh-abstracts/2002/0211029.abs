  We study brane embeddings in M-theory plane-waves and their supersymmetry.
The relation with branes in AdS backgrounds via the Penrose limit is also
explored. Longitudinal planar branes are originated from AdS branes while giant
gravitons of AdS spaces become spherical branes which are realized as fuzzy
spheres in the massive matrix theory.
