  We explore the physical consequences of a recently discovered class of exact
solutions to five dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. We find a number of
surprising features including: (1) In the presence of a Kaluza-Klein bubble,
there are arbitrarily large black holes with topology S^3. (2) In the presence
of a black hole or a black string, there are expanding bubbles (with de Sitter
geometry) which never reach null infinity. (3) A bubble can hold two black
holes of arbitrary size in static equilibrium. In particular, two large black
holes can be close together without merging to form a single black hole.
