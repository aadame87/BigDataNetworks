  The model of the bosonic string with the noncommutative world-sheet geometry
is proposed in the framework of Fedosov's deformation quantization. The
re-interpretation of the model in terms of bosonic string coupled to infinite
multiplet of background fields is given and the link to the W-symmetry is
discussed. For the case of d=4 Euclidean target space, the stringy counterparts
of the Yang-Mills instantons are constructed in both commutative and
noncommutative regimes.
