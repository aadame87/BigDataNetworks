  We discuss the vacuum energy density and the cosmological constant of the
dS$_5$ brane world with dilaton and radion fields. It is shown that a stable
AdS$_4$ brane can be constructed. An explicit relation between the cosmological
constants of dS$_5$ spacetime and AdS$_4$ brane is obtained. The discrete mass
spectrum in the AdS$_4$ brane is used to acquire the brane vacuum energy
density. The cosmological constant in the brane world gotten by this method is
in agreement with astronomical observations.
