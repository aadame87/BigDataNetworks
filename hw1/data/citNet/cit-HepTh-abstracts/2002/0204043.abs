Title: Marginal Deformations of N=4 SYM and of its Supersymmetric Orbifold
  Descendants
Authors: Shlomo S. Razamat
Comments: 102 pages, MSc thesis
\\
  In this thesis exactly marginal deformations of field theories living on
D3-branes at low energies are studied. These theories include
  N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and theories obtained from it via the
orbifolding procedure.
