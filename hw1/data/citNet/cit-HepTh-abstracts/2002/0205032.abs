  The dual Meissner effect scenario of confinement is analysed using exact
renormalisation group (ERG) equations. In particular, the low energy regime of
SU(2) Yang-Mills is studied in a maximal Abelian gauge. It is shown that under
general conditions the effective action derived when integrated using ERG
methods contains the relevant degrees of freedom for confinement. In addition,
the physics in the confining regime is dual to that of the broken phase of an
Abelian Higgs model.
