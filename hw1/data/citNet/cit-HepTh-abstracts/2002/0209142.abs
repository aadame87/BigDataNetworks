Title: The Effective Action For Brane Gauge Fields
Authors: T.E. Clark, M. Nitta and T. ter Veldhuis
Comments: 12 pages, no figures
\\
  The low energy effective action including gauge field degrees of freedom on a
non-BPS p=2 brane embedded in a N=1, D=4 target superspace is obtained through
the method of nonlinear realizations of the associated super-Poincare
symmetries. The invariant interactions of the gauge fields and the brane
excitation modes corresponding to the Nambu-Goldstone degrees of freedom
resulting from the broken space translational symmetry and the target space
supersymmetries are determined. Brane localized matter field interactions with
the gauge fields are obtained through the construction of the combined gauge
and super-Poincare covariant derivatives for the matter fields.
