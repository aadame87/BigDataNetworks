  We study vortex-like configurations in planar Abelian gauge models that
include a Chern-Simons term. In pure Chern-Simons Electrodynamics, for
instance, such objects appear as point-like magnetic vortices. Then, although
giving rise to finite flux, they yield divergent magnetic energy. As it is
well-known, such a scenario is deeply changed whenever Higgs mechanism takes
place and local symmetry is spontaneously broken down. Now, soliton-like
configurations carry finite energy, as well. On the other hand, even in the
simpler, say, Maxwell-Chern-Simons framework, the dynamical (Maxwell) term is
shown to modify the point-like structure of the pure Chern-Simons vortices.
Indeed, we have seen that the magnetic field naturally acquires a smooth
behavior (quite similar to the Nielsen-Olensen solution in (3+1) dimensions),
providing finite magnetic flux and energy for this sort of vortex. It is also
identified a ``magnetic symmetry'' between a point-like charge and an
azytmuthal-type current: namely, these configurations yield the same magnetic
field. Furthermore, we tackle the case in which a spinless particle interacts
non-minimally with a charge-vortex composite, so that an analogue of the
Aharonov-Casher effect comes out from our considerations. In our case, such a
phase depends upon mass and distance parameters, which naturally suggests us an
way for measuring Chern-Simons parameter.
