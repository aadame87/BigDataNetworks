  Nonlinear sigma models (NLSM) in d=3 have many interesting and non-trivial
features, which were explored poorly in contrast with NLSM in d=2 and d=4. We
present a few results from our study of the perturbative and non-perturbative
properties of three-dimensional (3D) NLSM. i) We have shown that cancellation
of ultra-violet (UV) divergences takes place in 3D extended (N=2,4)
supersymmetric NLSM in low orders of the 1/n expansion. ii) We consider
noncommutative extension of the 3D CP(n) model, and study low-energy dynamics
of BPS solitons in this model. We also discuss briefly dynamics of non-BPS
solutions.
