  It is well known that the building blocks for state sum models of quantum
gravity are given by 6j and 10j symbols. In this work we study the asymptotics
of these symbols by using their expressions as group integrals. We carefully
describe the measure involved in terms of invariant variables and develop new
technics in order to study their asymptotics. Using these technics we compute
the asymptotics of the various Euclidean and Lorentzian 6j-symbols. Finally we
compute the asymptotic expansion of the 10j symbol which is shown to be
non-oscillating in agreement with a recent result of Baez et al. We discuss the
physical origin of this behavior and a way to modify the Barrett-Crane model in
order to cure this disease.
