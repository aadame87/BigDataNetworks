  We study the superstring vacua constructed from the conformal field theories
of the type H_4 x M, where H_4 denotes the super Nappi-Witten model (super WZW
model on the 4-dimensional Heisenberg group H_4) and M denotes an arbitrary N=2
rational superconformal field theory with c=9. We define (type II) superstring
vacua with 8 supercharges, which are twice as many as those on the backgrounds
of H_4 x CY_3. We explicitly construct as physical vertices the space-time SUSY
algebra that is a natural extension of H_4 Lie algebra. The spectrum of
physical states is classified into two sectors: (1) strings freely propagating
along the transverse plane of pp-wave geometry and possessing the integral
U(1)_R-charges in M sector, and (2) strings that do not freely propagate along
the transverse plane and possess the fractional U(1)_R-charges in M. The former
behaves like the string excitations in the usual Calabi-Yau compactification,
but the latter defines new sectors without changing the physics in ``bulk''
space. We also analyze the thermal partition functions of these systems,
emphasizing the similarity to the DLCQ string theory. As a byproduct we prove
the supersymmetric cancellation of conformal blocks in an arbitrary unitary N=2
SCFT of c=12 with the suitable GSO projection.
