  In light of the recent work by Sen and Gibbons, we present a phase-plane
analysis on the cosmology containing a rolling tachyon field in a potential
resulted from string theory. We show that there is no stable point on the
phase-plane, which indicated that there is a coincidence problem if one
consider tachyon as a candidate of quintessence. Furthermore, we also analyze
the phase-plane of the cosmology containing a rolling tachyon field for an
exactly solvable toy potential in which the critical point is stable.
Therefore, it is possible for rolling tachyon to be quintessence if one give up
the strict constraint on the potential or find a more appropriate effective
potential for the tachyon from M/string theory.
