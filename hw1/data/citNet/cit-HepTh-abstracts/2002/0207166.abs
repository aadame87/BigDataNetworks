  We find non-BPS solutions of the noncommutative CP^1 model in 2+1 dimensions.
These solutions correspond to soliton anti-soliton configurations. We show that
the one-soliton one-anti-soliton solution is unstable when the distance between
the soliton and the anti-soliton is small. We also construct time-dependent
solutions and other types of solutions.
