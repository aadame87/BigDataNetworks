  The TST-dual of the general 1/4-supersymmetric D2-brane supertube is
identified as a 1/4-supersymmetric IIA `supercurve': a string with arbitrary
transverse displacement travelling at the speed of light. A simple proof is
given of the classical upper bound on the angular momentum, which is also
recovered as the semi-classical limit of a quantum bound. The classical bound
is saturated by a `superhelix', while the quantum bound is saturated by a
bosonic oscillator state in a unique SO(8) representation.
