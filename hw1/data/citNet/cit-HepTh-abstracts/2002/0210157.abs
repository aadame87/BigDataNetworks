  We review various aspects of configurations of intersecting branes, including
the conditions for preservation of supersymmetry. In particular, we discuss the
projection conditions on the Killing spinors for given brane configurations and
the relation to calibrations. This highlights the close connection between
intersecting branes and branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles as well as
special holonomy manifolds. We also explain how these conditions can be used to
find supergravity solutions without directly solving the Einstein equations.
The description of intersecting branes is considered both in terms of the brane
worldvolume theories and as supergravity solutions. There are well-known simple
procedures (harmonic function rules) for writing down the supergravity
solutions for supersymmetric configurations of orthogonally intersecting
branes. However, such solutions involve smeared or delocalised branes. We
describe several methods of constructing solutions with less smearing,
including some fully localised solutions. Some applications of these
supergravity solutions are also considered - in particular the study of black
holes and gauge theories.
