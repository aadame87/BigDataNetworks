  The history of discovery of bosonic string theory is well documented. This
theory evolved as an attempt to find a multidimensional analogue of Euler's
beta function. Such an analogue had in fact been known in mathematics
literature at least in 1922 and was studied subsequently by mathematicians such
as Selberg, Weil and Deligne among others. The mathematical interpretation of
this multidimensional beta function is markedly different from that described
in physics literature. This paper aims to bridge the gap between the existing
treatments. Preserving all results of conformal field theories intact,
developed formalism employing topological, algebro-geometric, number-theoretic
and combinatorial metods is aimed to provide better understanding of the
Veneziano amplitudes and, thus, of string theories.
