Title: Heat trace asymptotics defined by transfer boundary conditions
Authors: Peter Gilkey, Klaus Kirsten and Dmitri Vassilevich
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  We compute the first 5 terms in the short-time heat trace asymptotics
expansion for an operator of Laplace type with transfer boundary conditions
using the functorial properties of these invariants.
