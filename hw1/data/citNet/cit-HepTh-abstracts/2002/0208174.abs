  We advocate a framework for constructing perturbative closed string
compactifications which do not have large-radius limits. The idea is to augment
the class of vacua which can be described as fibrations by enlarging the
monodromy group around the singular fibers to include perturbative stringy
duality symmetries. As a controlled laboratory for testing this program, we
study in detail six-dimensional (1,0) supersymmetric vacua arising from
two-torus fibrations over a two-dimensional base. We also construct some
examples of two-torus fibrations over four-dimensional bases, and comment on
the extension to other fibrations.
