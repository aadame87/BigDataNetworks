  We consider N=2 moose/quiver gauge theories corresponding to N_1 D3-branes at
a C^2/Z_{N_2} singularity in the ``large moose'' limit where N_1 and N_2 are
scaled to infinity together. In the dual holographic description, this scaling
gives rise to a maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background with a compact
light-cone direction. We identify the gauge theory operators that describe the
Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) of the string in this background. For
each discrete light-cone momentum and winding sector there is a separate ground
state and Fock space. The large moose/quiver diagram provides a useful
graphical representation of the string and its excitations. This representation
has a natural explanation in a T-dual language. The dual theory is a
non-relativistic type IIA string wound around the T-dual direction, and bound
by a quadratic Newtonian potential. We end with some comments on
D-string/D-particle states, a possible lift to M-theory and the relation to
deconstruction.
