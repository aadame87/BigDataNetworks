Title: First order phase transition and corrections to its parameters in the
  O(N) - model

  The temperature phase transition in the $N$-component scalar field theory
with spontaneous symmetry breaking is investigated using the method combining
the second Legendre transform and with the consideration of gap equations in
the extrema of the free energy. After resummation of all super daisy graphs an
effective expansion parameter, $(1/2N)^{1/3}$, appears near $T_c$ for large
$N$. The perturbation theory in this parameter accounting consistently for the
graphs beyond the super daisies is developed. A certain class of such diagrams
dominant in 1/N is calculated perturbatively. Corrections to the
characteristics of the phase transition due to these contributions are obtained
and turn out to be next-to-leading order as compared to the values derived on
the super daisy level and do not alter the type of the phase transition which
is weakly first-order. In the limit $N$ goes to infinity the phase transition
becomes second order. A comparison with other approaches is done.
