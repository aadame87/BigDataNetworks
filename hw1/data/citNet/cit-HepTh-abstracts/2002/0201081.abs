  We show that the maximally supersymmetric pp-waves of IIB superstring and
M-theories can be obtained as a Penrose limit of the supersymmetric AdS x S
solutions. In addition we find that in a certain large tension limit, the
geometry seen by a brane probe in an AdS x S background is either Minkowski
space or a maximally supersymmetric pp-wave.
