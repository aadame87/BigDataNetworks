  Recently we have presented a new physical model that links the maximum speed
of light with the minimal Planck scale into a maximal-acceleration Relativity
principle in phase spaces . The maximal proper-acceleration bound is $a = c^2/
\Lambda$ where $ \Lambda$ is the Planck scale. The group transformation laws of
this Maximal-acceleration Relativity theory under velocity and acceleration
boosts are analyzed in full detail. For pure acceleration boosts it is shown
that the minimal Planck-areas (maximal tension) are universal invariant
quantities in any frame of reference. The implications of this minimal
Planck-area (maximal tension) principle in future developments of string
theory, $ W$-geometry and Quantum Gravity are briefly outlined.
