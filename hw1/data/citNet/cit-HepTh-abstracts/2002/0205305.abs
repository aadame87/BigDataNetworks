  We deal with the presence of topological defects in models for two real
scalar fields. We comment on defects hosting topological defects, and we search
for explicit defect solutions using the trial orbit method. As we know, under
certain circumstances the second order equations of motion can be solved by
first order differential equations. In this case we show that the trial orbit
method can be used very efficiently to obtain explicit solutions.
