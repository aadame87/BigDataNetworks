Title: Integrable scattering theories with unstable particles

  We formulate a new bootstrap principle which allows for the construction of
particle spectra involving unstable as well as stable particles. We comment on
the general Lie algebraic structure which underlies theories with unstable
particles and propose several new scattering matrices. We find a new Lie
algebraic decoupling rule, which predicts the renormalization group flow in
dependence of the relative ordering of the resonance parameters. The proposals
are exemplified for some concrete theories which involve unstable particles,
such as the homogeneous sine-Gordon models and their generalizations. The new
decoupling rule can be validated by means of our new bootstrap principle and
also via the renormalization group flow, which we obtain from a thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz analysis.
