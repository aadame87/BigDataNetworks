  We analyze some consequences of two possible interpretations of the action of
the ladder operators emerging from generalized Heisenberg algebras in the
framework of the second quantized formalism. Within the first interpretation we
construct a quantum field theory that creates at any space-time point particles
described by a q-deformed Heisenberg algebra and we compute the propagator and
a specific first order scattering process. Concerning the second one, we draw
attention to the possibility of constructing this theory where each state of a
generalized Heisenberg algebra is interpreted as a particle with different
mass.
