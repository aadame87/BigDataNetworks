Title: Cosmological Brane Perturbations
Authors: Karim A. Malik
Comments: 4 pages, to appear in proceedings of the Moriond Workshop "The
  Cosmological Model", 16-23 March 2002
\\
  Two approaches to the study of cosmological perturbations in the brane-world
scenario are compared: the first uses the 5D equations directly whereas the
second approach projects them onto the 4D brane and then uses the effective 4D
equations.
