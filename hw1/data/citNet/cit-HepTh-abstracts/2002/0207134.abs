Title: A new, exact, gauge-invariant RG-flow equation

  We introduce a scale-dependent effective action defined through a partial
Legendre transform first discussed by Zumino more than 30 years ago. This new
effective action depends, at any scale, on all degrees of freedom, is
gauge-invariant/general-covariant, and obeys a simple, exact and manifestly
gauge-invariant RG-flow equation. It should be useful in a variety of problems,
including some pertaining to non-abelian gauge theories and quantum gravity.
