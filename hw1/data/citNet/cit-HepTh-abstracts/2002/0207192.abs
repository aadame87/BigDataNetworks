Title: Do Neutral Elementary Particles Exist?
Authors: Felix Lev
Comments: 30 pages, Latex

  We consider massless elementary particles in quantum theory based on a Galois
field (GFQT). In our recent paper hep-th/0206078 where the GFQT has been
discussed in detail, it has been shown that the theory possesses a new symmetry
between particles and antiparticles, which has no analog in the standard
approach. In the present paper we prove that the symmetry is compatible with
all the operators describing massless particles. As a consequence, the
existence of massless neutral elementary particles in the GFQT is incompatible
with the usual relation between spin and statistics (in particular, this
implies that in the GFQT, the photon and the graviton can be only composite
particles). We argue that the same statement is also valid for neutral
particles with arbitrary masses.
