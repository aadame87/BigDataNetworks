  We compute the moduli space metric of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory with N=2
supersymmetry in the vicinity of the point where the classical moduli vanish.
This gauge theory may be realized as a set of N D7-branes wrapping a K3
surface, near the enhancon locus. The moduli space metric determines the
low-energy worldvolume dynamics of the D7 branes near this point, including
stringy corrections. Non-abelian gauge symmetry is not restored on the
worldvolume at the enhancon point, but rather the gauge group remains
U(1)^{N-1} and light electric and magnetically charged particles coexist. We
also study the moduli space metric for a single probe brane in the background
of N-1 branes near the enhancon point. We find quantum corrections to the
supergravity probe metric that are not suppressed at large separations, but are
down by 1/N factors, due to the response of the N-1 enhancon branes to the
probe. A singularity appears before the probe reaches the enhancon point where
a dyon becomes massless. We compute the masses of W-bosons and monopoles in a
large N limit near this critical point.
