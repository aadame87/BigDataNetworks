  The spontaneous symmetry breaking of rotational O(N) symmetry in
noncommutative field theory is investigated in a 2+1 dimensional model of
scalar fields coupled through a combination of quartic and sextuple
self-interactions. There are five possible orderings of the fields in the
sextuple interaction and two for the quartic interaction. At one loop, we prove
that for some choices of these orderings there is the absence of IR/UV mixing
and the appearance of massless excitations. A supersymmetric extension of the
model is also studied. Supersymmetry puts additional constraints on the
couplings but for any given N there is a Moyal ordering of the superfields for
which the requirement for the existence of Goldstone bosons is satisfied. For
some ordering and when N goes to infinity we find evidence that the model is
renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory. We also consider a generic
chiral model in 3+1 dimensions whose superpotential is invariant under local
gauge transformations. We find that for any value of N there is no one loop
correction to the pion mass and that, at two loops, there are no pion mass
corrections for slowly varying superfields so that Goldstone theorem holds
true. We also find a new purely noncommutative coupling which gives
contributions starting at order N-2 loops.
