  We construct quantum mechanical models which mimic many features of string
theory. We use these models to gain improved descriptions of B fields and
gerbes. We examine analogs of T duality, D branes, and mirror symmetry and
derive quantum mechanical analogs of standard phenomena, such as the
noncommutative geometry induced by a B field.
