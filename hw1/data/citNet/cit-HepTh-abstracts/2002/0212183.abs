Title: YM on the dielectric brane: a D0-brane tale
Authors: Luca Martucci, Pedro J. Silva
Comments: 15 pages

  In this letter we present a derivation, from the D0-brane picture, of the
background monopole field and in general of the full dynamics of the Yang-Mills
theory on the dielectric D2-brane of Myers. To do this we study the large N
limit of the fuzzy sphere relevant to the dielectric solution. In contrast to
the usual interpretation, where the commutative D2-brane picture arises
directly from the large N limit of the D0-brane picture, we find that a
residual non-commutativity must be preserved, in order to make the connection
by means of the Seiberg-Witten map.
