  We consider axially symmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) multimonopoles in
Brans-Dicke theory for winding number n > 1. In analogy to the spherically
symmetric n=1 solutions, we find that the axially symmetric solutions exist for
higher values of the gravitational coupling than in the pure Einstein gravity
case. For large values of the gravitational coupling, the solutions collapse to
form a black hole which outside the horizon can be described by an extremal
Reissner-Nordstrom solution. Similarly as in the pure Einstein gravity case,
like-charged monopoles reside in an attractive phase in a limited domain of
parameter space. However, we find that the strength of attraction is decreasing
for decreasing Brans-Dicke parameter.
