Title: A New Interpretation of the Seiberg Witten Map
Authors: Subir Ghosh (Indian Statistical Institute)
Comments: Introductory part at the beginning has been elaborated and reference
  section has been enlarged
\\
  In an alternative interpretation, the Seiberg-Witten map is shown to be
induced by a field dependent co-ordinate transformation connecting
noncommutative and ordinary space-times. Furthermore, following our previous
ideas, it has been demonstrated here that the above (field dependent
co-ordinate) transformation can occur naturally in the Batalin-Tyutin extended
space version of the relativistic spinning particle model, (in a particular
gauge). There is no need to postulate the space-time non-commutativity in an
{\it ad hoc} way: It emerges from the spin degrees of freedom.
