  In this PhD thesis the low energy effective actions for D-branes and the
M5-brane are used to analyze the dynamics of brane probes moving in the
geometry created by diverse supergravity backgrounds. It begins with an
introduction to string theory. Brane effective actions with local kappa
symmetry are also reviewed. We then study the embedding of D(8-p)-branes in the
background geometry of parallel Dp-branes. A BPS condition is found and the
analytical solutions describe embeddings which represent branes joined by
tubes, which are bundles of fundamental strings. We continue with the analysis
of branes partially wrapped on spheres in the near-horizon geometry of branes
and bound states. There is a finite number of static configurations as a
consequence of a quantization rule for the worldvolume gauge field. These
configurations can be interpretated as bound states and this is checked
directly in a particular case by using the Myers polarization mechanism.
Finally we find configurations of brane probes which behave as massless
particles in the geometry of non-threshold bound states. They can be
interpreted as gravitons blown up into a fuzzy sphere and sharing some
directions with the background.
