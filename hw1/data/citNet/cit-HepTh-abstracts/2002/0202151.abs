  Surface states are open string field configurations which arise from Riemann
surfaces with a boundary and form a subalgebra of the star algebra. We find
that a general class of star algebra projectors arise from surface states where
the open string midpoint reaches the boundary of the surface. The projector
property of the state and the split nature of its wave-functional arise because
of a nontrivial feature of conformal maps of nearly degenerate surfaces.
Moreover, all such projectors are invariant under constant and opposite
translations of their half-strings. We show that the half-string states
associated to these projectors are themselves surface states. In addition to
the sliver, we identify other interesting projectors. These include a butterfly
state, which is the tensor product of half-string vacua, and a nothing state,
where the Riemann surface collapses.
