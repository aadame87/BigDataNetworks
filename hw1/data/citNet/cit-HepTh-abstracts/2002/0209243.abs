Title: Modular functions and Ramanujan sums for the analysis of 1/f noise in
  electronic circuits
Authors: Michel Planat
Comments: weakly expanded version of an invited paper at ICNF 2003
\\
  A number theoretical model of $1/f$ noise found in phase locked loops is
developed. The dynamics of phases and frequencies involved in the nonlinear
mixing of oscillators and the low-pass filtering is formulated thanks to the
rules of the hyperbolic geometry of the half plane. A cornerstone of the
analysis is the Ramanujan sums expansion of arithmetical functions found in
prime number theory, and their link to Riemann hypothesis.
