  We investigate a method to evaluate quasi-normal modes of D3-brane black
holes by wave interpretation of fields on D3-brane based on the Feynman's
space-time approach. We perturbatively solve the wave equation which describes
propagation of a dilaton wave in a bulk space and its interaction with the
D3-brane. The obtained condition for the quasi-normal modes are qualitatively
equivalent to that evaluated in the usual scattering of the dilaton in the
black 3-brane spacetime in the corresponding supergravity description.
