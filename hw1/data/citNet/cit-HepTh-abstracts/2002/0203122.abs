  We consider a Dirac equation set on an extended spin space that contains
fermion and boson solutions. At given dimension, it determines the scalar
symmetries. The standard field equations can be equivalently written in terms
of such degrees of freedom, and are similarly constrained. At 9+1 dimensions,
the SU(3) X SU(2)_L X U(1) gauge groups emerge, as well as solution
representations with quantum numbers of related gauge bosons, leptons, quarks,
Higgs-like particles and others as lepto-quarks. Information on the coupling
constants is also provided; e. g., for the hypercharge g'=(1/2) sqrt(3/5) ~
>.387, at tree level.
