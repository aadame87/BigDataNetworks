  Peierls brackets are part of the space-time approach to quantum field theory,
and provide a Poisson bracket which, being defined for pairs of observables
which are group invariant, is group invariant by construction. It is therefore
well suited for combining the use of Poisson brackets and the full
diffeomorphism group in general relativity. The present paper provides an
introduction to the topic, with applications to field theory and point
Lagrangians.
