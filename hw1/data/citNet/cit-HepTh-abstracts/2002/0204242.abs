  We consider spacetime with torsion in a Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario where
torsion, identified with the rank-2 Kalb-Ramond field, exists in the bulk
together with gravity. While the interactions of both graviton and torsion in
the bulk are controlled by the Planck mass, an additional exponential
suppression comes for the torsion zero-mode on the visible brane. This may
serve as a natural explanation of why the effect of torsion is so much weaker
than that of curvature on the brane. The massive torsion modes, on the other
hand, are correlated with the corresponding gravitonic modes and may be
detectable in TeV-scale experiments.
