Title: Duality in non-commutative gauge theories as a non-perturbative
  Seiberg-Witten map

  We study the equivalence/duality between various non-commutative gauge models
at the classical and quantum level. The duality is realised by a linear
Seiberg-Witten-like map. The infinitesimal form of this map is analysed in more
details.
