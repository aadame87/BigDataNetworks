  We show that in the absence of a Ramond-Ramond sector both the type IIA and
type IIB free string gases have a thermal instability due to low temperature
tachyon modes. The gas of free IIA strings undergoes a thermal duality
transition into a gas of free IIB strings at the self-dual temperature T_C. The
free heterotic string gas is a tachyon-free ensemble with gauge symmetry
SO(16)xSO(16) in the presence of a timelike Wilson line background. It exhibits
a holographic duality relation undergoing a self-dual phase transition at T_C
with positive free energy and positive specific heat. The ensemble is
thermodynamically stable with no analog of the unphysical fixed point entropy
and tachyonic modes of the pedagogically similar bosonic string gas. The type I
open and closed string gas explicitly violates thermal duality. The oneloop
free energy vanishes identically as a consequence of tadpole cancellation. We
identify the order parameter for the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition from
a low temperature gas of short open strings to a high temperature long string
phase at or below T_C.
