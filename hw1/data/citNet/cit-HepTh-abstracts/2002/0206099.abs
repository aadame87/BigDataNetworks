  A Z_2 orbifold compactification of the heterotic string is considered. The
resulting 6D GUT groups can be SO(16) or E_7 times SU(2) plus some hidden
sector groups. The N=4 supersymmetry is reduced to N=2. In particular, the
SO(16) 6D model with one spinor representation 128 can reduce to the previous
5D SO(16) or SO(14) family unification models after compactifying the sixth
dimension. To obtain one spinor, we have to take into account the left-over
center of SO(16). We also comment on the E_7 times SU(2) model.
