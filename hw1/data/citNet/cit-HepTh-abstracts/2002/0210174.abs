  The spacetime dependent lagrangian formalism of references [1-2] is used to
obtain is used to obtain a classical solution of Yang-Mills theory. This is
then used to obtain an estimate of the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs
field,{\it viz.} $\phi_{a}=A/e$, where $A$ is a constant and $e$ is the
Yang-Mills coupling (related to the usual electric charge).The solution can
also accommodate non-commuting coordinates on the boundary of the theory which
may be used to construct $D$-brane actions. The formalism is also used to
obtain the Deser-Gomberoff-Henneaux-Teitelboim results [10] for dyon charge
quantisation in abelian $p$-form theories in dimensions $D=2(p+1)$ for both
even and odd $p$. PACS: 11.15.-q,11.27.+d,11.10.Ef
