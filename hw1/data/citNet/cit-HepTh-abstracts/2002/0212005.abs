  We consider topological quantum mechanics as an example of topological field
theory and show that its special properties lead to numerous interesting
relations for topological corellators in this theory. We prove that the
generating function $\mathcal{F}$ for thus corellators satisfies the
anticommutativity equation $(\mathcal{D}- \mathcal{F})^2=0$. We show that the
commutativity equation $[dB,dB]=0$ could be considered as a special case of the
anticommutativity equation.
