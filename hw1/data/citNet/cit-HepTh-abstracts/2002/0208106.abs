  The systematization of the purely Lagrangean approach to constrained systems
in the form of an algorithm involves the iterative construction of a
generalized Hessian matrix W taking a rectangular form. This Hessian will
exhibit as many left zero-modes as there are Lagrangean constraints in the
theory. We apply this approach to a general Lagrangean in the first order
formulation and show how the seemingly overdetermined set of equations is
solved for the velocities by suitably extending W to a rectangular matrix. As a
byproduct we thereby demonstrate the equivalence of the Lagrangean approach to
the traditional Dirac-approach. By making use of this equivalence we show that
a recently proposed symplectic algorithm does not necessarily reproduce the
full constraint structure of the traditional Dirac algorithm.
