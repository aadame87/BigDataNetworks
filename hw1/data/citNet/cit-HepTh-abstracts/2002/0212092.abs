Title: Black hole entropy in string-generated gravity models
Authors: Ishwaree P. Neupane
Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, Physical Review D (Rapid Communication) version
\\
  The Euclidean action and entropy are computed in string-generated gravity
models with quadratic curvatures, and used to argue that a negative mass
extremal metric is the background for hyperbolic (k=-1) black hole spacetimes,
k being the curvature constant of the event horizon. The entropy associated
with a black hole is always positive for k=(0,1) family. The positivity of
energy condition also ensures that the k=-1 (extremal) entropy is non-negative.
