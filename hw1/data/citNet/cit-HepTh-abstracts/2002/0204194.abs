  In this talk I study the topology of mathematically idealised center
vortices, defined in a gauge invariant way as closed (infinitely thin) flux
surfaces (in D=4 dimensions) which contribute the $n^{th}$ power of a
non-trivial center element to Wilson loops when they are n-foldly linked to the
latter. In ordinary 3-space generic center vortices represent closed magnetic
flux loops which evolve in time. I show that the topological charge of such a
time-dependent vortex loop can be entirely expressed by the temporal changes of
its writhing number.
