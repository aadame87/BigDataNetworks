  We investigate how the matrix representation of SU(N) algebra approaches that
of the Poisson algebra in the large N limit. In the adjoint representation, the
(N^2-1) times (N^2-1) matrices of the SU(N) generators go to those of the
Poisson algebra in the large N limit. However, it is not the case for the N
times N matrices in the fundamental representation.
