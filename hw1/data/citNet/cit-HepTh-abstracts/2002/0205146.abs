  We study a minimally coupled tachyon field rolling down to its ground state
on the FRW brane. We construct tacyonic potential which can implements power
law inflation in the brane world cosmology. The potential turns out to be ${V_0
\phi^{-1}}$ on the brane and reduces to inverse square potential at late times
when brane corrections to the Friedmann equation become negligible. We also do
similar exercise with a normal scalar field and discover that the inverse
square potential on the brane leads to power law inflation.
