  This paper shows how to construct anomaly free world sheet actions in string
theory with $D$-branes. Our method is to use Deligne cohomology and bundle
gerbe theory to define geometric objects which are naturally associated to
$D$-branes and connections on them. The holonomy of these connections can be
used to cancel global anomalies in the world sheet action.
