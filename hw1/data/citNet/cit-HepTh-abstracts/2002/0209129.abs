  We study the commutators of the kappa-deformed Poincare Algebra (kappaPA) in
an arbitrary basis. It is known that the two recently studied doubly special
relativity theories correspond to different choices of kappaPA bases. We
present another such example. We consider the classical limit of kappaPA and
calculate particle velocity in an arbitrary basis. It has standard properties
and its expression takes a simple form in terms of the variables in the Snyder
basis. We then study the particle trajectory explicitly for the case of a
constant force. Assuming that the spacetime continuum, velocity, acceleration,
etc. can be defined only at length scales greater than x_{min} ne 0, we show
that the acceleration has a finite maximum.
