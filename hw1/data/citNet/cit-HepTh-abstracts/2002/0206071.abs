  We study the N=1 Sp(2N+2M)xSp(2N) gauge theory on a stack of N physical and M
fractional D3-branes in the background of an orientifolded conifold. The
gravity dual is a type IIB orientifold of adS_5xT^11 (with certain background
fluxes turned on) containing an O7-plane and 8 D7-branes. In the conformal case
(M=0), we argue that the alpha'^2-corrections localized on the 8 D7-branes and
the O7-plane should give vanishing contributions to the supergravity equations
of motion for the bulk fields. In the cascading case (M not equal to 0), we
argue that the alpha'^2-terms give rise to corrections which in the dual
Sp(2N+2M)xSp(2N) gauge theory can be interpreted as corrections to the
anomalous dimensions of the matter fields.
