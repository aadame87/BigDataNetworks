Title: Chern-Simons Gauge Theory coupled with BF Theory
Authors: Noriaki Ikeda

\\
  We couple three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory with BF theory and
study deformations of the theory by means of the antifield BRST formalism. We
analyze all possible consistent interaction terms for the action under physical
requirements and find a new topological field theory in three dimensions with
new nontrivial terms and a nontrivial gauge symmetry. We analyze the gauge
symmetry of the theory and point out the theory has the gauge symmetry based on
the Courant algebroid.
