  We construct the supergravity solution for fully localized D2/D6
intersection. The near horizon limit of this solution is the supergravity dual
of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions with flavor. We use this
solution to formulate mirror symmetry of 2+1 dimensional gauge theories in the
language of AdS/CFT correspondence. We also construct the supergravity dual of
a non-commutative gauge theory with fundamental matter.
