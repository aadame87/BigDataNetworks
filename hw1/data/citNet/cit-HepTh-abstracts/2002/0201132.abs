  We consider condensation of localized closed string tachyons by examining the
recent proposal of Harvey, Kutasov, Martinec, and Moore. We first observe that
the $g_{\rm cl}$ defined by HKMM does not reflect the space-time supersymmetry
when the model has the SUSY. Especially for ${\bf C}^2/{\bf Z}_N$ models,
$g_{\rm cl}$ defined by them is highly peaked along the supersymmetric points
in the space of orbifolds, which is unsatisfactory property of the "potential"
of the RG-flow. We give the modified definition of the $g_{\rm cl}$ in type II
cases such that it has a valley along the supersymmetric points in the orbifold
moduli space. New definition predicts that the processes suggested by Adams,
Polchinski and Silverstein and was argued to be forbidden by HKMM are in fact
allowed.
