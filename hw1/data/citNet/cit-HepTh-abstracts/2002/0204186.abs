  The equivalence of NS5-branes and ALF spaces under T-duality is well known.
However, a naive application of T-duality transforms the ALF space into a
smeared NS5-brane, de-localized on the dual, transverse, circle. In this paper
we re-examine this duality, starting from a two-dimensional N=(4,4) gauged
linear sigma model describing Taub-NUT space. After dualizing the circle fiber,
we find that the smeared NS5-brane target space metric receives corrections
from multi-worldsheet instantons. These instantons are identified as
Nielsen-Olesen vortices. We show that their effect is to break the isometry of
the target space, localizing the NS5-brane at a point. The contribution from
the k-instanton sector is shown to be proportional to the weighted integral of
the Euler form over the k-vortex moduli space. The duality also predicts the,
previously unknown, asymptotic exponential decay coefficient of the BPS vortex
solution.
