Title: Time-independant stochastic quantization, DS equations, and infrared
  critical exponents in QCD

  We derive the equations of time-independent stochastic quantization, without
reference to an unphysical 5th time, from the principle of gauge equivalence.
It asserts that probability distributions $P$ that give the same expectation
values for gauge-invariant observables $<W > = \int dA W P$ are physically
indistiguishable. This method escapes the Gribov critique. We derive an exact
system of equations that closely resembles the Dyson-Schwinger equations of
Faddeev-Popov theory, which we then solve non-perturbatively for the critical
exponents that characterize the asymptotic form at $k \approx 0$ of the
tranverse and longitudinal parts of the gluon propagator in Landau gauge, $D^T
\sim (k^2)^{-1-\a_T}$ and $D^L \sim a (k^2)^{-1-\a_L}$, and obtain $\a_T = -
2\a_L \approx - 1.043$ (short range), and $\a_L \approx 0.521$, (long range).
Although the longitudinal part vanishes with the gauge parameter $a$ in the
Landau gauge limit, $a \to 0$, there are vertices of order $a^{-1}$, so the
longitudinal part of the gluon propagator contributes in internal lines,
replacing the ghost that occurs in Faddeev-Popov theory. We compare our results
with the corresponding results in Faddeev-Popov theory.
