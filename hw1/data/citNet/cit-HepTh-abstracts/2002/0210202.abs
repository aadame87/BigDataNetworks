  We consider the properties of an ensemble of universes as function of size,
where size is defined in terms of the asymptotic value of the Hubble constant
(or, equivalently, the value of the cosmological constant). We assume that
standard model parameters depend upon size in a manner that we have previously
suggested, and provide additional motivation for that choice. Given these
assumptions, it follows that universes with different sizes will have different
physical properties, and we estimate, very roughly, that only if a universe has
a size within a factor of a square root of two or so of our own will it support
life as we know it. We discuss implications of this picture for some of the
basic problems of cosmology and particle physics, as well as the difficulties
this point of view creates.
