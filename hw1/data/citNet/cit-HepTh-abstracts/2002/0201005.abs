  Maxwell-Chern-Simons models in the presence of an instanton anti-instanton
background are studied. The saddle-point configuration corresponds to the
creation and annihilation of a vortex localized around the Dirac string needed
to support the nontrivial background. This configuration is generalized to the
case in which a nonlocal Maxwell term is allowed in order to fulfill the finite
action requirement. Following 't Hooft procedure, we compute the vortex
correlation functions and we study the possibility of obtaining spin 1/2
excitations. A possible connection with the bosonization of interacting
three-dimensional massive fermionic systems is also discussed.
