  We consider supersymmetric theories with a warped extra dimension where
supersymmetry is broken by boundary conditions that preserve an R-symmetry. It
is shown that this supersymmetry breaking mechanism naturally invokes the
Stuckelberg formalism for the gravitino in order to give a four-dimensional
theory with a smooth massless limit.
