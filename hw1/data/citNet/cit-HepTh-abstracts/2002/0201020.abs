  A new concept for the geometrisation of electromagnetic interaction is
proposed. Instead of the concept "extended field--point sources", interacting
Maxwell's and Dirac's fields are considered as a unified closed noneuclidean
and nonriemannean space--time 4-manifold. This manifold can be considered as
geometrical realisation of the "dressed electron" idea. Within this approach,
the Dirac equation proves to be a relation that accounts for topological and
metric characteristics of this manifold. Dirac's spinors serve as basis vectors
of its fundamental group representation, while the electromagnetic field
components prove to be components of a curvature tensor of the manifold
covering space. Energy, momentum components, mass, charge, spin and
particle--antiparticle states appear to be geometrical characteristics of the
above manifold.
