  The status of string theory is reviewed, and major recent developments -
especially those in going beyond perturbation theory in the string theory and
quantum field theory frameworks - are discussed. This analysis helps better
understand the role and place of string theory in the modern picture of the
physical world. Even though quantum field theory describes a wide range of
experimental phenomena, it is emphasized that there are some insurmountable
problems inherent in it - notably the impossibility to formulate the quantum
theory of gravity on its basis - which prevent it from being a fundamental
physical theory of the world of microscopic distances. It is this task, the
creation of such a theory, which string theory, currently far from completion,
is expected to solve. In spite of its somewhat vague current form, string
theory has already led to a number of serious results and greatly contributed
to progress in the understanding of quantum field theory. It is these
developments which are our concern in this review.
