  We analyse the spacetime structure of the global vortex and its maximal
analytic extension in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. We find that
the vortex compactifies space on the scale of the Hubble expansion of its
worldvolume, in a manner reminiscent of that of the domain wall. We calculate
the effective volume of this compactification and remark on its relevance to
hierarchy resolution with extra dimensions. We also consider strongly
gravitating vortices and derive bounds on the existence of a global vortex
solution.
