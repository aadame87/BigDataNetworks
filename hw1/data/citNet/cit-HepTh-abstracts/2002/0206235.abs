  The momentum density conjugate to a bosonic quantum field splits naturally
into the sum of a classical component and a nonclassical component. It is shown
that the field and the nonclassical component of the momentum density satisfy
an_exact_ uncertainty relation, i.e., an equality, which underlies the
Heisenberg-type uncertainty relation for fields. This motivates a new approach
to bosonic quantum fields based on an exact uncertainty principle. In
particular, the postulate that an ensemble of classical fields is subject to
nonclassical momentum fluctuations, of a strength determined by the field
uncertainty, leads from the classical to the quantum field equations. Examples
include scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields. For the latter case
the exact uncertainty principle specifies a unique (non-Laplacian) operator
ordering for the Wheeler-deWitt equation.
