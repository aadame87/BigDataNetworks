  A first principle derivation is given of the neutrino damping rate in
real-time thermal field theory. Starting from the discontinuity of the neutrino
self energy at the two loop level, the damping rate can be expressed as
integrals over space phase of amplitudes squared, weighted with statistical
factors that account for the possibility of particle absorption or emission
from the medium. Specific results for a background composed of neutrinos,
leptons, protons and neutrons are given. Additionally, for the real part of the
dispersion relation we discuss the relation between the results obtained from
the thermal field theory, and those obtained by the thermal average of the
forward scattering amplitude.
