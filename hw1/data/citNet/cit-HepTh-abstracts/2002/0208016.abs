  We study the thermodynamical observables of the 2d Ising model in the
neighborhood of the magnetic axis by means of numerical diagonalization of the
transfer matrix. In particular, we estimate the leading order corrections to
the Zamolodchikov mass spectrum and find evidence of non-vanishing
contributions due to the stress-energy tensor.
