  We analyze the hamiltonian quantization of Chern-Simons theory associated to
the universal covering of the Lorentz group SO(3,1). The algebra of observables
is generated by finite dimensional spin networks drawn on a punctured
topological surface. Our main result is a construction of a unitary
representation of this algebra. For this purpose, we use the formalism of
combinatorial quantization of Chern-Simons theory, i.e we quantize the algebra
of polynomial functions on the space of flat SL(2,C)-connections on a
topological surface with punctures. This algebra admits a unitary
representation acting on an Hilbert space which consists in wave packets of
spin-networks associated to principal unitary representations of the quantum
Lorentz group. This representation is constructed using only Clebsch-Gordan
decomposition of a tensor product of a finite dimensional representation with a
principal unitary representation. The proof of unitarity of this representation
is non trivial and is a consequence of properties of intertwiners which are
studied in depth. We analyze the relationship between the insertion of a
puncture colored with a principal representation and the presence of a
world-line of a massive spinning particle in de Sitter space.
