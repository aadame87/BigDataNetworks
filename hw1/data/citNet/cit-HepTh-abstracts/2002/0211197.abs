Title: Rotating Strings with B-field
Authors: R.C.Rashkov and K.S.Viswanathan
Comments: 20 pages

  Some of the recent important developments in understanding string/ gauge
dualities are based on the idea of highly symmetric motion of ``string
solitons'' in $AdS_5\times S^5$ geometry originally suggested by Gubser,
Klebanov and Polyakov. In this paper we study symmetric motion of short strings
in the presence of antisymetric closed string B field. We compare the values of
the energy and the spin in the case of non-vanishing B field with those
obtained in the case of B=0. The presence of NS-NS antisymmetric field couples
the fluctuation modes that indicates changes in the quantum corrections to the
energy spectrum.
