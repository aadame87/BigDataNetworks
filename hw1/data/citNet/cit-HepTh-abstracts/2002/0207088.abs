Title: Energy Eigenvalues of Kemmer Equation for a Homogeneous Magnetic Field
Authors: A. Havare, K. Sogut
Comments: 8 pages, no figures, submitted to J Phys. A: Math and Gen

  This article illustrates a completely algebraic method to obtain the energy
levels of a massive spin-1 particle moving in a constant magnetic field. In the
process to obtain the energy levels the wave function was written by harmonic
oscillator solutions.
