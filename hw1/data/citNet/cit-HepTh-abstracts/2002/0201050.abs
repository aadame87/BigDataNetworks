  We show that the apparently periodic Charap-Duff Yang-Mills `instantons' in
time-compactified Euclidean Schwarzschild space are actually time independent.
For these solutions, the Yang-Mills potential is constant along the time
direction (no barrier) and therefore, there is no tunneling. We also
demonstrate that the solutions found to date are three dimensional monopoles
and dyons. We conjecture that there are no time-dependent solutions in the
Euclidean Schwarzschild background.
