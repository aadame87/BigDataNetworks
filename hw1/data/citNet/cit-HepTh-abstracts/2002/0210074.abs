Title: Thirring sine-Gordon relationship by canonical methods

  Using the canonical method developed for anomalous theories, we present the
independent rederivation of the quantum relationship between the massive
Thirring and the sine-Gordon models. The same method offers the possibility to
obtain the Mandelstam soliton operators as a solution of Poisson brackets
"equation" for the fermionic fields. We checked the anticommutation and basic
Poisson brackets relations for these composite operators. The transition from
the Hamiltonian to the corresponding Lagrangian variables produces the known
Mandelstam's result.
