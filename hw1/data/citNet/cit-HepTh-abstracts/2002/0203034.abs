Title: Propagator for a spin 1/2 particle in terms of the unitary
  representations of the Lorentz group
Authors: Rudolf A. Frick
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  In this paper we extend our previous result on the description of the partcle
motion in a generalized Heisenberg picture to a relativistic fermion. The
operators of the Lorentz algebra in this picture may be regarded as field
operators. In this approach the transition amplitudes for the particle are
constructed in terms of two-component functions in the unitary representations
of the Lorentz group.
