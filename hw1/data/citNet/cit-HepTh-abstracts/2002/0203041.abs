  We discuss time-dependent backgrounds of type IIB supergravity realizing
gravitation duals of gauge theories formulated in de Sitter space-time as a
tool of embedding de Sitter in a supergravity. We show that only the
gravitational duals to non-conformal gauge theories are sensitive to a specific
value of a Hubble parameter. We consider two nontrivial solutions of this type:
a gravity dual to six-dimensional (1,1) little string theory, and to a
four-dimensional cascading SU(N+M)xSU(N) supersymmetric gauge theory (related
to fractional D3-branes on a singular conifold according to Klebanov et al), in
accelerating universe. In both cases we argue that the IR singularity of the
geometry is regulated by the expansion of the gauge theory background
space-time.
