  We construct Poisson brackets at boundaries of open strings and membranes
with constant background fields which are compatible with their boundary
conditions. The boundary conditions are treated as primary constraints which
give infinitely many secondary constraints. We show explicitly that we need
only two (the primary one and one of the secondary ones) constraints to
determine Poisson brackets of strings. We apply this to membranes by using
canonical transformations.
