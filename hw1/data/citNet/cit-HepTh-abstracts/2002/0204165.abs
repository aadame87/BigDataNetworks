Title: Incompressible Hydrodynamics on a Noncommutative D3-Brane

  In the Seiberg-Witten limit, the low-energy dynamics of N weakly coupled
identical open strings on a D3-brane can behave as two-dimensional
incompressible hydrodynamics. Classical vortices are frozen in the fluid and
described by an action expressed in terms of two canonical conjugate fields,
which can be taken as the new space coordinate. The noncommutative space
naturally arises when this pair of conjugate fields are quantized. To the
lowest order of $\hbar$, the vorticity can replace the background $B$-field on
the D3 brane, thereby yielding a spatially and temporally varying
noncommutative parameter $\theta^{ij}$. Demanding a quantum area-preserving
transformation between two classical inertial-frame coordinates, we identify
the classical solitons that survive in the noncommutative space, and they turn
out to be the "electric field" solutions of the Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangian
created by a $\delta$-function source. The strongly magnetized electron gas in
a semiconductor of finite thickness is taken as a case study, where similar
quantum column vortices as those in a D3 brane can be present. The electric
charges contained in these electron-gas column vortices are quantized, but in a
way different from those in the sheet vortices that produce the fractional
quantum Hall effect.
