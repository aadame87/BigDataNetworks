  We have devoted an effort to study some nonlinear actions, characteristics of
the ${\cal W}$-theories, in the framework of the soldering formalism. We have
disclosed interesting new results concerning the embedding of the original
chiral ${\cal W}$-particles in different metrical spaces in the final soldered
action, i.e., the metric gets modified by the soldering interference process.
The results are presented in a weak field approximation for the ${\cal W}_N$
case when N is greater than 3 and also in an exact way for ${\cal W}_2$. We
have promoted a generalization of the interference phenomena to ${\cal
W}_N$-theories of different chiralities and shown that the geometrical features
introduced can yield a new understanding about the interference formalism in
quantum field theories.
