  A generalization of duality transformations for arbitrary Lorentz tensors is
presented, and a systematic scheme for constructing the dual descriptions is
developed. The method, a purely Lagrangian approach, is based on a first order
parent Lagrangian, from which the dual partners are generated. In particular, a
family of theories which are dual to the massive spin two Fierz-Pauli field,
both free and coupled to an external source, is constructed in terms of a third
rank tensor which is taken as the basic configuration variable.
