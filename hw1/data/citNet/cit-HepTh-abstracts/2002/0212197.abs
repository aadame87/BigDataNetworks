  This is a very brief review of some results from hep-th/0112154 and
hep-th/0209191. In holographic renormalization, we studied the RG flow of a 2d
N=(4,4) CFT perturbed by a relevant operator, flowing to a conformal fixed
point in the IR. Here, the supergravity dual is displayed, and the computation
of correlators is discussed. The sample stress-energy correlator given here
provides an opportunity to explicitly compare Zamolodchikov's C-function to the
proposal for a "holographic C-function".
