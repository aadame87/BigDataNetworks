  We investigate the slicing dependence of the relationship between conserved
quantities in the (A)dS/CFT correspondence. Specifically, we show that the
Casimir energy depends upon the topology and geometry of spacetime foliations
of the bulk near the conformal boundary. We point out that the determination of
the brane location in brane-world scenarios exhibits a similar slicing
dependence, and we comment on this in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence
conjecture.
