  We consider the interactions between Dp-branes intersecting at an arbitrary
number of angles in the context of type II string theory. For cosmology
purposes we concentrate in the theory on R^{3,1} x T^6. Interpreting the
distance between the branes as the inflaton field, the branes can intersect at
most at two angles on the compact space. If the configuration is
non-supersymmetric we will have an interbrane potential that provides an
effective cosmological inflationary epoch at the four dimensional intersection
between the branes. The end of inflation occurs when the interbrane distance
becomes small compared with the string scale, where a tachyon develops
triggering the recombination of the branes. We study this recombination due to
tachyon instabilities and we find the possibility for the final configuration
to be again branes intersecting at two angles. This preserves the interesting
features that are present in the intersecting brane models from the string
model building point of view also after the end of inflation. This fact was not
present in the models of branes intersecting at just one angle. This kind of
recombination can be also important in other string contexts.
