Title: Some Considerations Regarding Lorentz-Violating Theories

  We investigate the compatibility of Lorentz-violating quantum field theories
with the requirements of causality and stability. A general renormalizable
model for free massive fermions indicates that these requirements are satisfied
at low energies provided the couplings controlling the breaking are small.
However, for high energies either microcausality or energy positivity or both
are violated in some observer frame. We find evidence that this difficulty can
be avoided if the model is interpreted as a sub-Planckian approximation
originating from a nonlocal theory with spontaneous Lorentz violation. The
present study thereby supports the validity of the standard-model extension as
the low-energy limit of any realistic string theory that exhibits spontaneous
Lorentz breaking.
