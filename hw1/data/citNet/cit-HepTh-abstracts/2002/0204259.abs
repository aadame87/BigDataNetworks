  We show that, at one loop, the magnetic mass vanishes at finite temperature
in QED in any dimension. In QED$_{3}$, even the zero temperature part can be
regularized to zero. We calculate the two loop contributions to the magnetic
mass in QED$_{3}$ with a Chern-Simons term and show that it vanishes. We give a
simple proof which shows that the magnetic mass vanishes to all orders at
finite temperature in this theory. This proof also holds for QED in any
dimension.
