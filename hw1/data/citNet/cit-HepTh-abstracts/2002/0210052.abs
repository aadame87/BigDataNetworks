  Measurements of radio emission from distant galaxies and quasars verify that
the polarization vectors of these radiations are not randomly oriented as
naturally expected. This peculiar phenomenon suggests that the spacetime
intervening between the source and observer may be exhibiting some sort of
optical activity, the origin of which is not known. In the present paper we
provide a plausible explanation to this phenomenon by investigating the r\^ole
played by a Chern-Simons-like term in the background of an ordinary or
superconducting screwed cosmic string in a scalar-tensor gravity. We discuss
the possibility that the excess in polarization of the light from
radio-galaxies and quasars can be understood as if the electromagnetic waves
emitted by these cosmic objects interact with a scalar-tensor screwed cosmic
string through a Chern-Simons coupling. We use current astronomical data to
constrain possible values for the coupling constant of this theory, and show
that it turns out to be: $\lambda \sim 10^{-26}$ eV, which is two orders of
magnitude larger than in string-inspired theories.
