  This is my contribution to the proceedings of Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday
celebration. If the ideas of TeV scale gravity are correct, then black holes
should be produced at accelerators that probe the TeV scale, and their decays
should evidence one of Stephen's greatest discoveries, the phenomenon of black
hole radiance.
