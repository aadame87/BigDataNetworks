  The noncommutative dipole QED is studied in detail for the matter fields in
the adjoint representation. The axial anomaly of this theory is calculated in
two and four dimensions using various regularization methods. The
Ward-Takahashi identity is proved by making use of a non-perturbative path
integral method. The one-loop $\beta$-function of the theory is calculated
explicitly. It turns out that the value of the $\beta$-function depends on the
direction of the dipole length $\vec{L}$, which defines the noncommutativity.
Finally using a semi-classical approximation a non-perturbative definition of
the form factors is presented and the anomalous magnetic moment of this theory
at one-loop order is computed.
