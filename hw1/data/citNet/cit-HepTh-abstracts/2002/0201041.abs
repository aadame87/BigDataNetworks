  We derive the corrections to the Friedmann equation of order rho^2 in the
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, where two 3-branes bound a slice of
five-dimensional Anti-deSitter space. The effects of radion stabilization by
the Goldberger-Wise mechanism are taken into account. Surprisingly, we find
that an inflaton on either brane will experience no order rho^2 corrections in
the Hubble rate H due to its own energy density, although an observer on the
opposite brane does see such a correction. Thus there is no enhancement of the
slow-roll condition unless inflation is simultaneously driven by inflatons on
both branes. Similarly, during radiation domination, the rho^2 correction to H
on a given brane vanish unless there is nonvanishing energy density on the
opposite brane. During the electroweak phase transition the correction can be
large, but is has the wrong sign for causing sphalerons to go out of thermal
equilibrium, so it cannot help electroweak baryogenesis. We discuss the
differences between our results and exact solutions in RS-II cosmology.
