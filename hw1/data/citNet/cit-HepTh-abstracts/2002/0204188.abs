  We consider the master Lagrangian of Deser and Jackiw, interpolating between
the self-dual and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Lagrangian, and quantize it
following the symplectic approach, as well as the traditional Dirac scheme. We
demonstrate the equivalence of these procedures in the subspace of the
second-class constraints. We then proceed to embed this mixed first- and
second-class system into an extended first-class system within the framework of
both approaches, and construct the corresponding generator for this extended
gauge symmetry in both formulations.
