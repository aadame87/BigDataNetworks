Title: Casimir energy for self-interacting scalar field in a spherical shell

  In this paper we calculate the Casimir energy for spherical shell with
massless self-interacting scalar filed which satisfying Dirichlet boundary
conditions on the shell. Using zeta function regularization and heat kernel
coefficients we obtain the divergent contributions inside and outside of
Casimir energy. The effect of self-interacting term is similar with existing of
mass for filed. In this case some divergent part arises. Using the
renormalization procedure of bag model we can cancel these divergent parts.
