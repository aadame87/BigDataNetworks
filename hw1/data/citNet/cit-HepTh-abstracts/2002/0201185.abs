  We conjecture that the end point of bulk closed string tachyon decay at any
non-zero coupling, is the annihilation of space time by Witten's bubble of
nothing, resulting in a topological phase of the theory. In support of this we
present a variety of situations in which there is a correspondence between the
existence of perturbative tachyons in one regime and the semi-classical
annihilation of space-time. Our discussion will include many recently
investigated scenarios in string theory including Scherk-Schwarz
compactifications, Melvin magnetic backgrounds, and noncompact orbifolds. We
use this conjecture to investigate a possible web of dualities relating the
eleven-dimensional Fabinger-Horava background with nonsupersymmetric string
theories. Along the way we point out where our conjecture resolves some of the
puzzles associated with bulk closed string tachyon condensation.
