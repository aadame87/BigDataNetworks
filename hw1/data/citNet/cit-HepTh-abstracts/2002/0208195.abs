  We discuss a concept of particle localization which is motivated from quantum
field theory, and has been proposed by Brunetti, Guido and Longo and by
Schroer. It endows the single particle Hilbert space with a family of real
subspaces indexed by the space-time regions, with certain specific properties
reflecting the principles of locality and covariance. We show by construction
that such a localization structure exists also in the case of massive anyons in
d=2+1, i.e. for particles with positive mass and with arbitrary spin s in the
reals. The construction is completely intrinsic to the corresponding ray
representation of the (proper orthochronous) Poincare group. Our result is of
particular interest since there are no free fields for anyons, which would fix
a localization structure in a straightforward way. We present explicit formulas
for the real subspaces, expected to turn out useful for the construction of a
quantum field theory for anyons. In accord with well-known results, only
localization in string-like, instead of point-like or bounded, regions is
achieved. We also prove a single-particle PCT theorem, exhibiting a PCT
operator which acts geometrically correctly on the family of real subspaces.
