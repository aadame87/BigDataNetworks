  The Lie algebra of Feynman graphs gives rise to two natural representations,
acting as derivations on the commutative Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs, by
creating or eliminating subgraphs. Insertions and eliminations do not commute,
but rather establish a larger Lie algebra of derivations which we here
determine.
