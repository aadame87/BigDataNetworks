  We consider the thermodynamic properties of $(d+1)$-dimensional spacetimes
with NUT charges. Such spacetimes are asymptotically locally anti de Sitter (or
flat), with non-trivial topology in their spatial sections, and can have fixed
point sets of the Euclidean time symmetry that are either $(d-1)$-dimensional
(called "bolts") or of lower dimensionality (pure "NUTs"). We compute the free
energy, conserved mass, and entropy for 4, 6, 8 and 10 dimensions for each,
using both Noether charge methods and the AdS/CFT-inspired counterterm
approach. We then generalize these results to arbitrary dimensionality. We find
in $4k+2$ dimensions that there are no regions in parameter space in the pure
NUT case for which the entropy and specific heat are both positive, and so all
such spacetimes are thermodynamically unstable. For the pure NUT case in $4k$
dimensions a region of stability exists in parameter space that decreases in
size with increasing dimensionality. All bolt cases have some region of
parameter space for which thermodynamic stability can be realized.
