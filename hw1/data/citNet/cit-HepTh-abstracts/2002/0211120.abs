Title: Gravitating nonabelian solutions with NUT charge
Authors: Eugen Radu
Comments: 32 pages, LaTeX, 15 Figures
\\
  We argue that the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory presents nontrivial solutions
with a NUT charge. These solutions approach asymptotically the Taub-NUT
spacetime. They are characterized by the NUT parameter, the mass and the node
numbers of the magnetic potential and present both electric and magnetic
potentials.=0D The existence of nontrivial Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions with
NUT charge in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is also
discussed. We use the counterterm subtraction method to calculate the boundary
energy-momentum tensor and the mass of these configurations. Also, dyon black
hole solutions with nonspherical event horizon topology are shown to exist for
a negative cosmological constant.
