  We construct the supergravity solution in 11 dimensions describing D6-branes
wrapped around a Kahler four-cycle with a B-field along the flat directions of
the brane. The configuration is dual to an N=2 noncommutative gauge theory in
2+1 dimensions. We also construct the four associated independent Killing
spinors. The phenomenon of supersymmetry without supersymmetry appears
naturally when compactifying to type IIA or 8d gauged supergravity. Therefore,
this solution also provides an 11d background with four supercharges and
four-form flux, which is not obtainable from 8d gauged supergravity.
