  It seems to me at this time that two recent developments may permit fast
progress on our way to understand the symmetry structure of toroidally
(compactified and) reduced M-theory. The first indication of a (possibly) thin
spot in the wall that prevents us from deriving a priori the U-duality
symmetries of these models is to be found in the analysis of the hyperbolic
billiards that control the chaotic time evolution of (quasi)homogeneous
anisotropic String, Supergravity or Einstein cosmologies near a spacelike
singularity. What happens is that U-duality symmetry controls chaos via
negative constant curvature. On the other hand it was noticed in 1982 that
(symmetrizable) ''hyperbolic'' Kac-Moody algebras have maximal rank ten,
exactly like superstring models and that two of these four rank ten algebras
matched physical theories. My second reason for optimism actually predates also
the previous breakthrough, it was the discovery in 1998 of surprising
superalgebras extending U-dualities to all (p+1)-forms (associated to
p-branes). They have a super-nonlinear sigma model structure similar to the
symmetric space structure associated to 0-forms and they obey a universal
self-duality field equation. As the set of forms is doubled to implement
electric-magnetic duality, they obey a set of first order equations. More
remains to be discovered but the beauty and subtlety of the structure cannot be
a random emergence from chaos. In fact we shall explain how a third maximal
rank hyperbolic algebra $BE_{10}$ controls heterotic cosmological chaos and how
as predicted Einstein's General Relativity fits into the general picture.
