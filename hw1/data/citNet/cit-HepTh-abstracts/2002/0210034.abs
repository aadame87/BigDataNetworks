  We propose a class of N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on the
noncompact Ricci-flat Kahler manifolds, interpreted as the complex line bundles
over the hermitian symmetric spaces. Kahler potentials and Ricci-flat metrics
for these manifolds with isometries are explicitly constructed by using the
techniques of supersymmetric gauge theories. Each of the metrics contains a
resolution parameter which controls the size of these base manifolds, and the
conical singularity appears when the parameter vanishes.
