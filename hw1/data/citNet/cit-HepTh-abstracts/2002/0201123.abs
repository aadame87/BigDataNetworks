  An analysis of CPN models is given in terms of general coordinates or
arbitrary interpolating fields.Only closed expressions made from simple
functions are involved.Special attention is given to CP2 and CP4. In the first
of these the retrieval of stereographic coordinates reveals the hermitian form
of the metric. A similar analysis for the latter case allows comparison with
the Fubini-Study metric.
