Title: Stabilization of Hyperbolic Brane-World Scenarios
Authors: Pedro J. Silva

  In this talk we consider the issue of stabilization of compact hyperbolic
brane-world scenarios from the point of view of 4-dimensional effective
theories. The idea is to clarify the status of stabilization for these models.
Possible ways to overcome a no-go theorem that appeared in a recent paper are
shown invoking the holographic framework and type IIA*/IIB* theories. A brief
discussion on supersymmetry is also given.
