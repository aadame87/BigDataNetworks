  We show how one can get solitonic strings in a six-dimensional (2,0)
supersymmetric theory by incorporating a nonlinear interaction term. We derive
a zero force condition between parallel strings, and compute a metric on a
moduli space which is $R^4$ when the strings are far apart. When compactifying
the strings on a two-torus we show that, in the limit of vanishing two-torus,
one regains the moduli space of two widely separated dyons of equal magnetic
charges in four dimensions.
