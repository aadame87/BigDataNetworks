  The complete on-shell action of topological Einstein-Maxwell gravity on
four-dimensional manifolds with SU(2) holonomy is presented. It is shown
explicitly how this theory arises from four-dimensional Euclidean N=2
supergravity. The topological BRST symmetries and twisted local Lorentz
symmetries are given and the action and stress tensor are shown to be
BRST-exact. A set of BRST-invariant topological operators is given. The vector
and antisymmetric tensor twisted supersymmetries and their algebra are also
found.
