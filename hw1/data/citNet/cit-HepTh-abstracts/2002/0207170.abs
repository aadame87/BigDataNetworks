  5-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic models with a bulk cosmological
constant and a minimally coupled scalar field are considered. We have found
that in special cases the scalar field can mimic a frustrated (i.e. disordered)
networks of topological defects: cosmic strings, domain walls and hyperdomain
walls. This equivalence enabled us to obtain 5-dimensional instantonic
solutions which can be used to construct brane-world models. In some cases,
their analytic continuation to a Lorentzian metric signature give rise to
either 4-dimensional flat or inflating branes. Models with arbitrary dimensions
(D $>$ 5) are also briefly discussed.
