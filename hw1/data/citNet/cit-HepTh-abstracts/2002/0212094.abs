Title: Noncommutative fields in curved space
Authors: J. Barcelos-Neto
Comments: 4 pages, Revtex 4, twocolumn

  We consider a noncommutative theory developed in a curved background. We show
that the Moyal product has to be conveniently modified and, consequently, some
of its old properties are lost compared with the flat case. We also address the
question of diffeomorphism symmetry.
