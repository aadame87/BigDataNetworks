  We discuss how to obtain the superpotential of the baryons and mesons for
SU(N) gauge theories with N flavour matter fields from matrix integral. We
apply the mean-field approximation for the matrix integral. Assuming the planar
limit of the self-consistency equation, we show that the result almost agrees
with the field theoretical result.
