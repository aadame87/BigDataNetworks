  It is shown that the evaluation of the expectation value (EV) of topological
charge density over $\theta$-vacuum is reduced to investigation of the
Chern-Simons term EV. An equation for this quantity is established and solved.
EV of the topological charge density at an arbitrary $\theta$ occurs equal to
zero and, as a consequence, topological susceptibility of both QCD and pure
Yang-Mills vacua defined in a Wick sense is equal to zero, whereas when defined
in a Dyson sense it differs from zero by the quantity proportional to the
respective condensate of the chromomagnetic field. Thus, the usual
Witten-Veneziano formula for the $\eta^{'}$ meson mass is modified.
