  We study the string modes in the pp-wave light-cone string field theory.
First, we clarify the discrepancy between the Neumann coefficients for the
supergravity vertex and the zero mode of the full string one. We also repeat
our previous manipulation of the prefactor for the string modes and find that
the prefactor reduces to the energy difference of the cos modes minus that of
the sin modes. Finally, we discuss off-shell three-string processes.
