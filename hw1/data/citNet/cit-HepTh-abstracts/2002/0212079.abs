  Dijkgraaf and Vafa have conjectured the correspondences between topological
string theories, ${\cal N}=1$ gauge theories and matrix models. By the use of
this conjecture, we calculate the quantum deformations of Calabi-Yau threefolds
with ADE singularities from ADE multi-matrix models. We obtain the effective
superpotentials of the dual quiver gauge theories in terms of the geometric
engineering for the deformed geometries. We find the Veneziano-Yankielowicz
terms in the effective superpotentials.
