  We study the boundary states for the rational points in the moduli spaces of
c=1 conformal and c=3/2 superconformal field theories, including the isolated
Ginsparg points. We use the orbifold and simple-current techniques to relate
the boundary states of different theories and to obtain symmetry-breaking,
non-Cardy boundary states. We show some interesting examples of fractional and
twisted branes on orbifold spaces.
