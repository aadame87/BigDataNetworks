Title: Chiral Symmetry on ${\bf S}^2_F$
Authors: Giorgio Immirzi, Badis Ydri
Comments: To appear in the Conference Proceedings : Theoretical High Energy
  Physics Conference SUNY UTICA/ROME NY, Fall 2001
\\
  In this talk we give a brief description of the formulation of chiral and
gauge symmetries on the fuzzy sphere . In particular fermion doublers are shown
to be absent and the correct anomaly equation in two dimensions is obtained in
the corresponding continuum limit .
