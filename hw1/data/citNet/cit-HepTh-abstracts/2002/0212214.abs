  The fuzzy algebra of S^4 is discussed by quantum deformation. To this end we
embed the classical S^4 in the Kaehler coset space SO(5)/U(2). The harmonic
functions of S^4 are constructed in terms of the complex coordinates of
SO(5)/U(2). Being endowed with the symplectic structure they can be deformed by
the Fedosov formalism. We show that they generate the fuzzy algebra \hat
A_\infty (S^4) under the * product defined therein, by using the Darboux
coordinate system. The fuzzy spheres of higher even dimensions can be discussed
similarly. We give basic arguments for the generalization as well.
