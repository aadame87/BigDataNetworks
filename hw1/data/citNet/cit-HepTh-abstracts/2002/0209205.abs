  We construct five different two-parameter massive deformations of the unique
nine-dimensional N=2 supergravity. All of these deformations have a
higher-dimensional origin via Scherk-Schwarz reduction and correspond to gauged
supergravities. The gauge groups we encounter are SO(2), SO(1,1)^+, R, R^+ and
the two-dimensional non-Abelian Lie group A(1), which consists of scalings and
translations in one dimension.
  We make a systematic search for half-supersymmetric domain walls and
non-supersymmetric de Sitter space solutions. Furthermore, we discuss in which
sense the supergravities we have constructed can be considered as low-energy
limits of compactified superstring theory.
