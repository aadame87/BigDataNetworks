  The nonequilibrium dynamics of coupled quantum oscillators subject to
different time dependent quenches are analyzed in the context of the
Liouville-von Neumann approach. We have studied models of quantum oscillators
in interaction that are exactly soluble in the cases of both sudden and smooth
quenches. We have determined the explicit time evolution of number densities
among other quantities, like the final equilibration temperature for the
problem of a quantum oscillator coupled to an infinity set of other
oscillators. The connection to quantum fields is briefly discussed.
