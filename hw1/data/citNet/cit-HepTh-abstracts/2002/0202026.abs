Title: Closed expression of the interaction kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter
  equation for quark-antiquark bound states

  The interaction kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter equation for quark-antiquark
bound states is derived from the Bethe-Salpeter equations satisfied by the
quark-antiquark four-point Green's function. The latter equations are
established based on the equations of motion obeyed by the quark and antiquark
propagators, the four-point Green's function and some other kinds of Green's
functions which follow directly from the QCD generating functional. The B-S
kernel derived is given an exact and explicit expression which contains only a
few types of Green's functions. This expression is not only convenient for
perturbative calculations, but also suitable for nonperturbative
investigations.
