  In this letter we show that, in five-dimensional anti-deSitter space (AdS)
truncated by boundary branes, effective field theory techniques are reliable at
high energy (much higher than the scale suggested by the Kaluza-Klein mass
gap), provided one computes suitable observables. We argue that in the model of
Randall and Sundrum for generating the weak scale from the AdS warp factor, the
high energy behavior of gauge fields can be calculated in a {\em cutoff
independent manner}, provided one restricts Green's functions to external
points on the Planck brane. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the
one-loop correction to the Planck brane gauge propagator due to charged bulk
fields. These effects give rise to non-universal logarithmic energy dependence
for a range of scales above the Kaluza-Klein gap.
