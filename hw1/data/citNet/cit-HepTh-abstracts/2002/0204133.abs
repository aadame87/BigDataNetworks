  Using a fully covariant formalism given by Carter for the deformation
dynamics of p-branes governed by the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action in a curved
background, it is proved that the corresponding Witten's phase space is endowed
with a covariant symplectic structure, which can serve as a starting point for
a phase space quantization of such objects. Some open questions for further
research are outlined.
