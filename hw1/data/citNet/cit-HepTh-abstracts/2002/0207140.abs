Title: Brane collisions and braneworld cosmology
Authors: Uchida Gen, Akihiro Ishibashi, and Takahiro Tanaka
Comments: 8 pages in Latex with the PTP style. 2 figures. To be published in
  Proceedings of the YITP workshop YITP-W-01-15 ``Braneworld - Dynamics of
  spacetime with boundary", brief comments on brane inflation and references
  added
\\
  Recently, we proposed a new braneworld model [GIT] in which the collision of
a brane universe and a vacuum bubble coming from the extra-dimension is
utilized as a trigger of brane big-bang. In this article, mainly reviewing this
model, we briefly summarize cosmological braneworld scenarios in which
collision of branes plays an important role.
