  We find examples in string theory of locally wrapped D-branes. These
excitations mimic skyrmions in that they correspond to topological excitations
of the scalar fields parametrizing the brane motion in the space transverse to
its world-volume. While these brane excitations appear to be point-like,
evidence is provided that curvature corrections to the probe action might allow
for a delocalization of the wrapping on a scale of the order of the string
length, therefore rendering the phenomena non-singular.
