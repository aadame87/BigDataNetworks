  We present new non-Abelian solitonic configurations in the low energy
effective theory describing a collection of N parallel D1--branes. These
configurations preserve 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 and 1/32 of the spacetime supersymmetry.
They are solutions to a set of generalised Nahm's equations which are related
to self-duality equations in eight dimensions. Our solutions represent
D1--branes which expand into fuzzy funnel configurations ending on collections
of intersecting D3--branes. Supersymmetry dictates that such intersecting
D3--branes must lie on a calibrated three-surface of spacetime and we argue
that the generalised Nahm's equations encode the data for the construction of
magnetic monopoles on the relevant three-surfaces.
