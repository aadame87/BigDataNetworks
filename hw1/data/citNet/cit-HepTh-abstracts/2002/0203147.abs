  We provide a world-sheet description of Neveu-Schwarz five-branes wrapped on
a complex projective space. It is an orbifold of the product of an N=2 minimal
model and the IR fixed point of a certain linear sigma model. We show how the
naked singularity in the supergravity description is resolved by the
world-sheet CFT. Applying mirror symmetry, we show that the low-energy theory
of NS5-branes wrapped on CP^1 in Eguchi-Hanson space is described by the
Seiberg-Witten prepotential for N=2 super-Yang-Mills, with the gauge group
given by the ADE-type of the five-brane. The world-sheet CFT is generically
regular, but singularities develop precisely at the Argyres-Douglas points and
massless monopole points of the space-time theory. We also study the low-energy
theory of NS5-branes wrapped on CP^2 in a Calabi-Yau 3-fold and its relation to
(2,2) super-Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions.
