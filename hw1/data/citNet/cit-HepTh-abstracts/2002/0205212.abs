Title: The cosmological constant, neutrino masses and parity symmetry in 6+1
  dimensions
Authors: Jos\'e Antonio Martins Sim\~oes
Comments: 2 pages, 1 figure. Revised version
\\
  In this paper we propose that the cosmological constant scale and neutrino
masses have a common origin: a new spontaneously broken scalar field. This
hypothesis is implemented in a 6-space dimensional model that restores the
parity symmetry. The 6-dimensional parity symmetry gives a natural mechanism
for the smallness of the vacuum energy density.
