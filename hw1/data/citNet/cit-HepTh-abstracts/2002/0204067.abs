Title: Quantum Effect of Auxiliary Fields to the Gap Equation in the
  Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model

  Quantum effect of auxiliary fields is considered for the gap equation of the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with N-component fermions in 3 as well as 4
dimensions. N is not assumed so large but regarded as a loop-expansion
parameter. The one-loop, O(1/N), contribution of auxiliary fields enhances the
chiral symmetry breaking in both cases except the massless region where loop
integrals are infrared divergent. Dependence on momentum shift, necessarily
arising in loop graphs under cutoff theories, is also studied but difference is
not significant.
