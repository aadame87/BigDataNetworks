  An iterative construction of higher order Einstein tensors for a maximally
Gauss-Bonnet extended gravitational Lagrangian was introduced in a previous
paper. Here the formalism is extended to non-factorisable metrics in arbitrary
($d+1$) dimensions in the presence of superposed Gauss-Bonnet terms. Such a
generalisation turns out to be remarkably convenient and elegant. Having thus
obtained the variational equations we first construct bulk solutions, with
nonzero and zero cosmological constant. It is also pointed out that in the
absence of Gauss-Bonnet terms a Schwarzschild type solution can be obtained in
the non-factorisable case. Two positive tension branes are then inserted and
their tensions are obtained in terms of parameters in the warp factor.
Relations to recent studies of several authors are pointed out.
