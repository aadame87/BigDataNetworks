  Magnetic monopoles having non-Abelian charges have been found recently to
play a crucial role in the infrared in a class of supersymmetric gauge
theories. We argue that these "dual quarks" can naturally be identified with
the non-Abelian magnetic monopoles of the type first discussed by Goddard,
Nuyts and Olive. Our argument is based on a few simple observations as regards
to their charge structure, flavor quantum numbers, and some general properties
of electromagnetic duality.
