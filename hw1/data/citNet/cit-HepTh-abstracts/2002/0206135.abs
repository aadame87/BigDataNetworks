Title: Quantum Field Theory and Representation Theory: A Sketch
Authors: Peter Woit (Dept. of Mathematics, Columbia University)
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Representation Theory
\\
  A sketch is given of a circle of ideas relating quantum field theories with
representation theory. The main mathematical ingredients are spinor geometry
and the gauge group equivariant K-theory of the space of connections.
