  In this note we extend previous work on massless Ramond spectra of open
strings connecting D-branes wrapped on complex manifolds, to consider D-branes
wrapped on smooth complex orbifolds. Using standard methods, we calculate the
massless boundary Ramond sector spectra directly in BCFT, and find that the
states in the spectrum are counted by Ext groups on quotient stacks (which
provide a notion of homological algebra relevant for orbifolds). Subtleties
that cropped up in our previous work also appear here. We also compare Ext
groups on quotient stacks to Ext groups associated with quivers, and we use the
McKay correspondence to relate Ext groups on quotient stacks to Ext groups on
(large radius) resolutions of the quotients. As stacks are not commonly used in
the physics community, we include pedagogical discussions of some basic
relevant properties of stacks.
