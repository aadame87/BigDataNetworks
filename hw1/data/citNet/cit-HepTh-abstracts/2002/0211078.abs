  The complex non-local action functional is used in classical electrodynamics
to describe the back-reaction effects for the charge moving in the constant
homogeneous electromagnetic field. We apply the mass-shift method to obtain the
higher order radiation effects in the non-relativistic cyclotron motion and
generalize the method to the case of Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi particle.
