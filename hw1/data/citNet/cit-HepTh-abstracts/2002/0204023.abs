  We study the N=1 Sp(2N+2M)xSp(2N) cascading gauge theory on a stack of N
physical and M fractional (half) D3-branes at the singularity of an
orientifolded conifold. In addition to the D3-branes and an O7-plane, the
background contains eight D7-branes, which give rise to matter in the
fundamental representation of the gauge group. The moduli space of the gauge
theory is analyzed and its structure is related to the brane configurations in
the dual type IIB theory and in type IIA/M-theory.
