  We derive effective equations of motion for a massless charged particle
coupled to the dynamical electromagnetic field having regard to the radiation
back reaction. It is shown that unlike the massive case not all the divergences
resulting from the self-action of the particle are Lagrangian, i.e. can be
canceled out by adding appropriate counterterms to the original action.
Besides, the order of renormalized differential equations governing the
effective dynamics turns out to be greater than the order of the corresponding
Lorentz-Dirac equation for a massive particle. For the case of homogeneous
external field the first radiative correction to the Lorentz equation is
explicitly derived via the reduction of order procedure.
