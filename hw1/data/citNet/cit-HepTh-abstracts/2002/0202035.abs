  We find that the quantum monodromy matrix associated with a derivative
nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) model exhibits U(2) or U(1,1) symmetry depending
on the sign of the related coupling constant. By using a variant of quantum
inverse scattering method which is directly applicable to field theoretical
models, we derive all possible commutation relations among the operator valued
elements of such monodromy matrix. Thus, we obtain the commutation relation
between creation and annihilation operators of quasi-particles associated with
DNLS model and find out the $S$-matrix for two-body scattering. We also observe
that, for some special values of the coupling constant, there exists an upper
bound on the number of quasi-particles which can form a soliton state for the
quantum DNLS model.
