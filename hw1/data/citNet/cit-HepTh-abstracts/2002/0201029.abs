  Orientifolds with three-form flux provide some of the simplest string
examples of warped compactification. In this paper we show that some models of
this type have the unusual feature of D=4, N=3 spacetime supersymmetry. We
discuss their construction and low energy physics. Although the local form of
the moduli space is fully determined by supersymmetry, to find its global form
requires a careful study of the BPS spectrum.
