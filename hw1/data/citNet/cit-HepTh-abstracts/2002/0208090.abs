  We study complex bosons and fermions coupled through a generalized Yukawa
type coupling in the large-N_c limit following ideas of Rajeev [Int. Jour. Mod.
Phys. A 9 (1994) 5583]. We study a linear approximation to this model. We show
that in this approximation we do not have boson-antiboson and
fermion-antifermion bound states occuring together. There is a possibility of
having only fermion-antifermion bound states. We support this claim by finding
distributional solutions with energies lower than the two mass treshold in the
fermion sector. This also has implications from the point of view of scattering
theory to this model. We discuss some aspects of the scattering above the two
mass treshold of boson pairs and fermion pairs. We also briefly present a
gauged version of the same model and write down the linearized equations of
motion.
