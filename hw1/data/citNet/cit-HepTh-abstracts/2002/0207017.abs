  We study gauge theories based on nonabelian 2-forms. Certain connections on
loop space give rise to generalized covariant derivatives that include a
nonabelian 2-form. This can be used to find rather straightforward expressions
for the field strength and gauge transformations. As a special case we recover
formulas for connections on nonabelian gerbe, as recently constructed in
mathematics. The general construction gives rise to connections on algebra
bundles, which might be relevant for D-branes in the presence of torsion. We
construct BV sigma model actions for these connections and discuss their gauge
fixing. We find both Yang-Mills type and topological BF type actions.
