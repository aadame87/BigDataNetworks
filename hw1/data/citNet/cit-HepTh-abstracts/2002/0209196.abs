  The problem of confinement of fermions in 1+1 dimensions is approached with a
linear potential in the Dirac equation by considering a mixing of Lorentz
vector and scalar couplings. Analytical bound-states solutions are obtained
when the scalar coupling is of sufficient intensity compared to the vector
coupling.
