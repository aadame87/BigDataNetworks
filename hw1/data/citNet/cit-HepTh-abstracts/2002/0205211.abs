  We investigate de Sitter/conformal field theory (dS/CFT) correspondence in
two dimensions. We define the conserved mass of de Sitter spacetime and
formulate the correspondence along the lines of anti-de Sitter/conformal field
theory duality. Asymptotic symmetry group, mass, and central charge of de
Sitter spacetime are equal to those of anti-de Sitter spacetime. The entropy of
two-dimensional de Sitter spacetime is evaluated by applying Cardy formula. We
calculate the boundary correlators induced by the propagation of the dilaton in
two-dimensional de Sitter space. Although the dilaton is a tachyonic
perturbation in the bulk, boundary conformal correlators have positive
dimension.
