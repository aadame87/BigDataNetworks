  We construct a simple non singular cosmological model in which the currently
observed expansion phase was preceded by a contraction. This is achieved, in
the framework of pure general relativity, by means of a radiation fluid and a
free scalar field having negative energy. We calculate the power spectrum of
the scalar perturbations that are produced in such a bouncing model and find
that, under the assumption of initial vacuum state for the quantum field
associated with the hydrodynamical perturbation, this leads to a spectral index
n=-1. The matching conditions applying to this bouncing model are derived and
shown to be different from those in the case of a sharp transition. We find
that if our bounce transition can be smoothly connected to a slowly contracting
phase, then the resulting power spectrum will be scale invariant.
