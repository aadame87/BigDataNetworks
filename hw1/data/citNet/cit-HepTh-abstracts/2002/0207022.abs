  In kappa-deformed relativistic framework we consider three different
definitions of kappa-deformed velocities and introduce corresponding addition
laws. We show that one of the velocities has classical relativistic addition
law. The relation of velocity formulae with the coproduct for fourmomenta and
noncommutative space-time structure is exhibited.
