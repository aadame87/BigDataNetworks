  Cachazo and Vafa provided a proof of the equivalence of $\mathcal{N}=1$
dynamics obtained by deforming $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM by addition of certain
superpotential terms, with that of type IIB superstring on Calabi-Yau manifold
with fluxes. We extend the proof to SYM with massive flavors in fundamental
representation of gauge group. For the gauge group we consider U(N) and
$SO(N)/Sp(N)$ groups. When the adding tree level superpotential is square of
adjoint chiral superfield we can derive Affleck-Dine-Seiberg potentials. By
turning off the flux, we obtain Seiberg-Witten curves of $\mathcal{N}=2$
theories.
