  We examine whether the cosmologies with varying speed of light (VSL) are
compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. We find that the VSL
cosmology with varying fundamental constant is severely constrained by the
second law of thermodynamics, whereas the bimetric cosmological models are less
constrained.
