  The semiclassical quantization conditions for all partial waves are derived
for bound states of two interacting anyons in the presence of a uniform
background magnetic field. Singular Aharonov-Bohm-type interactions between the
anyons are dealt with by the modified WKB method of Friedrich and Trost. For
s-wave bound state problems in which the choice of the boundary condition at
short distance gives rise to an additional ambiguity, a suitable generalization
of the latter method is required to develop a consistent WKB approach. We here
show how the related self-adjoint extension parameter affects the semiclassical
quantization condition for energy levels. For some simple cases admitting exact
answers, we verify that our semiclassical formulas in fact provide highly
accurate results over a broad quantum number range.
