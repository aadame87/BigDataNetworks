  We show that the Born-Infeld action with the Wess-Zumino terms for the
Ramond-Ramond fields, which is the D3-brane effective action, is a solution to
the Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equation in type IIB supergravity. Adopting the
radial coordinate as time, we develop the ADM formalism for type IIB
supergravity reduced on $S^5$ and derive the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which is
the classical limit of the Wheeler-De Witt equation and whose solutions are
classical on-shell actions. The solution to the H-J equation reproduces the
on-shell actions for the supergravity solution of a stack of D3-branes in $B_2$
field and its near-horizon limit, which is conjectured to be dual to
noncommutative Yang Mills and reduces to $AdS_5 \times S^5$ in the commutative
limit. Our D3-brane effective action is that of a probe D3-brane, and the
radial time corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field in
the dual Yang Mills. Our findings can be applied to a study of the holographic
renormalization group.
