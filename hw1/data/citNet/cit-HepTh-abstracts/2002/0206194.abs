  It is noted that a finite Penrose limit for brane probes with non-zero
worldvolume fluxes does not generically exist; this is closely related to the
observation by Blau et al that for a brane probe the Penrose limit is
equivalent to an infinite-tension limit. It is shown that when the limit
exists, however, the number of supersymmetries preserved by the probe does not
decrease.
