  We study a non local version of the sine-Gordon model connected to a
many-body system with backward and umklapp scattering processes. Using
renormalization group methods we derive the flow equations for the couplings
and show how non locality affects the gap in the spectrum of charge-density
excitations. We compare our results with previous predictions obtained through
the self-consistent harmonic approximation.
