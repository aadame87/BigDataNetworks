  In this paper we show that in field theories with topologically stable kinks
and flat directions in their potential, a so-called dynamical vacuum selection
(DVS) takes place in the non-trivial, soliton sector of the theory. We explore
this DVS mechanism using a specific model. For this model we show that there is
only a static kink solution when very specific boundary conditions are met,
very similar to the case of vortices in two dimensions. In the case of other
boundary conditions a scalar cloud is expelled to infinity, leaving a static
kink behind. Other circumstances under which DVS may or may not take place are
discussed as well.
