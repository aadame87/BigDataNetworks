  We propose a scalar background in Minkowski spacetime imparting constant
proper acceleration to a classical particle. In contrast to the case of a
constant electric field the proposed scalar potential does not create
particle-antiparticle pairs. Therefore an elementary particle accelerated by
such field is a more appropriate candidate for an "Unruh-detector" than a
particle moving in a constant electric field. We show that the proposed
detector does not reveal the universal thermal response of the Unruh type.
