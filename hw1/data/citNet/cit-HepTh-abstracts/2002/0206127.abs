Title: Stability of Monopole Condensation in SU(2) QCD

  We resolve the controversy regarding the stability of the magnetic
condensation in the one-loop effective action of SU(2) QCD by calculating the
imaginary part of the effective action with two different methods
perturbatively to the order $g^2$. Our result confirms that the magnetic
condensation is indeed stable, but the electric condensation creates the
pair-annihilation of gluons. The result endorses the magnetic confinement of
color through the monopole condensation in QCD.
