  We consider the Dirac equation in the magnetic-solenoid field (the field of a
solenoid and a collinear uniform magnetic field). For the case of Aharonov-Bohm
solenoid, we construct self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian using
von Neumann's theory of deficiency indices. We find self-adjoint extensions of
the Dirac Hamiltonian in both above dimensions and boundary conditions at the
AB solenoid. Besides, for the first time, solutions of the Dirac equation in
the magnetic-solenoid field with a finite radius solenoid were found. We study
the structure of these solutions and their dependence on the behavior of the
magnetic field inside the solenoid. Then we exploit the latter solutions to
specify boundary conditions for the magnetic-solenoid field with Aharonov-Bohm
solenoid.
