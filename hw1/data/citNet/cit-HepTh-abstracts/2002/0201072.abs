  We discuss some aspects of heterotic-Type I duality. We focus on toroidal
compactification, with special attention for the topology of the gauge group,
and the topology of the bundle. We review the arguments leading to a
classification of Spin(32)/Z_2-bundles over tori, suitable for string
compactifications. A central role is played by n-gerbes with connection, a
generalization of bundles with connection.
