  We consider astrophysics of large black holes localized on the brane in the
infinite Randall-Sundrum model. Using their description in terms of a conformal
field theory (CFT) coupled to gravity, deduced in Ref. [1], we show that they
undergo a period of rapid decay via Hawking radiation of CFT modes. For
example, a black hole of mass ${\rm few} \times M_\odot$ would shed most of its
mass in $\sim 10^4 - 10^5$ years if the AdS radius is $L \sim 10^{-1}$ mm,
currently the upper bound from table-top experiments. Since this is within the
mass range of X-ray binary systems containing a black hole, the evaporation
enhanced by the hidden sector CFT modes could cause the disappearance of X-ray
sources on the sky. This would be a striking signature of RS2 with a large AdS
radius. Alternatively, for shorter AdS radii, the evaporation would be slower.
In such cases, the persistence of X-ray binaries with black holes already
implies an upper bound on the AdS radius of $L \la 10^{-2}$ mm, an order of
magnitude better than the bounds from table-top experiments. The observation of
primordial black holes with a mass in the MACHO range $M \sim 0.1 - 0.5
M_\odot$ and an age comparable to the age of the universe would further
strengthen the bound on the AdS radius to $L \la {\rm few} \times 10^{-6} $ mm.
