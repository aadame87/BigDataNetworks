  A new systematic method is developed to study to what extent the symmetry
requirements alone, above all the invariance under 16 supersymmetries (SUSY),
determine the completely off-shell effective action $\Gamma$ of a D-particle,
i.e. without imposing any restrictions on its position $r^m(\tau)$ and spin
$\theta_\alpha(\tau)$. Our method consists of (i) writing down the proper
closure relations for general SUSY transformations $\delta_\epsilon$ (which
necessarily involves $\Gamma$ itself) together with the invariance condition
$\delta_\epsilon\Gamma=0$ (ii) and solving this coupled system of functional
differential equations for $\delta_\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ simultaneously,
modulo field redefinitions, in a consistent derivative expansion scheme. Our
analysis is facilitated by a novel classification scheme introduced for the
terms in $\Gamma$. At order 2 and 4, although no assumption is made on the
underlying theory, we reproduce the effective action previously obtained at the
tree and the 1-loop level in Matrix theory respectively (modulo two constants),
together with the quantum-corrected SUSY transformations which close properly.
This constitutes a complete unambiguous proof of off-shell non-renormalization
theorems.
