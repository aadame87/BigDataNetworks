  It has been proposed that the successful inflationary description of density
perturbations on cosmological scales is sensitive to the details of physics at
extremely high (trans-Planckian) energies. We test this proposal by examining
how inflationary predictions depend on higher-energy scales within a simple
model where the higher-energy physics is well understood. We find the best of
all possible worlds: inflationary predictions are robust against the vast
majority of high-energy effects, but can be sensitive to some effects in
certain circumstances, in a way which does not violate ordinary notions of
decoupling. This implies both that the comparison of inflationary predictions
with CMB data is meaningful, and that it is also worth searching for small
deviations from the standard results in the hopes of learning about very high
energies.
