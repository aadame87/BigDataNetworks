  We construct IIA GS superstring action on the ten-dimensional pp-wave
background, which arises as the compactification of eleven-dimensional pp-wave
geometry along the isometry direction. The background geometry has 24 Killing
spinors and among them, 16 components correspond to the non-linearly realized
kinematical supersymmetry in the string action. The remaining eight components
are linearly realized and shown to be independent of x^+ coordinate, which is
identified with the world-sheet time coordinate of the string action in the
light-cone gauge. The resultant dynamical N=(4,4) supersymmetry is
investigated, which is shown to be consistent with the field contents of the
action containing two free massive supermultiplets.
