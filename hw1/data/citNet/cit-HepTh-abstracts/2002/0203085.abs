  Two different kinds of interactions between a ${Z}_{n}$-parafermionic and a
Liouville field theory are considered. For generic values of $n$, the effective
central charges describing the UV behavior of both models are calculated in the
Neveu-Schwarz sector. For $n=2$ exact vacuum expectation values of primary
fields of the Liouville field theory, as well as the first descendent fields
are proposed. For $n=1$, known results for Sinh-Gordon and Bullough-Dodd models
are recovered whereas for $n=2$, exact results for these two integrable coupled
Ising-Liouville models are shown to exchange under a weak-strong coupling
duality relation. In particular, exact relations between the parameters in the
actions and the mass of the particles are obtained. At specific imaginary
values of the coupling and $n=2$, we use previous results to obtain exact
information about: (a) Integrable coupled models like Ising-${\cal M}_{p/p'}$,
homogeneous sine-Gordon model $SU(3)_2$ or the Ising-XY model; (b)
Neveu-Schwarz sector of the $\Phi_{13}$ integrable perturbation of N=1
supersymmetric minimal models. Several non-perturbative checks are done, which
support the exact results.
