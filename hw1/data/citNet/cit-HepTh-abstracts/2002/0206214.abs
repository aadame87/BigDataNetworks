  A connection between weak and strong tension limits and their perturbative
corrections is discussed. New twistor-like models based on D=4, N=1 tensionless
superstring and superbrane with tensor central charges are studied. The
presence of three, two or less preserved fractions of $\kappa-$symmetry in the
actions free of the Wess-Zumino terms is shown. A correlation of extra
$\kappa-$symmetry with the R-symmetry is established. The equations of the
superstring and superbrane models preserving 3/4 supersymmetry are exactly
solved. The general solution for the Goldstone fermion is pure static, but for
the Goldstone bosons it also includes a term describing string/brane motions
along the fixed directions given by the initial data. These solutions
correspond to the partial spontaneous breaking of the D=4, N=1 global
supersymmetry and can be associated with a static closed magnetic
Nielsen-Olesen vortex or a p-dimensional vortex.
