  There has been substantial interest in obtaining a quantum-gravitational
description of de Sitter space. However, any such attempts have encountered
formidable obstacles, and new philosophical directions may be in order. One
possibility, although somewhat speculative, would be to view the physical
universe as a timelike hypersurface evolving in a higher-dimensional bulk
spacetime; that is, the renowned brane-world scenario. In this paper, we extend
some recent studies along this line, and consider a non-critical 3-brane moving
in the background of an anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole.
Interestingly, even an arbitrarily small electrostatic charge in the bulk can
induce a singularity-free ``bounce'' universe on the brane, whereas a vanishing
charge typically implies a singular cosmology. However, under closer
examination, from a holographic (dS/CFT) perspective, we demonstrate that the
charge-induced bounce cosmologies are not physically viable. This implies the
necessity for censoring against charge in a bulk black hole.
