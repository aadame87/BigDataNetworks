  We apply the spacetime dependent lagrangian formalism [1] to the action in
general relativity. We obtain Barriola-Vilenkin [B-V] [2] type of topological
solution by exploiting the electro-gravity duality [4] of the vacuum Einstein
equations and using Dadhich's definition of empty space. The monopole mass M is
shown to be of order a/G with a/G < M < 2a/G, a a small positive constant and G
Newton's gravitational constant. The lower of these bounds can be written as M
>= (a/G)beta, where 1< beta(=2k) < 2, 2k is the global monopole charge. This
reminds us of the Bogomolny bound for usual monopoles. Comparing with the
Barriola-Vilenkin scenario of a spontaneously broken scalar field theory, this
can also provide an experimental check on the Grand Unification Scale
(presently 10^{16}Gev) if the B-V monopole is ever discovered. PACS:11.15.-q,
