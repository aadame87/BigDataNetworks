Authors: Corneliu Sochichiu
Comments: 45 pages, 2 figures
\\
  The role of the gauge invariance in noncommutative field theory is discussed.
A basic introduction to noncommutative geometry and noncommutative field theory
is given. Background invariant formulation of Wilson lines is proposed. Duality
symmetries relating various noncommutative gauge models are being discussed.
