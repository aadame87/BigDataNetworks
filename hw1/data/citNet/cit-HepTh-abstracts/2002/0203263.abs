Title: Quantum theory of elementary processes
Authors: Andrei A. Galiautdinov (School of Physics, Georgia Institute of
  Technology)
Comments: Ph.D. Thesis, 72 pages; significant changes. Added: many-cell horizon
  limit for QFT. It is shown that the breakdown of QFT and the Standard Model
  must be expected at about 1000 GeV, many orders of magnitude smaller than the
  Plank limit (10^19 GeV). See Appendix D for details. The origin of the
  fermion mass spectrum is also proposed. See the end of Chapter II. Key words:
  elementary processes, quantum-field-space-time unification, operational
  formulation of quantum mechanics, fermion mass spectrum, localization limit

  In modern physics, one of the greatest divides is that between space-time and
quantum fields, as the fiber bundle of the Standard Model indicates. However on
the operational grounds the fields and space-time are not very different. To
describe a field in an experimental region we have to assign coordinates to the
points of that region in order to speak of "when" and "where" of the field
itself. But to operationally study the topology and to coordinatize the region
of space-time, the use of radars (to send and receive electromagnetic signals)
is required. Thus the description of fields (or, rather, processes) and the
description of space-time are indistinguishable at the fundamental level.
Moreover, classical general relativity already says -- albeit preserving the
fiber bundle structure -- that space-time and matter are intimately related.
All this indicates that a new theory of elementary processes (out of which all
the usual processes of creation, annihilation and propagation, and consequently
the topology of space-time itself would be constructed) has to be devised.
  In this thesis I present the foundations of such a finite, discrete,
algebraic, quantum theory and apply it to the description of spin-1/2 quanta of
the Standard Model.
