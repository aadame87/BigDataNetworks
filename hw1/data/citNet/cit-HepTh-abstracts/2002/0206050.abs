  In an attempt to bridge the gap between M-theory and braneworld
phenomenology, we present various gravitational Lorentz-violating braneworlds
which arise from p-brane systems. Lorentz invariance is still preserved locally
on the braneworld. For certain p-brane intersections, the massless graviton is
quasi-localized. This also results from an M5-brane in a C-field. In the case
of a p-brane perturbed from extremality, the quasi-localized graviton is
massive. For a braneworld arising from global AdS_5, gravitons travel faster
when further in the bulk, thereby apparently traversing distances faster than
light.
