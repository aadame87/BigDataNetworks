Title: Inflation, holography, and the choice of vacuum in de Sitter space
Authors: Ulf H. Danielsson
Comments: 16 pages. v2: references added and improved discussion about
  consistency of vacua

\\
  A family of de Sitter vacua introduced in hep-th/0203198 as plausible initial
conditions for inflation, are discussed from the point of view of de Sitter
holography. The vacua are argued to be physically acceptable and the
inflationary picture provides a physical interpretation of a subfamily of de
Sitter invariant vacua. Some speculations on the issue of vacuum choice and the
connection between the CMBR and holography are also provided.
