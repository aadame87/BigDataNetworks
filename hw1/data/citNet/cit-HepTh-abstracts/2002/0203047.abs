  We construct some classes of instanton solutions of eight dimensional
noncommutative ADHM equations generalizing the solutions of eight dimensional
commutative ADHM equations found by Papadopoulos and Teschendorff, and
interpret them as supersymmetric $D0$-$D8$ bound states in a NS $B$-field.
Especially, we consider the $D0$-$D8$ system with anti-self-dual $B$-field
preserving 3/16 of supercharges. This system and self-duality conditions are
related with the group $Sp(2)$ which is a subgroup of the eight dimensional
rotation group SO(8).
