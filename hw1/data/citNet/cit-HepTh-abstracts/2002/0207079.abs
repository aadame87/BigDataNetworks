Title: Boundary reduction formula
Authors: Z. Bajnok, G. Bohm and G. Takacs
Comments: 12 pages, Latex2e file with 5 eps figures, two Appendices about the
  boundary Feynman rules and the structure of the two point functions are added
\\
  An asymptotic theory is developed for general non-integrable boundary quantum
field theory in 1+1 dimensions based on the Langrangean description. Reflection
matrices are defined to connect asymptotic states and are shown to be related
to the Green functions via the boundary reduction formula derived. The
definition of the $R$-matrix for integrable theories due to Ghoshal and
Zamolodchikov and the one used in the perturbative approaches are shown to be
related.
