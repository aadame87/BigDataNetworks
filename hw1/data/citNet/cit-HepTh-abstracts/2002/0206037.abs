  We investigate the group contraction method for various space-time groups,
including SO(3)->E_2, SO(3,1)->G_3, SO(5-h,h)->P(3,1) (h=1 or 2), and its
consequences for representations of these groups. Following strictly quantum
mechanical procedures we specifically pay attention in the asymptotic limiting
procedure employed in the contraction G -> G', not only to the respective
algebras but to their representations spaces spanned by the eigenvectors of the
Cartan subalgebra and the eigenvalues labelling these representation spaces.
Where appropriate a physical interpretation is given to the contraction
prodecure.
