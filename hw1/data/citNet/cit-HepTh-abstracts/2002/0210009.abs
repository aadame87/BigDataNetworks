Title: ERG as a tool for non-perturbative studies
Authors: Yuri A. Kubyshin
Comments: 13 pages, LaTeX, based on the talk given at the International
  Conference "Renormalization Group-2002" (Tatranska Strba, Slovakia, March
  10-16, 2002)
\\
  Basic elements of the exact renormalization group method and recent results
within this approach are reviewed. Topics covered are the derivation of
equations for the effective action and relations between them, derivative
expansion, solutions of fixed point equations and the calculation of the
critical exponents, construction of the c-function and a description of the
chiral phase transition.
