  We calculate a general spectral correlation function of products and ratios
of characteristic polynomials for a $N\times N$ random matrix taken from the
chiral Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (chGUE). Our derivation is based upon finding
an Itzykson-Zuber type integral for matrices from the non-compact manifold
${\sf{Gl(n,{\mathcal{C}})/U(1)\times ...\times U(1)}}$ (matrix Macdonald
function). The correlation function is shown to be always represented in a
determinant form generalising the known expressions for only positive moments.
Finally, we present the asymptotic formula for the correlation function in the
large matrix size limit.
