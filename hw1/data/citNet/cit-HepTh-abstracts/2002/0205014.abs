  The dependence of the free energy of string theory on the temperature at T
much larger than the Hagedorn temperature was found long ago by Atick and
Witten and is $F(T)\sim \Lambda T^2$, where $\Lambda$ diverges because of a
tachyonic instability. We show that this result can be understood assuming
that, above the Hagedorn transition, Poincare' symmetry is deformed into a
quantum algebra. Physically this quantum algebra describes a non-commutative
spatial geometry and a discrete euclidean time. We then show that in string
theory this deformed Poincare' symmetry indeed emerges above the Hagedorn
temperature from the condensation of vortices on the world-sheet. This result
indicates that the endpoint of the condensation of closed string tachyons with
non-zero winding is an infinite stack of spacelike branes with a given
non-commutative world-volume geometry. On a more technical side, we also point
out that $T$-duality along a circle with antiperiodic boundary conditions for
spacetime fermions is broken by world-sheet vortices, and the would-be T-dual
variable becomes non-compact.
