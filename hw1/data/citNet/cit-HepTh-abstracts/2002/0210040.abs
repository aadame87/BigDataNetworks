Title: Bilocal Dynamics in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Ciprian Acatrinei
Comments: 6 pages; to appear in the Proceedings of the first Romanian
  Conference on Theoretical Physics, September 13-16, Bucharest, Romania
\\
  An essential aspect of noncommutative field theories is their bilocal nature.
This feature, and its role in the IR/UV mixing, are discussed using a canonical
quantization procedure developed recently.
