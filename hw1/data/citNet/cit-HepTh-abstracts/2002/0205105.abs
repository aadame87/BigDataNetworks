  It is currently believed that the local causality of Quantum Field Theory
(QFT) is destroyed by the measurement process. This belief is also based on the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox and on the so-called Bell's theorem, that
are thought to prove the existence of a mysterious, instantaneous action
between distant measurements. However, I have shown recently that the EPR
argument is removed, in an interpretation-independent way, by taking into
account the fact that the Standard Model of Particle Physics prevents the
production of entangled states with a definite number of particles. This result
is used here to argue in favor of a statistical interpretation of QFT and to
show that it allows for a full reconciliation with locality and causality.
Within such an interpretation, as Ballentine and Jarret pointed out long ago,
Bell's theorem does not demonstrate any nonlocality.
