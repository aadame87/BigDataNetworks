  Using holographic renormalization, we study correlation functions throughout
a renormalization group flow between two-dimensional superconformal field
theories. The ultraviolet theory is an N=(4,4) CFT which can be thought of as a
symmetric product of U(2) super WZW models. It is perturbed by a relevant
operator which preserves one-quarter supersymmetry and drives the theory to an
infrared fixed point. We compute correlators of the stress-energy tensor and of
the relevant operators dual to supergravity scalars. Using the former, we put
together Zamolodchikov's C function, and contrast it with proposals for a
holographic C function. In passing, we address and resolve two puzzles also
found in the case of five-dimensional bulk supergravity.
