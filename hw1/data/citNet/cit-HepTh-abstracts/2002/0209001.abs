Title: Quantum Theory over a Galois Field and Spin-statistics theorem
Authors: Felix Lev
Comments: 36 pages, Latex, no figures. A section with the following result is
  added: in quantum theory based on a Galois field, the vaccuum condition is
  consistent only for particles with the half-integer spin (in usual units)
\\
  In our previous papers it has been shown that quantum theory based on a
Galois field (GFQT) possesses a new symmetry between particles and
antiparticles, and for massless particles this symmetry (called the AB one) is
compatible with all representation operators of the symmetry algebra. In the
present paper, it is shown that the AB symmetry is compatible with all
representation operators of the symmetry algebra in the general case. As a
consequence of simple arithmetical considerations, this symmetry is compatible
with the vacuum condition, only for particles with half-integer spin (in usual
units). If the AB symmetry is combined with the spin-statistics theorem, one
arrives at the following conclusions: in quantum theory based on a Galois field
i) any neutral particle can be only composite but not elementary (this property
has been proved for the massless case in hep-th/0207192); ii) any interaction
can involve only an even number of creation/annihilation operators.
