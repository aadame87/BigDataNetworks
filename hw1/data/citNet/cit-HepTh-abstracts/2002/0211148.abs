  We present a strong method to generate various equations which have the Lax
representations on noncommutative (1+1) and (2+1)-dimensional spaces. The
generated equations contain noncommutative integrable equations obtained by
using the bicomplex method and by reductions of the noncommutative
(anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills equation. This suggests that noncommutative Lax
equations would be integrable and be derived from reductions of the
noncommutative (anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills equations, which implies the
noncommutative version of Richard Ward conjecture.
