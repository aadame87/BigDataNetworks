  New Developments in String Gravity and String Cosmology are reported:
1-String driven cosmology and its Predictions. 2-The primordial gravitational
wave background in string cosmology. 3-Non-singular string cosmologies from
Exact Conformal Field Theories. 4-Quantum Field Theory, String Temperature and
the String Phase of de Sitter space-time, 5-Hawking Radiation in String Theory
and the String Phase of Black Holes. 6-New Dual Relation between Quantum Field
Theory regimes and String regimes in Curved Backgrounds, and the 'QFT/String
Tango'. 7- New Coherent String States and Minimal Uncertainty Principle in WZWN
models
