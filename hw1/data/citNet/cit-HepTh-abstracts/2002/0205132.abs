  The minimal bosonic higher spin gauge theory in four dimensions contains
massless particles of spin s=0,2,4,.. that arise in the symmetric product of
two spin 0 singletons. It is based on an infinite dimensional extension of the
AdS_4 algebra a la Vasiliev. We derive an expansion scheme in which the
gravitational gauge fields are treated exactly and the gravitational curvatures
and the higher spin gauge fields as weak perturbations. We also give the
details of an explicit iteration procedure for obtaining the field equations to
arbitrary order in curvatures. In particular, we highlight the structure of all
the quadratic terms in the field equations.
