  Following the construction of the projection operators on $ T^2 $ presented
by Gopakumar, Headrick and Spradin, we construct the projection operators on
the integral noncommutative orbifold $ T^2/G (G=Z_k,k=2, 3, 4, 6)$. Such
operators are expressed by a function on this orbifold. So it provides a
complete set of projection operators upon the moduli space $T^2 \times K/Z_k$.
All these operators has the same trace 1/A ($A$ is an integer). Since the
projection operators correspond to solitons in noncommutative string field
theory, we obtained the explicit expression of all the soliton solutions on $
T^2/Z_k $.
