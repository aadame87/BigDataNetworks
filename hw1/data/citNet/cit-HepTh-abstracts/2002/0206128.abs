  We address the relation among the parameters of accelerating brane-universe
embedded in five dimensional bulk space. It is pointed out that the tiny
cosmological constant of our world can be obtained as quantum corrections
around a given brane-solution in the bulk theory or in the field theory on the
boundary from the holographic viewpoint.Some implications to the cosmology and
constarints on the parameters are also given.
