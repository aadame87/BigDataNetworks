  The pseudo-complex Poincare group encodes both a universal speed and a
maximal acceleration, which can be viewed as the kinematics of Born-Infeld
electrodynamics. The irreducible representations of this group are constructed,
providing the particle spectrum of a relativistic quantum theory that also
respects a maximal acceleration. One finds that each standard relativistic
particle is associated with a 'pseudo'-partner of equal spin but generically
different mass. These pseudo-partners act as Pauli-Villars regulators for the
other member of the doublet, as is found from the explicit construction of
quantum field theory on pseudo-complex spacetime. Conversely, a Pauli-Villars
regularised quantum field theory on real spacetime possesses a field phase
space with integrable pseudo-complex structure, which gives rise to a quantum
field theory on pseudo-complex spacetime.
  This equivalence between (i) maximal acceleration kinematics, (ii)
pseudo-complex quantum field theory, and (iii) Pauli-Villars regularisation
rigorously establishes a conjecture on the regularising property of the maximal
acceleration principle in quantum field theory, by Nesterenko, Feoli, Lambiase
and Scarpetta [Phys. Rev. D60, 065001].
