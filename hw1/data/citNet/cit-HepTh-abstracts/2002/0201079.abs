  Various studies have explored the possibility of explaining the
Bekenstein-Hawking (black hole) entropy by way of some suitable state-counting
procedure. Notably, many of these treatments have used the well-known Cardy
formula as an intermediate step. Our current interest is a recent calculation
in which Carlip has deduced the leading-order quantum correction to the
(otherwise) classical Cardy formula. In this paper, we apply Carlip's
formulation to the case of a generic model of two-dimensional gravity with
coupling to a dilaton field. We find that the corrected Cardy entropy includes
the anticipated logarithmic ``area'' term. Such a term is also evident when the
entropic correction is derived independently by thermodynamic means. However,
there is an apparent discrepancy between the two calculations with regard to
the factor in front of the logarithm. In fact, the two values of this prefactor
can only agree for very specific two-dimensional models, such as that
describing Jackiw-Teitelboim theory.
