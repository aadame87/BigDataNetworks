  In spacetime dimensions larger than 2, whenever a global symmetry G is
spontaneously broken to a subgroup H, and G and H are Lie groups, there are
Nambu-Goldstone modes described by fields with values in G/H. In
two-dimensional spacetimes as well, models where fields take values in G/H are
of considerable interest even though in that case there is no spontaneous
breaking of continuous symmetries. We consider such models when the world sheet
is a two-sphere and describe their fuzzy analogues for G=SU(N+1),
H=S(U(N-1)xU(1)) ~ U(N) and G/H=CP^N. More generally our methods give fuzzy
versions of continuum models on S^2 when the target spaces are Grassmannians
and flag manifolds described by (N+1)x(N+1) projectors of rank =< (N+1)/2.
These fuzzy models are finite-dimensional matrix models which nevertheless
retain all the essential continuum topological features like solitonic sectors.
They seem well-suited for numerical work.
