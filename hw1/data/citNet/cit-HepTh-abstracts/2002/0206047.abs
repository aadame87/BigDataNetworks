  The bare one loop soliton quantum mass corrections can be expressed in two
ways: as a sum over the zero-point energies of small oscillations around the
classical configuration, or equivalently as the (Euclidean) effective action
per unit time. In order to regularize the bare one loop quantum corrections
(expressed as the sum over the zero-point energies) we subtract and add from it
the tadpole graph that appear in the expansion of the effective action per unit
time. The subtraction renders the one loop quantum corrections finite. Next, we
use the renormalization prescription that the added tadpole graph cancels with
adequate counterterms, obtaining in this way a finite unambiguous expression
for the one loop soliton quantum mass corrections. When we apply the method to
the solitons of the sine-Gordon and phi^4 kink models we obtain results that
agree with known results. Finally we apply the method to compute the soliton
quantum mass corrections in the recently introduced phi^2 cos^2 ln(phi^2)
model.
