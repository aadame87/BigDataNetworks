  We show that the anomalous contribution to the central charge of the
1+1-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric kink that is required for BPS saturation at
the quantum level can be linked to an analogous term in the extra momentum
operator of a 2+1-dimensional kink domain wall with spontaneous parity
violation and chiral domain wall fermions. In the quantization of the domain
wall, BPS saturation is preserved by nonvanishing quantum corrections to the
momentum density in the extra space dimension. Dimensional reduction from 2+1
to 1+1 dimensions preserves the unbroken N=1/2 supersymmetry and turns these
parity-violating contributions into the anomaly of the central charge of the
supersymmetric kink. On the other hand, standard dimensional regularization by
dimensional reduction from 1 to (1-epsilon) spatial dimensions, which also
preserves supersymmetry, obtains the anomaly from an evanescent counterterm.
