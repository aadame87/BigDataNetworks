  Black Hole

  We review a recent proposal towards a microscopic understanding of the
entropy of non-supersymmetric spacetimes -- with emphasis on the Schwarzschild
black hole. The approach is based at an intermediate step on the description of
the non-supersymmetric spacetime in terms of dual Euclidean brane pairs of
type-II string-theory or M-theory. By counting specific chain structures on the
brane-complex, it is shown that one can reproduce the exact Schwarzschild black
hole entropy plus its logarithmic correction.
