Title: Nonperturbative Aspects in N-fold Supersymmetry
Authors: Toshiaki Tanaka and Masatoshi Sato
Comments: 9 pages, Talk given at the 3rd International Sakharov Conference on
  Physics, Moscow, June 2002
\\
  Through a nonperturbative analysis on a sextic triple-well potential, we
reveal novel aspects of the dynamical property of the system in connection with
N-fold supersymmetry and quasi-solvability.
