Title: Effective Action for Self-Interacting Scalar Field in 3-dimensional Ball
Authors: M.R. Setare and Kh. Saaidi

  In this paper we have considered the renormalized one-loop effective action
for massless self-interacting scalar field in the 3-dimensional ball. The
scalar field satisfies Dirichlet boundary condition on the ball. Using heat
kernel expansion method we calculate the divergent part of effective action,
then by bag model renormalization procedure we obtain the renormalized one-loop
effective action.
