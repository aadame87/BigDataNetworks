  We construct representation of the Separated Variables (SoV) for the quantum
SL(2,R) Heisenberg closed spin chain and obtain the integral representation for
the eigenfunctions of the model. We calculate explicitly the Sklyanin measure
defining the scalar product in the SoV representation and demonstrate that the
language of Feynman diagrams is extremely useful in establishing various
properties of the model. The kernel of the unitary transformation to the SoV
representation is described by the same "pyramid diagram" as appeared before in
the SoV representation for the SL(2,C) spin magnet. We argue that this kernel
is given by the product of the Baxter Q-operators projected onto a special
reference state.
