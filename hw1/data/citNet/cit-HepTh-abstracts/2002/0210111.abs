  We discuss the nonlinear transformations of standard Poincar\'{e} symmetry in
the context of recently introduced Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) theories. We
introduce four classes of modified relativistic theories with three of them
describing various DSR frameworks. We consider four examples of modified
relativistic symmetries, which illustrate each of the considered class.
