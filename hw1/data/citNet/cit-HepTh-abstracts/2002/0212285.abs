  We start from a parity-breaking MCS QED$_{3}$ model with spontaneous breaking
of the gauge symmetry as a framework for evaluation of the electron-electron
interaction potential and for attainment of numerical values for the e-e bound
state. Three expressions are obtained for the potential according to the
polarization state of the scattered electrons. In an energy scale compatible
with Condensed Matter electronic excitations, these three potentials become
degenerated. The resulting potential is implemented in the Schrodinger equation
and the variational method is applied to carry out the electronic binding
energy. The resulting binding energies in the scale of 10-100 meV and a
correlation length in the scale of 10-30 Angs. are possible indications that
the MCS-QED$_{3}$ model adopted may be suitable to address an eventual case of
e-e pairing in the presence of parity-symmetry breakdown. The data analyzed
here suggest an energy scale of 10-100 meV to fix the breaking of the
U(1)-symmetry.
