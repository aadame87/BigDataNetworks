  We analyze the link between the occurrence of massless B-type D-branes for
specific values of moduli and monodromy around such points in the moduli space.
This allows us to propose a classification of all massless B-type D-branes at
any point in the moduli space of Calabi-Yau's. This classification then
justifies a previous conjecture due to Horja for the general form of monodromy.
Our analysis is based on using monodromies around points in moduli space where
a single D-brane becomes massless to generate monodromies around points where
an infinite number become massless. We discuss the various possibilities within
the classification.
