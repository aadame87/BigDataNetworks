  We study the black hole shape using the C-metric solution for a matter
trapped near the IR-brane in the ${AdS}_4$ space. In the AdS/CFT duality, the
IR-brane is introduced by embedding a 2-brane at the ${AdS}_4$ radius $z=l$,
while the UV-brane is defined by the ${AdS}_4$ boundary. We find the C-metric
solution generates a negative tension IR-brane and a negative thermal energy
gas of colliding particles. We analyze the momentum energy tensor at the
${AdS}_4$ boundary. We find that the negative energy black hole solution is
entirely unstable even for a small perturbation in the Poincare coordinate
space. However, such a black hole decays very rapidly due to the imaginary part
emerges in the ADM mass. This imaginary part appears because of the orbifold
constraints of the C-metric solution in the unusual coordinates. Moreover, this
decay rate diverges at the UV-brane. This implies that the black hole
evaporates instantaneously otherwise the boundary itself will collapse.
