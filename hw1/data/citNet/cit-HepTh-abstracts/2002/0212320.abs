  When phase space coordinates are noncommutative, especially including
arbitrarily noncommutative momenta, the Hall effect is reinvestigated. A
minimally gauge-invariant coupling of electromagnetic field is introduced by
making use of Faddeev-Jackiw formulation for unconstrained and constrained
systems. We find that the parameter of noncommutative momenta makes an
important contribution to the Hall conductivity.
