  We construct the Hamiltonian of the super five brane in terms of its physical
degrees of freedom. It does not depend on the inverse of the induced metric.
Consequently, some singular configurations are physically admissible, implying
an interpretation of the theory as a multiparticle one. The symmetries of the
theory are analyzed from the canonical point of view in terms of the first and
second class constraints. In particular it is shown how the chiral sector may
be canonically reduced to its physical degrees of freedom.
