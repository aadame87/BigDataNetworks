  As a concrete application of the holographic correspondence to manifolds
which are only asymptotically Anti-de Sitter, we take a closer look at the
quaternionic Taub-NUT space. This is a four dimensional, non-compact,
inhomogeneous, riemannian manifold with the interesting property of smoothly
interpolating between two symmetric spaces, AdS_4 itself and the coset
SU(2,1)/U(2). Even more interesting is the fact that the scalar curvature of
the induced conformal structure at the boundary (corresponding to a squashed
three-sphere) changes sign as we interpolate between these two limiting cases.
Using twistor methods, we construct the bulk-to-bulk and bulk-to-boundary
propagators for conformally coupled scalars on quaternionic Taub-NUT. This may
eventually enable us to calculate correlation functions in the dual strongly
coupled CFT on a squashed S^3 using the standard AdS/CFT prescription.
