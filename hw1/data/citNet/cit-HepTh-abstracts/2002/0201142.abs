  We establish that the Yang-Baxter equations in the presence of an impurity
can in general only admit solutions of simultaneous tranmission and reflection
when the transmission and reflection amplitudes commute in the defect degrees
of freedom with an additional exchange of the corresponding rapidities. In the
absence of defect degrees of freedom we show in complete generality, that the
only exceptions to this are theories which possess rapidity independent bulk
scattering matrices. In particular bulk theories with diagonal scattering
matrices, can only be the free Boson and Fermion, the Federbush model and their
generalizations. These anyonic solutions do not admit the possibility of
excited impurity states.
