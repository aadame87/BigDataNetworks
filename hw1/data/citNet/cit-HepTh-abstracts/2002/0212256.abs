  It is shown in detail that the dynamics of the Einstein-dilaton-p-form system
in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity can be asymptotically described, at
a generic spatial point, as a billiard motion in a region of Lobachevskii space
(realized as an hyperboloid in the space of logarithmic scale factors). This is
done within the Hamiltonian formalism, and for an arbitrary number of spacetime
dimensions $D \geq 4$. A key role in the derivation is played by the Iwasawa
decomposition of the spatial metric, and by the fact that the off-diagonal
degrees of freedom, as well as the p-form degrees of freedom, get
``asymptotically frozen'' in this description. For those models admitting a
Kac-Moody theoretic interpretation of the billiard dynamics we outline how to
set up an asymptotically equivalent description in terms of a one-dimensional
non-linear sigma-model formally invariant under the corresponding Kac-Moody
group.
