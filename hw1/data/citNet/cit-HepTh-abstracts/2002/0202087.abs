  We establish that the open string star product in the zero momentum sector
can be described as a continuous tensor product of mutually commuting two
dimensional Moyal star products. Let the continuous variable $\kappa \in
[~0,\infty)$ parametrize the eigenvalues of the Neumann matrices; then the
noncommutativity parameter is given by $\theta(\kappa) =2\tanh(\pi\kappa/4)$.
For each $\kappa$, the Moyal coordinates are a linear combination of even
position modes, and the Fourier transform of a linear combination of odd
position modes. The commuting coordinate at $\kappa=0$ is identified as the
momentum carried by half the string. We discuss the relation to Bars' work, and
attempt to write the string field action as a noncommutative field theory.
