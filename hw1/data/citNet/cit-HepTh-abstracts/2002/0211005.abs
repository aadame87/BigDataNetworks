  The survey summarizes briefly the results obtained recently in the Casimir
effect studies considering the following subjects: i) account of the material
characteristics of the media and their influence on the vacuum energy (for
example, dilute dielectric ball); ii) application of the spectral geometry
methods for investigating the vacuum energy of quantized fields with the goal
to gain some insight, specifically, in the geometrical origin of the
divergences that enter the vacuum energy and to develop the relevant
renormalization procedure; iii) universal method for calculating the high
temperature dependence of the Casimir energy in terms of heat kernel
coefficients.
