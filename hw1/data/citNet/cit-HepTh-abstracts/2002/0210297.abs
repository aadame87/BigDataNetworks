  The Dirac operator for a manifold $Q$, and its chirality operator when $Q$ is
even dimensional, have a central role in noncommutative geometry. We
systematically develop the theory of this operator when $Q=G/H$, where $G$ and
$H$ are compact connected Lie groups and $G$ is simple. An elementary
discussion of the differential geometric and bundle theoretic aspects of $G/H$,
including its projective modules and complex, K\"ahler and Riemannian
structures, is presented for this purpose. An attractive feature of our
approach is that it transparently shows obstructions to spin- and
spin$_c$-structures. When a manifold is spin$_c$ and not spin, U(1) gauge
fields have to be introduced in a particular way to define spinors. Likewise,
for manifolds like $SU(3)/SO(3)$, which are not even spin$_c$, we show that
SU(2) and higher rank gauge fields have to be introduced to define spinors.
This result has potential consequences for string theories if such manifolds
occur as $D$-branes. The spectra and eigenstates of the Dirac operator on
spheres $S^n=SO(n+1)/SO(n)$, invariant under $SO(n+1)$, are explicitly found.
Aspects of our work overlap with the earlier research of Cahen et al..
