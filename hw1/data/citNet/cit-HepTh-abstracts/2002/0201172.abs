  We show that multi-trace interactions can be consistently incorporated into
an extended AdS/CFT prescription involving the inclusion of generalized
boundary conditions and a modified Legendre transform prescription. We find new
and consistent results by considering a self-contained formulation which
relates the quantization of the bulk theory to the AdS/CFT correspondence and
the perturbation at the boundary by double-trace interactions. We show that
there exist particular double-trace perturbations for which irregular modes are
allowed to propagate as well as the regular ones. We perform a detailed
analysis of many different possible situations, for both minimally and
non-minimally coupled cases. In all situations, we make use of a new constraint
which is found by requiring consistence. In the particular non-minimally
coupled case, the natural extension of the Gibbons-Hawking surface term is
generated.
