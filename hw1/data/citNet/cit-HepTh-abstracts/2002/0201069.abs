  We review the procedure by which we implemented the non-Abelian Gauss's law
and constructed gauge-invariant fields for QCD in the temporal (Weyl) gauge. We
point out that the operator-valued transformation that transforms
gauge-dependent temporal-gauge fields into gauge-invariant ones has the formal
structure of a gauge transformation. We express the ``standard'' Hamiltonian
for temporal-gauge QCD entirely in terms of gauge-invariant fields, calculate
the commutation rules for these fields, and compare them to earlier work on
Coulomb-gauge QCD. We also discuss multiplicities of gauge-invariant
temporal-gauge fields that belong to different topological sectors and that, in
previous work, were shown to be based on the same underlying gauge-dependent
temporal-gauge fields. We relate these multiplicities of gauge-invariant fields
to Gribov copies. We argue that Gribov copies appear in the temporal gauge, but
not when the theory is represented in terms of gauge-dependent fields and
Gauss's law is left unimplemented. There are Gribov copies of the
gauge-invariant gauge field, which can be constructed when Gauss's law is
implemented.
