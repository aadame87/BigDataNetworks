  The low energy dynamics of vortices in selfdual Abelian Higgs theory is of
second order in vortex velocity and characterized by the moduli space metric.
When Chern-Simons term with small coefficient is added to the theory, we show
that a term linear in vortex velocity appears and can be consistently added to
the second order expression. We provides an additional check of the first and
second order terms by studying the angular momentum in the field theory. We
briefly explore other first order term due to small background electric charge
density and also the harmonic potential well for vortices given by the moment
of inertia.
