Title: On 7D TFT and 6D chiral CFT
Authors: Jens Fjelstad
Comments: 10 pages, v2: we have learned that the main results appear already in
  hep-th/0108152, see added notes at end of paper
\\
  We perform a canonical and BRST analysis of a seven-dimensional Chern-Simons
theory on a manifold with boundary. The main result is that the 7D theory
induces for consistency a chiral two-form on the 6D boundary. We also comment
on similar behaviour in a five-dimensional Chern-Simons theory relevant for
$\N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.
