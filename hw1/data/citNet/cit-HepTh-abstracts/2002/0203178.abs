  Using the new scalar and vector degrees of freedom derived from the
non-linear gauge condition (grad-dot-D)(grad-dot-A)=0, we show that the
effective dynamics of the vector fields (identified as ``gluons'') in the
stochastic vacuum defined by the scalars result in the vector fields acquiring
a mass. We also find the vector fields losing their self-interactions.
