  We give the full list of types of static (homogeneous)solutions within a wide
family of exactly solvable 2D dilaton gravities with backreaction of conformal
fields. It includes previously known solutions as particular cases. Several
concrete examples are considered for illustration. They contain a black hole
and cosmological horizon in thermal equilibrium, extremal and ultraextremal
horizons, etc. In particular, we demonstrate that adS and dS geometries can be
\QTR{it}{exact} solutions of semiclassical field equations for a
\QTR{it}{nonconstant} dilaton field.
