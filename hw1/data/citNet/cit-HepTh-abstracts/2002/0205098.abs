  We investigate the rolling of the tachyon on the unstable D9 brane in Type
IIA string theory by studying the BSFT action. The action is known for linear
profiles of the tachyon, which is the expected asymptotic behavior of the
tachyon as it approaches the closed string vacuum, as recently described by
Sen. We find that the action does indeed seem consistent with the general Sen
description, in that it implies a constant energy density with diminishing
pressure. However, the details are somewhat different from an effective field
theory of Born-Infeld type. For instance, the BSFT action implies there are
poles for certain rolling velocities, while a Born-Infeld action would have a
cut. We also find that solutions with pressure diminishing from either the
positive or negative side are possible.
