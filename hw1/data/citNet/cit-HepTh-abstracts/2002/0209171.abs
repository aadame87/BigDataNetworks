Title: A Note on Strings in a Rindler Background
Authors: Sudarshan Ananth
Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX; typos corrected
Report-no: UFIFT-HEP-02-30
\\
  We study bosonic strings in a Rindler background using a D-23 brane. This
model is shown to be directly related to the orbifold approach to Rindler
strings. We propose a duality between these pictures based on comparisons of
their closed string spectra.
