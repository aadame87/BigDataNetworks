  We study the linearly-realised worldsheet supersymmetries in the ``massive''
type II light-cone actions for pp-wave backgrounds. The pp-waves have have
16+N_sup Killing spinors, comprising 16 ``standard'' Killing spinors that occur
in any wave background, plus N_sup ``supernumerary'' Killing spinors (0\le
N_sup \le 16) that occur only for special backgrounds. We show that only the
supernumerary Killing spinors give rise to linearly-realised worldsheet
supersymmetries after light-cone gauge fixing, while the 16 standard Killing
spinors describe only non-linearly realised inhomogeneous symmetries. We also
study the type II actions in the physical gauge, and we show that although in
this case the actions are not free, there are now linearly-realised
supersymmetries coming both from the standard and the supernumerary Killing
spinors. In the physical gauge, there are no mass terms for any worldsheet
degrees of freedom, so the masses appearing in the light-cone gauge may be
viewed as gauge artefacts. We obtain type IIA and IIB supergravity solutions
describing solitonic strings in pp-wave backgrounds, and show how these are
related to the physical-gauge fundamental string actions. We study the
supersymmetries of these solutions, and find examples with various numbers of
Killing spinors, including total numbers that are odd.
