  We apply zeta-function regularization to the kink and susy kink and compute
its quantum mass. We fix ambiguities by the renormalization condition that the
quantum mass vanishes as one lets the mass gap tend to infinity while keeping
scattering data fixed. As an alternative we write the regulated sum over zero
point energies in terms of the heat kernel and apply standard heat kernel
subtractions. Finally we discuss to what extent these procedures are equivalent
to the usual renormalization conditions that tadpoles vanish.
