Title: To see a world in a grain of sand
Authors: Shou-Cheng Zhang
Comments: A chapter for John Wheeler's 90's birthday festschrift

  Throughout John Wheeler's career, he wrestled with big issues like the
fundamental length, the black hole and the unification of quantum mechanics and
relativity. In this essay, I argue that solid state physics -- historically the
study of silicon, semiconductors and sand grains -- can give surprisingly deep
insights into the big questions of the world.
