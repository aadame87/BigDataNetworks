Title: On the nullification of threshold amplitudes

\\
  The nullification of threshold amplitudes is considered within the
conventional framework of quantum field theory. The relevant Ward identities
for the reduced theory are derived both on path-integral and diagrammatic
levels. They are then used to prove the vanishing of tree-graph threshold
amplitudes.
