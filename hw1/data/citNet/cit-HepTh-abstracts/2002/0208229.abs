Title: Massive Bosons and the dS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Oisin A.P. Mac Conamhna
Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX; changes to title and abstract, minor changes
  throughout the text and improved discussion of the issue of unitarity of the
  boundary theory. Final version to appear in Phys. Rev. D
\\
  We compute the boundary two point functions of operators corresponding to
massive spin 1 and spin 2 de Sitter fields, by an extension of the ``S-Matrix''
approach developed for bulk scalars. In each case the two point functions are
of the form required for conformal invariance of the dual boundary field
theory. We emphasise that in the context of dS/CFT one should consider unitary
representations of the Euclidean conformal group, without reference to analytic
continuation of the boundary theory to Lorentzian signature.
