  Recently the operator algebra and twisted vertex operator equations were
given for each sector of all WZW orbifolds, and a set of twisted KZ equations
for the WZW permutation orbifolds were worked out as a large example. In this
companion paper we report two further large examples of this development. In
the first example we solve the twisted vertex operator equations in an abelian
limit to obtain the twisted vertex operators and correlators of a large class
of abelian orbifolds. In the second example, the twisted vertex operator
equations are applied to obtain a set of twisted KZ equations for the
(outer-automorphic) charge conjugation orbifold on su(n \geq 3).
