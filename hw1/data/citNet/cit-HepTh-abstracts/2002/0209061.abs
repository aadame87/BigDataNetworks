  The quantum gravity problem of N point particles interacting with the
gravitational field in 2+1 dimensions is approached working out the phase-space
functional integral. The maximally slicing gauge is adopted for a non compact
open universe with the topology of the plane. The conjugate momenta to the
gravitational field are related to a class of meromorphic quadratic
differentials. The boundary term for the non compact space is worked out in
detail. In the extraction of the physical degrees of freedom functional
determinants related to the puncture formulation of string theory occur and
cancel out in the final reduction. Finally the ordering problem in the
definition of the functional integral is discussed.
