  We consider Penrose limits of the Klebanov-Strassler and Maldacena-Nunez
holographic duals to N =1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills. By focusing in on the IR
region we obtain exactly solvable string theory models. These represent the
nonrelativistic motion and low-lying excitations of heavy hadrons with mass
proportional to a large global charge. We argue that these hadrons, both
physically and mathematically, take the form of heavy nonrelativistic strings;
we term them "annulons." A simple toy model of a string boosted along a compact
circle allows us considerable insight into their properties. We also calculate
the Wilson loop carrying large global charge and show the effect of confinement
is quadratic, not linear, in the string tension.
