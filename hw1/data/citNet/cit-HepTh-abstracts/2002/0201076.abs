  We give a constructive classification of the positive energy (lowest weight)
unitary irreducible representations of the D=6 superconformal algebras
osp(8*/2N). Our results confirm all but one of the conjectures of Minwalla (for
N=1,2) on this classification. Our main tool is the explicit construction of
the norms of the states that has to be checked for positivity. We give also the
reduction of the exceptional UIRs.
