  We discuss properties of a 3-brane in an asymptotic 5-dimensional de-Sitter
spacetime. It is found that a Minkowski solution can be obtained without
fine-tuning. In the model, the tiny observed positive cosmological constant is
interpreted as a curvature of 5-dimensional manifold, but the Minkowski
spacetime, where we live, is a natural 3-brane perpendicular to the fifth
coordinate axis.
