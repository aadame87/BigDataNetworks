  We construct some N=1 supersymmetric three-family SU(5) Grand Unified Models
from type IIA orientifolds on $\IT^6/(\IZ_2\times \IZ_2)$ with D6-branes
intersecting at general angles. These constructions are supersymmetric only for
special choices of untwisted moduli. We show that within the above class of
constructions there are no supersymmetric three-family models with 3 copies of
{\bf 10}-plets unless there are simultaneously some {\bf 15}-plets. We
systematically analyze the construction of such models and their spectra. The
M-theory lifts of these brane constructions become purely geometrical
backgrounds: they are singular $G_2$ manifolds where the Grand Unified gauge
symmetries and three families of chiral fermions are localized at codimension 4
and codimension 7 singularities respectively. We also study somepreliminary
phenomenological features of the models.
