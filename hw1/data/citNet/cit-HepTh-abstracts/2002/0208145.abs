  The double-tensor multiplet naturally appears in type IIB superstring
compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, and is dual to the universal
hypermultiplet. We revisit the calculation of instanton corrections to the
low-energy effective action, in the supergravity approximation. We derive a
Bogomolny'i bound for the double-tensor multiplet and find new instanton
solutions saturating the bound. They are characterized by the topological
charges and the asymptotic values of the scalar fields in the double-tensor
multiplet.
