  Modification of nonrelativistic phase space structure based on fuzzy ordered
sets (Fosets) structure investigated as a possible quantization framework. In
this model particle's $m$ state corresponds to Foset element - fuzzy point. Due
to fuzzy ordering its space coordinate $x$ acquires principal uncertainty
$\sigma_x$. It's shown that proposed Mechanics on fuzzy phase space manifold
reproduces the main quantum effects, in particular the interference of quantum
states.
