  Background

  We discuss the signature of the scale of short distance physics in the Cosmic
Microwave Background. In addition to effects which depend on the ratio of
Hubble scale H during inflation to the energy scale M of the short distance
physics, there can be effects which depend on $\dot{\phi}^2/M^4$ where $\phi$
is the {\it classical background} of the inflaton field. Therefore, the
imprints of short distance physics on the spectrum of Cosmic Microwave
Background anisotropies generically involve a {\it double expansion}. We
present some examples of a single scalar field with higher order kinetic terms
coupled to Einstein gravity, and illustrate that the effects of short distance
physics on the Cosmic Microwave Background can be substantial even for H << M,
and generically involve corrections that are not simply powers of H/M. The size
of such effects can depend on the short distance scale non-analytically even
though the action is local.
