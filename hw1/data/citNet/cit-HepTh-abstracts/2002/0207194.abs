  We research the entropy of a black hole in curved space-times by 't Hooft`s
approach, so-called the brick wall method. One of these space-time, a
asymptotically dS space-time has two physical horizons; one is a black hole
horizon and the other is a cosmological horizon. The others have only one
horizon, a black hole horizon. Using this model, we calculate all thermodynamic
quantities containing the background geometric effect and show that entropy is
proportional to area of each boundary. Furthermore, we show that the
Cardy-Verlinde formula can be rederived from the physical quantities of the
brick wall method and this fact becomes a evidence of the dS/CFT
correspondence.
