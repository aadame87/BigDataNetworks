  We study the Casimir problem as the limit of a conventional quantum field
theory coupled to a smooth background. The Casimir energy diverges in the limit
that the background forces the field to vanish on a surface. We show that this
divergence cannot be absorbed into a renormalization of the parameters of the
theory. As a result, the Casimir energy of the surface and other quantities
like the surface tension, which are obtained by deforming the surface, cannot
be defined independently of the details of the coupling between the field and
the matter on the surface. In contrast, the energy density away from the
surface and the force between rigid surfaces are finite and independent of
these complications.
