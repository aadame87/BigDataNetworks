  The Cardy-Verlinde formula is further verified by using the
Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ and Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ black holes. In the
Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ spacetime, we find that, for strongly coupled CFTs with AdS
duals, to cast the entropy of the CFT into the Cardy-Verlinde formula the
Casimir energy must contains the terms $ -n ({\mathcal{J}} \Omega_H+
\frac{Q\Phi}{2}+ \frac{Q\Phi_0}{2})$, which associate with rotational and
electric potential energies, and the extensive energy includes the term $-Q
\Phi_0$. For the Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ black hole, we note that the Casimir energy
is negative but the extensive energy is positive on the cosmological horizon;
while the Casimir energy is positive but the extensive energy is negative on
the event horizon (the definitions for the two energies possess the same forms
as the corresponding quantities of the Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ black hole). Thus we
have to take the absolute value of the Casimir (extensive) energy in the
Cardy-Verlinde formula for the cosmological (event) horizon. The result for the
Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ spacetime provides support of the dS/CFT correspondence.
Furthermore, we also obtain the Bekenstein-Verlinde-like entropy bound for the
Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ black hole and the D-bound on the entropy of matter system
in Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ spacetime. We find that both the bounds are tightened by
the electric charge.
