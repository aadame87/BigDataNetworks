  In discussions of Bousso's Covariant Entropy Bound, the Null Energy Condition
is always assumed, as a sufficient {\em but not necessary} condition which
helps to ensure that the entropy on any lightsheet shall necessarily be finite.
  The spectacular failure of the Strong Energy Condition in cosmology has,
however, led many astrophysicists and cosmologists to consider models of dark
energy which violate {\em all} of the energy conditions, and indeed the current
data do not completely rule out such models. The NEC also has a questionable
status in brane cosmology: it is probably necessary to violate the NEC in the
bulk in order to obtain a "self-tuning" theory of the cosmological constant. In
order to investigate these proposals, we modify the Karch-Randall model by
introducing NEC-violating matter into $AdS_5$ in such a way that the brane
cosmological constant relaxes to zero. The entropy on lightsheets remains
finite. However, we still find that the spacetime is fundamentally incompatible
with the Covariant Entropy Bound machinery, in the sense that it fails the
Bousso-Randall consistency condition. We argue that holography probably forbids
all {\em cosmological} violations of the NEC, and that holography is in fact
the fundamental physical principle underlying the cosmological version of the
NEC.
