  We make a number of observations about matter-ghost string phase, which may
eventually lead to a formal connection between matroid theory and string
theory. In particular, in order to take advantage of the already established
connection between matroid theory and Chern-Simons theory, we propose a
generalization of string theory in terms of some kind of Kahler metric. We show
that this generalization is closely related to the Kahler-Chern-Simons action
due to Nair and Schiff. We also add new information about the relationship
between matroid theory, D=11 supergravity and Chern-Simons formalism.
