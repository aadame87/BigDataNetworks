Title: On explicit solutions for completely integrable classical Calogero-Moser
  systems in external fields
Authors: D.V.Meshcheryakov, T.D.Meshcheryakova
\\
  Explicit solutions for one completely-integrable system of Calogero-Moser
type in external fields are found in case of three and four interacting
particles. Relation between coupling constant, initial values of coordinates
and time of falling into the singularity of potential is derived.
