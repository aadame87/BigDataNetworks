  I describe the main features of new intersecting D4- and D5-brane orbifold
models that yield the non-supersymmetric standard model, up to vector-like
matter and, in some cases, extra U(1) factors in the gauge group. There are
six-stack D4-brane models that have charged-singlet scalar tachyons and which
either contain all of the Yukawa couplings to the tachyonic Higgs doublets that
are needed to generate mass terms for the fermions at renormalisable level or
possess an unwanted extra U(1) gauge symmetry after spontaneous symmetry
breaking. In the D5-brane models a minimum of eight stacks is needed.
