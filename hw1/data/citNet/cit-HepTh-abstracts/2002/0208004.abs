Title: A unitary scenario for particle-black hole scattering?

  The process of particle capture by an extremal charged black hole followed by
Hawking radiation is believed not to preserve unitarity at one-loop level. In
this paper we point out that the above standard picture can be altered due to
backreaction effects. In the semiclassical approximation, and for the special
low-energy particle-hole scattering considered, the corrected Hawking radiation
seems compatible with unitarity.
