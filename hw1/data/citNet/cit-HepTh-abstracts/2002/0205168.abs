  We amalgamate three fields of concepts and phenomena and argue that they are
essentially the same. Connes' framework of non-commutative topological spaces
and ``points, speaking to each other'', a translocal web of correlations, being
hidden in the depth-structure of our macroscopic space-time, and the translocal
features of quantum theory. We argue in particular, that the conception of our
space-time continuum as basically an aggregate of structureless points is
almost shurely to poor and that the very conceptual structure of quantum
theory, like e.g. the complex superposition principle, is a mesoscopic
consequence of this existing web of translocal relations, which, on the other
hand, has its roots in the initial conditions of our universe.
