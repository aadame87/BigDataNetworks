  We give a non-technical outline of a program to study the (2,0) theories in
six space-time dimensions. Away from the origin of their moduli space, these
theories describe the interactions of tensor multiplets and self-dual spinning
strings. We argue that if the ratio between the square of the energy of a
process and the string tension is taken to be small, it should be possible to
study the dynamics of such a system perturbatively in this parameter. As a
first step in this direction, we perform a classical computation of the
amplitude for scattering chiral tensor and scalar fields (i.e. the bosonic part
of a tensor multiplet) against a self-dual spinnless string.
