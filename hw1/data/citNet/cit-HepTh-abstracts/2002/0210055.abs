  The relationship between the entropy of de Sitter (dS) Schwarzschild space
and that of the CFT which lives on the brane by using
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equations and Cardy-Verlinde formula is
discussed. We show that when the time-like brane crosses the black hole horizon
of dS Schwarzschild black hole, the entropy of the CFT exactly agrees with the
black hole entropy of 5-dimensional dS background.
