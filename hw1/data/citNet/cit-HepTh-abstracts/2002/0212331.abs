Title: Effective theory for close limit of two branes

  We discuss the effective theory for the close limit of two branes in a
covariant way. To do so we solve the five dimensional Einstein equation along
the direction of extra dimension. Using the Taylor expansion we formally solve
the bulk and derive the effective theory describing the close limit systems. We
will also discuss the radion dynamics and braneworld black holes for the close
limit in our formulation.
