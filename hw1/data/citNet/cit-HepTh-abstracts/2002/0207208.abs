  Using mirror pairs (M_3, W_3) in type II superstring compactifications on
Calabi-Yau threefolds, we study, geometrically, F-theory duals of M-theory on
seven manifolds with G_2 holonomy. We first develop a way for getting Landau
Ginzburg (LG) Calabi-Yau threefols W_3, embedded in four complex dimensional
toric varieties, mirror to sigma model on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds M_3. This
method gives directly the right dimension without introducing non dynamical
variables. Then, using toric geometry tools, we discuss the duality between
M-theory on (S^1 x M_3)/Z_2 with G_2 holonomy and F-theory on elliptically
fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds with SU(4) holonomy, containing W_3 mirror
manifolds. Illustrating examples are presented.
