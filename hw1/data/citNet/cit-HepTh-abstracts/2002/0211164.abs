  The consistent form of the gauge anomaly is worked out at first order in
$\theta$ for the noncommutative three-point function of the ordinary gauge
field of certain noncommutative chiral gauge theories defined by means of the
Seiberg-Witten map. We obtain that for any compact simple Lie group the anomaly
cancellation condition of this three-point function reads $\traza \T^a \T^b
\T^c = 0$, if one restricts the type of noncommutative counterterms that can be
added to the classical action to restore the gauge symmetry to those which are
renormalizable by power-counting. On the other hand, if the power-counting
remormalizability paradigm is relinquished and one admits noncommutative
counterterms (of the gauge fields, its derivatives and $\theta$) which are not
power-counting renormalizable, then, the anomaly cancellation condition for the
noncommutative three-point function of the ordinary gauge field becomes the
ordinary one: $\traza \T^a \{\T^b,\T^c\} = 0$.
