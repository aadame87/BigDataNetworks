  This work is an extension of our previous work, hep-th/0204160, which showed
how to systematically calculate the high energy evolution of gauge couplings in
compact AdS_5 backgrounds. We first directly compute the one-loop effects of
massive charged scalar fields on the low energy couplings of a gauge theory
propagating in the AdS background. It is found that scalar bulk mass scales
(which generically are of order the Planck scale) enter only logarithmically in
the corrections to the tree-level gauge couplings. As we pointed out
previously, we show that the large logarithms that appear in the AdS one-loop
calculation can be obtained within the confines of an effective field theory,
by running the Planck brane correlator from a high UV matching scale down to
the TeV scale. This result exactly reproduces our previous calculation, which
was based on AdS/CFT duality. We also calculate the effects of scalar fields
satisfying non-trivial boundary conditions (relevant for orbifold breaking of
bulk symmetries) on the running of gauge couplings.
