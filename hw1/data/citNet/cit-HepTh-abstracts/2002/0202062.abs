  An electron moving on plane in a uniform magnetic field orthogonal to plane
is known as the Landau problem. Wigner functions for the Landau problem when
the plane is noncommutative are found employing solutions of the Schroedinger
equation as well as solving the ordinary *-genvalue equation in terms of an
effective Hamiltonian. Then, we let momenta and coordinates of the phase space
be noncommutative and introduce a generalized *-genvalue equation. We solve
this equation to find the related Wigner functions and show that under an
appropriate choice of noncommutativity relations they are independent of
noncommutativity parameter.
