  We investigate supersymmetry in one-dimensional quantum mechanics with point
interactions. We clarify a class of point interactions compatible with
supersymmetry and present N=2 supersymmetric models on a circle with two point
interactions as well as a superpotential. A hidden $su(2)$ structure inherent
in the system plays a crucial role to construct the N=2 supercharges.
Spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry due to point interactions is also
discussed.
