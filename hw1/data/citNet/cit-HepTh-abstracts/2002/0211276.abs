  Recent results on zero modes of the Abelian Dirac operator in three
dimensions support to some degree the conjecture that the Chern-Simons action
admits only certain quantized values for gauge fields that lead to zero modes
of the corresponding Dirac operator. Here we show that this conjecture is wrong
by constructing an explicit counter-example.
