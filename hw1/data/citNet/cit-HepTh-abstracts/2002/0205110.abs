  We study the U(1) and U(2) instanton solutions of gauge theory on general
noncommutative $\bf{R}^4$. In all cases considered we obtain explicit results
for the projection operators. In some cases we computed numerically the
instanton charge and found that it is an integer, independent of the
noncommutative parameters $\theta_{1,2}$.
