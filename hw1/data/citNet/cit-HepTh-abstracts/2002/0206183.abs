  We compute RR fields by K-theory for T-dual versions of Type II superstring
theories on a $T^{9-p}$ torus with orientifold planes $Op^\pm$. The RR charges
at cohomology level are also computed. This is done by wrapping D(q+n)-branes
on compact non-trivial homological n-cycles of the transverse space $RP^n$ to
the orientifold in order to build Dq-branes on top of $Op^\pm-$planes. We
compare both of them by K-theory through the Atiyah-Hirzebruch Spectral
Sequence and some new correlations between branes on orientifold planes
$Op^\pm$ and obstructions to the existence of some branes are found. In the
procedure we find a topological condition that fixes the number of the T-dual
versions of the non-BPS D4 and D3 branes in Type USp(32) string theory on
compact spaces, that is actually the topological condition needed to cancel
global gauge anomalies in lower dimensional systems. Finally, for RR fields not
related to any source and classified by K-theory, there is an apparent
T-duality violation. We show that, with a correct interpretation, this is not
the case.
