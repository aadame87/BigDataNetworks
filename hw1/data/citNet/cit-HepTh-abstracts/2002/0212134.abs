  We solve for spectrum, obtain explicitly and study group properties of
eigenfunctions of Dirac operator on the Riemann sphere $S^2$. The eigenvalues
$\lambda$ are nonzero integers. The eigenfunctions are two-component spinors
that belong to representations of SU(2)-group with half-integer angular momenta
$l = |\lambda| - \half$. They form on the sphere a complete orthonormal
functional set alternative to conventional spherical spinors. The difference
and relationship between the spherical spinors in question and the standard
ones are explained.
