  We consider gauge theories with multitrace deformations in the context of
certain AdS/CFT models with explicit breaking of conformal symmetry and
supersymmetry. In particular, we study the standard four-dimensional confining
model based on the D4-brane metric at finite temperature. We work in the
self-consistent Hartree approximation, which becomes exact in the large-N limit
and is equivalent to the AdS/CFT multitrace prescription that has been proposed
in the literature. We show that generic multitrace perturbations have important
effects on the phase structure of these models. Most notably they can induce
new types of large-N first-order phase transitions.
