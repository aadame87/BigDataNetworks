  We apply supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ) to the study
of supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons (SYM-CS) theory on R x S^1 x S^1. One
of the compact directions is chosen to be light-like and the other to be
space-like. Since the SDLCQ regularization explicitly preserves supersymmetry,
this theory is totally finite, and thus we can solve for bound-state wave
functions and masses numerically without renormalizing. The Chern-Simons term
is introduced here to provide masses for the particles while remaining totally
within a supersymmetric context. We examine the free, weak and strong-coupling
spectrum. The transverse direction is discussed as a model for universal extra
dimensions in the gauge sector. The wave functions are used to calculate the
structure functions of the lowest mass states. We discuss the properties of
Kaluza-Klein states and focus on how they appear at strong coupling. We also
discuss a set of anomalously light states which are reflections of the exact
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield states of the underlying SYM theory.
