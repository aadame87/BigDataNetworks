  We study gauge transformations of the Hata-Kawano vector state on a D25-brane
in the framework of vacuum string field theory. We show that among the infinite
number of components of the polarization vector, all the components except one
spacetime vector degree of freedom are gauge freedom, and give string field
gauge transformations reproducing gauge transformations of the constant modes
of the U(1) gauge field. These gauge transformations can be used to fix the
normalization of the vector field. We also discuss a difficulty in obtaining a
gauge invariant action of the vector field. Our arguments rely on the
factorization ansatz of gauge transformations.
