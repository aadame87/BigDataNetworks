  We give observations about dualities where one of the dual theories is
geometric. These are illustrated with a duality between the simple harmonic
oscillator and a topological field theory. We then discuss the Wilson loop in
the context of the AdS/CFT duality. We show that the Wilson loop calculation
for certain asymptotically AdS scalar field spacetimes with naked singularities
gives results qualitatively similar to that for the AdS black hole. In
particular, it is apparent that (dimensional) metric parameters in the singular
spacetimes permit a ``thermal screening'' interpretation for the quark
potential in the boundary theory, just like black hole mass. This suggests that
the Wilson loop calculation merely captures metric parameter information rather
than true horizon information.
