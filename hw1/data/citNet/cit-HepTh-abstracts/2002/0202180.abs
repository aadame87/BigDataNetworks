  We discuss the different bounds on entropy in the context of two-dimensional
cosmology. We show that in order to obtain well definite bounds one has to use
the scale symmetry of the gravitational theory. We then extend the recently
found relation between the Friedmann equation and the Cardy formula to the case
of two dimensions. In particular, we find that in two dimensions this relation
requires that the central charge c of the conformal field theory is given in
terms of the Newton constant G of the gravitational theory by c=6/G.
