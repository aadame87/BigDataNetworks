  This paper is devoted to studying some properties of the Courant algebroids:
we explain the so-called "conducting bundle construction" and use it to attach
the Courant algebroid to Dixmier-Douady gerbe (following ideas of P. Severa).
We remark that WZNW-Poisson condition of Klimcik and Strobl (math.SG/0104189)
is the same as Dirac structure in some particular Courant algebroid. We propose
the construction of the Lie algebroid on the loop space starting from the Lie
algebroid on the manifold and conjecture that this construction applied to the
Dirac structure above should give the Lie algebroid of symmetries in the
WZNW-Poisson $\sigma$-model, we show that it is indeed true in the particular
case of Poisson $\sigma$-model.
