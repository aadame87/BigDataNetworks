  We study cosmological consequences of non-constant brane world moduli in five
dimensional brane world models with bulk scalars and two boundary branes. We
focus on the case where the brane tension is an exponential function of the
bulk scalar field, $U_b \propto \exp{(\alpha \phi)}$. In the limit $\alpha \to
0$, the model reduces to the two-brane model of Randall-Sundrum, whereas larger
values of $\alpha$ allow for a less warped bulk geometry. Using the moduli
space approximation, we derive the four-dimensional low-energy effective action
from a supergravity-inspired five-dimensional theory. For arbitrary values of
$\alpha$, the resulting theory has the form of a bi-scalar-tensor theory. We
show that, in order to be consistent with local gravitational observations,
$\alpha$ has to be small (less than $10^{-2}$) and the separation of the branes
must be large. We study the cosmological evolution of the interbrane distance
and the bulk scalar field for different matter contents on each branes. Our
findings indicate that attractor solutions exist which drive the moduli fields
towards values consistent with observations. The efficiency of the attractor
mechanism crucially depends on the matter content on each branes. In the
five-dimensional description, the attractors correspond to the motion of the
negative tension brane towards a bulk singularity, which signals the eventual
breakdown of the four-dimensional description and the necessity of a better
understanding of the bulk singularity.
