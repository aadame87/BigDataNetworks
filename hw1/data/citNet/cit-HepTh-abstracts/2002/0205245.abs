  We extend the path-integral formalism for Poisson-Lie T-duality to include
the case of Drinfeld doubles which can be decomposed into bi-algebras in more
than one way. We give the correct shift of the dilaton, correcting a mistake in
the litterature. We then use the fact that the six dimensional Drinfeld doubles
have been classified to write down all possible conformal Poisson-Lie T-duals
of three dimensional space times and we explicitly work out two duals to the
constant dilaton and zero anti-symmetric tensor Bianchi type V space time and
show that they satisfy the string equations of motion. This space-time was
previously thought to have no duals because of the tracefulness of the
structure constants.
