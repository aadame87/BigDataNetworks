  We study N=2 nonlinear two dimensional sigma models with boundaries and their
massive generalizations (the Landau-Ginzburg models). These models are defined
over either Kahler or bihermitian target space manifolds. We determine the most
general local N=2 superconformal boundary conditions (D-branes) for these sigma
models. In the Kahler case we reproduce the known results in a systematic
fashion including interesting results concerning the coisotropic A-type branes.
We further analyse the N=2 superconformal boundary conditions for sigma models
defined over a bihermitian manifold with torsion. We interpret the boundary
conditions in terms of different types of submanifolds of the target space. We
point out how the open sigma models correspond to new types of target space
geometry. For the massive Landau-Ginzburg models (both Kahler and bihermitian)
we discuss an important class of supersymmetric boundary conditions which
admits a nice geometrical interpretation.
