Title: Renormalization in quantum Brans-Dicke gravity
Authors: Z. Haba (University of Wroclaw)
Comments: Latex, 9 pages
\\
  In the Brans-Dicke model we treat the scalar field exactly and expand the
gravitational field in a power series. A comparison with 2D sigma models and
\phi^{4} perturbation theory in four dimensions suggests that the perturbation
series in 4D Brans-Dicke model is renormalizable.
