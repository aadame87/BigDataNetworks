Title: Topological charge of Center Vortices
Authors: H. Reinhardt
Comments: Proceedings, Lattice 2002, 3p, latex
\\
  The topological charge of center vortices is discussed in terms of the
self-intersection number of the closed vortex surfaces in 4-dimensional
Euclidian space-time and in terms of the temporal changes of the writhing
number of the time-dependent vortex loops in 3-dimensional space.
