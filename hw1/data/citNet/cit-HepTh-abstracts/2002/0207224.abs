  (2+1)-dimensional Georgi-Glashow model and its SU(N)-generalization are
explored at nonzero temperatures and in the regime when the Higgs boson is not
infinitely heavy. The finiteness of the Higgs-boson mass leads to various novel
effects. Those include the appearance of two separate phase transitions and of
the upper bound on the parameter of the weak-coupling approximation, necessary
to maintain the stochasticity of the Higgs vacuum. The modification of the
finite-temperature behavior of the model emerging due to the introduction of
massless quarks is also discussed.
