  We first discuss how the longstanding confusion in the literature concerning
one-loop quantum corrections to 1+1 dimensional solitons has finally been
resolved. Then we use 't Hooft and Veltman's dimensional regularization to
compute the kink mass, and find that chiral domain wall fermions, induced by
fermionic zero modes, lead to spontaneous parity violation and an anomalous
contribution to the central charge such that the BPS bound becomes saturated.
On the other hand, Siegel's dimensional reduction shifts this anomaly to the
counter terms in the renormalized current multiplet. The superconformal anomaly
is located in an evanescent counter term, and imposing supersymmetry, this
counter term induces the same anomalous contribution to the central charge.
Next we discuss a new regularization scheme: local mode regularization. The
local energy density computed in this scheme satisfies the BPS equality (it is
equal to the local central charge density). In an appendix we give a very
detailed account of the DHN method to compute soliton masses applied to the
supersymmetric kink.
