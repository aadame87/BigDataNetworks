  We investigate vortex solutions to the Abelian Higgs field equations in a
four dimensional de Sitter spacetime background. We obtain both static and
dynamic solutions with axial symmetry that are generalizations of the
Nielsen-Olesen gauge vortices in flat spacetime. The static solution is located
in the static patch of de Sitter space. We numerically solve the field
equations in an inflationary (big bang) patch and find a time dependent vortex
soution, whose effect to create a deficit angle in the spacetime. We show that
this solution can be interpreted in terms of a renormalization group flow in
accord with a generalized {$c$}-theorem, providing evidence in favour of a
dS/CFT correspondence.
