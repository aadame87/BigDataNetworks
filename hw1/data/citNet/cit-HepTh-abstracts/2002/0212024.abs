  The oxidation program of hep-th/0210178 is extended to cover oxidation of 3-d
sigma model theories on a coset G/H, with G non-compact (but not necessarily
split), and H the maximal compact subgroup. We recover the matter content, the
equations of motion and Bianchi identities from group lattice and Cartan
involution. Satake diagrams provide an elegant tool for the computations, the
maximal oxidation dimension, and group disintegration chains can be directly
read off. We give a complete list of theories that can be recovered from
oxidation of a 3 dimensional coset sigma model on G/H, where G is a simple
non-compact group.
