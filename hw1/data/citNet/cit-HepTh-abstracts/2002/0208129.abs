Title: Complex field as inflaton and quintessence
Authors: A.V. Yurov
Comments: 7 pages

  We investigate cosmology with complex scalar field. It is shown that such
models can describe two stages of inflation and the oscillatory regime. Thus we
don't need both quintessence and $\Lambda$-term. It is enough to have single
complex field to obtain both inflation and present accelerated universe. If the
present accelerated expansion was created by the complex field then universe
must escape eternal acceleration. Besides, we will show that cosmological
equations with complex field admit stationary solution without any cosmological
constant.
