  We reconsider light-cone superstring field theory on the maximally
supersymmetric pp-wave background. We find that the results for the fermionic
Neumann matrices given so far in the literature are incomplete and verify our
expressions by relating them to the bosonic Neumann matrices and proving
several non-trivial consistency conditions among them, as for example the
generalization of a flat space factorization theorem for the bosonic Neumann
matrices. We also study the bosonic and fermionic constituents of the prefactor
and point out a subtlety in the relation between continuum and oscillator basis
expressions.
