  We consider the evolution of massive scalar fields in (asymptotically) de
Sitter spacetimes of arbitrary dimension. Through the proposed dS/CFT
correspondence, our analysis points to the existence of new nonlocal dualities
for the Euclidean conformal field theory. A massless conformally coupled scalar
field provides an example where the analysis is easily explicitly extended to
'tall' background spacetimes.
