  We illustrate a basic framework for analytic computations of Feynman graphs
using the Moyal star formulation of string field theory. We present efficient
methods of computation based on (a) the monoid algebra in noncommutative space
and (b) the conventional Feynman rules in Fourier space. The methods apply
equally well to perturbative string states or nonperturbative string states
involving D-branes. The ghost sector is formulated using Moyal products with
fermionic (b,c) ghosts. We also provide a short account on how the purely cubic
theory and/or VSFT proposals may receive some clarification of their midpoint
structures in our regularized framework.
