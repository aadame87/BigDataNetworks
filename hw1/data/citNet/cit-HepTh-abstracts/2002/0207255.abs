  We argue that extremal black holes of N=4 Poincare supergravity coupled to
conformal matter have a quantum-exact dual 5-d description in the maximally
supersymmetric extension of the Randall-Sundrum theory. This dual is a the
classical, static supergravity solution describing a string with both
Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond charge with respect to different antisymmetric tensor
doublets. We also discuss the issue of the singularity present in a class of
such supergravity solutions found by Cvetic, Lu and Pope.
