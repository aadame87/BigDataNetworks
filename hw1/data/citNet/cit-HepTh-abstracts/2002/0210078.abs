  Using the U(4) hybrid formalism, manifestly N=(2,2) worldsheet supersymmetric
sigma models are constructed for the Type IIB superstring in Ramond-Ramond
backgrounds. The Kahler potential in these N=2 sigma models depends on four
chiral and antichiral bosonic superfields and two chiral and antichiral
fermionic superfields. When the Kahler potential is quadratic, the model is a
free conformal field theory which describes a flat ten-dimensional target space
with Ramond-Ramond flux and non-constant dilaton. For more general Kahler
potentials, the model describes curved target spaces with Ramond-Ramond flux
that are not plane-wave backgrounds. Ricci-flatness of the Kahler metric
implies the on-shell conditions for the background up to the usual four-loop
conformal anomaly.
