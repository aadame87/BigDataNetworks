  We present a class of chiral non-supersymmetric D=4 field theories in which
quadratic divergences appear only at two loops. They may be depicted as ``SUSY
quivers'' in which the nodes represent a gauge group with extended e.g., N=4
SUSY whereas links represent bifundamental matter fields which transform as
chiral multiplets with respect to different N=1 subgroups. One can obtain this
type of field theories from simple D6-brane configurations on Type IIA string
theory compactified on a six-torus. We discuss the conditions under which this
kind of structure is obtained from D6-brane intersections. We also discuss some
aspects of the effective low-energy field theory. In particular we compute
gauge couplings and Fayet-Iliopoulos terms from the Born-Infeld action and show
how they match the field theory results. This class of theories may be of
phenomenological interest in order to understand the modest hierarchy problem
i.e., the stability of the hierarchy between the weak scale and a fundamental
scale of order 10-100 TeV which appears e.g. in low string scale models.
Specific D-brane models with the spectrum of the SUSY Standard Model and three
generations are presented.
