Title: Wave function of the radion with BPS branes
Authors: G. Cynolter
Comments: 15 pages, changed references and discussion of the literature
\\
  We investigate coupled gravity and a bulk scalar field on a slice of AdS_5
bulk with special BPS branes at the two ends. With the special scalar
potentials on the branes the scalar field does not stabilize the size of the
orbifold. With a careful treatment of the general coordinate invariance the
complete tensor-scalar spectrum is presented. There are two massless zero modes
in the scalar sector, the radion and a dilatonic zero mode. The scalar KK modes
acquire masses at the order of the warped mass scale. The four dimensional
effective action is of tensor-scalar type.
