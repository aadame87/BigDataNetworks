  We demonstrate how to compute real-time Green's functions for a class of
finite temperature field theories from their AdS gravity duals. In particular,
we reproduce the two-by-two Schwinger-Keldysh matrix propagator from a gravity
calculation. Our methods should work also for computing higher point Lorentzian
signature correlators. We elucidate the boundary condition subtleties which
hampered previous efforts to build a Lorentzian-signature AdS/CFT
correspondence. For two-point correlators, our construction is automatically
equivalent to the previously formulated prescription for the retarded
propagator.
