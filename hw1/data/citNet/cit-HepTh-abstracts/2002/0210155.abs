  In this work we derive two important tools for working in the \kappa basis of
string field theory. First we give an analytical expression for the finite part
of the spectral density \rho_{fin}. This expression is relevant when both
matter and ghost sectors are considered. Then we calculate the form of the
matter part of the Virasoro generators L_n in the \kappa basis, which construct
string field theory's derivation Q_{BRST}. We find that the Virasoro generators
are given by one dimensional delta functions with complex arguments.
