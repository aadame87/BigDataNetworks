  We formulate rational conformal field theory in terms of a symmetric special
Frobenius algebra A and its representations. A is an algebra in the modular
tensor category of Moore-Seiberg data of the underlying chiral CFT. The
multiplication on A corresponds to the OPE of boundary fields for a single
boundary condition. General boundary conditions are A-modules, and
(generalised) defect lines are A-A-bimodules.
  The relation with three-dimensional TFT is used to express CFT data, like
structure constants or torus and annulus coefficients, as invariants of links
in three-manifolds. We compute explicitly the ordinary and twisted partition
functions on the torus and the annulus partition functions. We prove that they
satisfy consistency conditions, like modular invariance and NIM-rep properties.
  We suggest that our results can be interpreted in terms of non-commutative
geometry over the modular tensor category of Moore-Seiberg data.
