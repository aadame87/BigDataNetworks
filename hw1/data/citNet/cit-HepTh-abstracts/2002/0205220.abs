  We derive the gauge invariant perturbation equations for a 5-dimensional bulk
spacetime in the presence of a brane. The equations are derived in full
generality, without specifying a particular energy content of the bulk or the
brane. We do not assume Z_2 symmetry, and show that the degree of freedom
associated with brane motion plays a crucial role. Our formalism may also be
used in the Z_2 symmetric case where it simplifies considerably.
