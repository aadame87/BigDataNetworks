  We found a gravity solution of p+1 dimensional extended object with
SO(p)xSO(9-p) symmetry which has zero pressure and zero dilaton charge. We
expect that this object is a residual tachyon dust after tachyon condensation
of brane and anti-brane system discussed by Sen, recently. We also discuss the
Hawking temperature and some properties of this object.
