  Both in string field theory and in p-adic string theory the equations of
motion involve infinite number of time derivatives. We argue that the initial
value problem is qualitatively different from that obtained in the limit of
many time derivatives in that the space of initial conditions becomes strongly
constrained. We calculate the energy-momentum tensor and study in detail time
dependent solutions representing tachyons rolling on the p-adic string theory
potentials. For even potentials we find surprising small oscillations at the
tachyon vacuum. These are not conventional physical states but rather
anharmonic oscillations with a nontrivial frequency--amplitude relation. When
the potentials are not even, small oscillatory solutions around the bottom must
grow in amplitude without a bound. Open string field theory resembles this
latter case, the tachyon rolls to the bottom and ever growing oscillations
ensue. We discuss the significance of these results for the issues of emerging
closed strings and tachyon matter.
