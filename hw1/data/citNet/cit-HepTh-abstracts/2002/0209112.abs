  We study a family of interacting bosonic representations of the N=2
superconformal algebra. These models can be tensored with a conjugate theory to
give the free theory. We explain how to use free fields to study interacting
fields and their dimensions, and how we may identify different free fields as
representing the same interacting field. We show how a lattice of identifying
fields may be built up and how every free field may be reduced to a standard
form, thus permitting the resolution of the spectrum. We explain how to build
the extended algebra and show that there are a finite number of primary fields
for this algebra for any of the models. We illustrate this by studying an
example.
