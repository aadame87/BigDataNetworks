Title: Inflation via Black Holes with Quantized Area Spectrum
Authors: Tongu\c{c} Rador
Comments: Added a section. Corrected typos
\\
  I present a very simplistic toy model for the inflationary paradigm where the
size of the universe undergoes a period of exponential growth. The basic
assumption I make use of is that black holes might have a quantized area (mass)
spectrum with a stable ground state and that the universe has started with a
tightly packed collection of these objects alone.
