  We study the IR dynamics of the type IIB supergravity solution describing N
D3-branes and M fractional D3-branes on the resolved conifold. The baryon mass
and the tension of domain wall in the dual gauge theory are evaluated and
compared with those for the deformed conifold. The IR behavior of the solution
for the general conifold is also discussed. We show that the area law behavior
of the Wilson loop is attributed to the existence of the locus in the IR where
the D3-brane charge vanishes.
