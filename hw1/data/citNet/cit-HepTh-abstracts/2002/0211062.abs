  We show that the recently obtained class of spacetimes for which all of the
scalar curvature invariants vanish (which can be regarded as generalizations of
pp-wave spacetimes) are exact solutions in string theory to all perturbative
orders in the string tension scale. As a result the spectrum of the theory can
be explicitly obtained, and these spacetimes are expected to provide some hints
for the study of superstrings on more general backgrounds. Since these
Lorentzian spacetimes suffer no quantum corrections to all loop orders they may
also offer insights into quantum gravity.
