  We give a brief account of supersymmetric Born-Infeld theories with extended
supersymmetry, including those with partially broken supersymmetry. Some latest
developments in this area are presented. One of them is N=3 supersymmetric
Born-Infeld theory which admits a natural off-shell formulation in N=3 harmonic
superspace.
