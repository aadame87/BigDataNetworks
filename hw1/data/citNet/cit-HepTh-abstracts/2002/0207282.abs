Title: Comment on "A new, exact, gauge-invariant RG-flow equation"
Authors: Filipe Paccetti Correia
\\
  We show that the exact RG-flow equation introduced recently in hep-th/0207134
can be obtained in the sharp cut-off limit of the well-known ERGE. This can be
expected from the fact that in this limit the new scale-dependent effective
action coincides with the one which is usually considered.
