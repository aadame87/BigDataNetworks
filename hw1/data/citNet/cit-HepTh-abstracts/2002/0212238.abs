  We study the synchrotron radiation in noncommutative electrodynamics at first
order in theta. There are two main results. On the theoretical side, we find an
acausal behavior for the electromagnetic field in the form of time-derivatives
higher than two. This effect naturally arises even if only theta^(12) is
different from zero, and is due to the presence in the theory of two different
speeds of light. On the phenomenological side, we find that the synchrotron
radiation is a very promising candidate to search for experimental evidences of
the effects of noncommutativity or, conversely, to establish tight bounds on
the magnitude of theta.
