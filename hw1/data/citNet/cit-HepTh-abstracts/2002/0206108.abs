  We construct six stack D6-brane vacua (non-supersymmetric) that have at low
energy exactly the standard model (with right handed neutrinos). The
construction is based on D6-branes intersecting at angles in $D = 4$ type
toroidal orientifolds of type I strings. Three U(1)'s become massive through
their couplings to RR fields and from the three surviving massless U(1)'s at
low energies, one is the standard model hypercharge generator. The two extra
massless U(1)'s get broken, as suggested recently (hep-th/0205147), by
requiring some intersections to respect N=1 supersymmetry thus supporting the
appearance of massless charged singlets. Proton and lepton number are gauged
symmetries and their anomalies are cancelled through a generalized
Green-Schwarz mechanism that gives masses to the corresponding gauge bosons
through couplings to RR fields. Thus proton is stable and neutrinos are of
Dirac type with small masses as a result of a PQ like-symmetry. The models
predict the existence of only two supersymmetric particles, superpartners of
$\nu_R$'s.
