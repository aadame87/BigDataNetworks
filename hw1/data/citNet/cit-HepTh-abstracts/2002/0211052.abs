  Matrix Theories with One Flavour

\\
  We derive the superpotential of gauge theories having matter fields in the
fundamental representation of gauge fields by using the method of Dijkgraaf and
Vafa. We treat the theories with one flavour and reproduce a well-known
non-perturbative superpotential for meson field.
