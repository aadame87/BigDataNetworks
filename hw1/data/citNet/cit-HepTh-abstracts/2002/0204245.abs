  Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) theory is a recently proposed theory with two
observer-independent scales (of velocity and mass), which is to describe a
kinematic structure underlining the theory of Quantum Gravity. We observe that
there is infinitely many DSR constructions of the energy-momentum sector, each
of whose can be promoted to the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e quantum (Hopf) algebra.
Then we use the co-product of this algebra and the known construction of
$\kappa$-deformed phase space via Heisenberg double in order to derive the
non-commutative space-time structure and description of the whole of the DSR
phase space. Next we show that contrary to the ambiguous structure of the
energy momentum sector, the space-time of the DSR theory is unique and
equivalent to the theory with non-commutative space-time proposed long ago by
Snyder. This theory provides non-commutative version of Minkowski space-time
enjoying ordinary Lorentz symmetry. It turns out that when one builds a natural
phase space on this space-time, its intrinsic length parameter $\ell$ becomes
observer-independent.
