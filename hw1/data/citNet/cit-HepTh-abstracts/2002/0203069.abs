Title: Beyond the tree level in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: Mattia Jona-Lasinio

  The loop expansion of the effective action is used to evaluate quantum
corrections to a scalar field theory (massive phi^4 model) on AdS. We evaluate
one loop corrections and show that they preserve conformal invariance of the
boundary theory as conjectured by AdS/CFT correspondence.
