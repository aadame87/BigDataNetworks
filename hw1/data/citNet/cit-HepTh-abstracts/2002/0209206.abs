  We analyze the transmission of supersymmetry breaking in brane-world models
of pseudo-supersymmetry. In these models two branes preserve different halves
of the bulk supersymmetry. Thus supersymmetry is broken although each sector of
the model is supersymmetric when considered separately. The world-volume theory
on one brane feels the breakdown of supersymmetry only through two-loop
interactions involving a coupling to fields from the other brane. In a 5D toy
model with bulk vectors, we compute the diagrams that contribute to scalar
masses on one brane and find that the masses are proportional to the
compactification scale up to logarithmic corrections, m^2 ~ (2 pi R)^{-2}(ln(2
pi R ms)-1.1), where ms is an ultraviolet cutoff. Thus, for large
compactification radii, where this result is valid, the brane scalars acquire a
positive mass squared. We also compute the three-loop diagrams relevant to the
Casimir energy between the two branes and find E ~ (2 pi R)^{-4}((ln(2 pi R
ms)-1.7)^2+0.2). For large radii, this yields a repulsive Casimir force.
