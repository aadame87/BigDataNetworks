Title: Comment on "Supersymmetry in the half-oscillator - revisited"
Authors: Ashok Das and S. Pernice
Comments: 2 pages
\\
  We point out the flaw in the analysis of Gangopadhyaya and Mallow,
hep-th/0206133, where it is claimed that supersymmetry is broken in the SUSY
half-oscillator, even with a regularization respecting supersymmetry.
