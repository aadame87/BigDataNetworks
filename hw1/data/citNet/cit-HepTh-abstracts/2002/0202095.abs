  The equations of motion of quantum Yang - Mills theory (in the planar `large
N' limit), when formulated in Loop-space are shown to have an anomalous term,
which makes them analogous to the equations of motion of WZW models. The
anomaly is the Jacobian of the change of variables from the usual ones i.e. the
connection one form $A $, to the holonomy $U$. An infinite dimensional Lie
algebra related to this change of variables (the Lie algebra of loop
substitutions) is developed, and the anomaly is interpreted as an element of
the first cohomology of this Lie algebra. The Migdal-Makeenko equations are
shown to be the condition for the invariance of the Yang-Mills generating
functional $Z$ under the action of the generators of this Lie algebra.
Connections of this formalism to the collective field approach of Jevicki and
Sakita are also discussed.
