  As argued previously, amplitudes of quantum field theories on noncommutative
space and time cannot be computed using naive path integral Feynman rules. One
of the proposals is to use the Gell-Mann--Low formula with time-ordering
applied before performing the integrations. We point out that the previously
given prescription should rather be regarded as an interaction point
time-ordering. Causality is explicitly violated inside the region of
interaction. It is nevertheless a consistent procedure, which seems to be
related to the interaction picture of quantum mechanics. In this framework we
compute the one-loop self-energy for a space/time noncommutative \phi^4 theory.
Although in all intermediate steps only three-momenta play a role, the final
result is manifestly Lorentz covariant and agrees with the naive calculation.
Deriving the Feynman rules for general graphs, we show, however, that such a
picture holds for tadpole lines only.
