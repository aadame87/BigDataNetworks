  If C is a cocommutative coalgebra, a bialgebra structure can be given to the
symmetric algebra S(C). The symmetric product is twisted by a Laplace pairing
and the twisted product of any number of elements of S(C) is calculated
explicitly. This is used to recover important identities in the quantum field
theory of interacting scalar bosons.
