  The microscopic origin of black hole entropy remains one of the more
intriguing open questions in theoretical physics. A subplot in this drama is
the renowned Cardy-Verlinde formula, which uses two-dimensional conformal
formalism to explain the entropy of an arbitrary-dimensional black hole. In
this paper, by exploiting the AdS/CFT and black hole-string dualities, we are
able to provide a physical picture for this paradoxical behavior. Following a
recent study by Haylo (in a dS context), we show that the dual CFT for an
asymptotically AdS spacetime actually conforms to a string-like description.
Moreover, we demonstrate that this stringy CFT is directly related to a string
that lives on the stretched horizon of an AdS-Schwarzschild-like black hole. In
fact, after an appropriate renormalization, these two boundary theories are
shown to be thermodynamically equivalent.
