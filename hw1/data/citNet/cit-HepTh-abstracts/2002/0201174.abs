  Asymptotically de Sitter spaces can be described by Euclidean boundary
theories with entropies given by the modified Cardy--Verlinde formula. We show
that the Cardy--Verlinde formula describes a string with a rescaled tension
which in fact is a string at the stretched cosmological horizon as seen from
the boundary. The temperature of the boundary theory is the rescaled Hagedorn
temperature of the string. Our results agree with an alternative description of
asymptotically de Sitter spaces in terms of strings on the stretched horizon.
The relation between the two descriptions is given by the large gravitational
redshift between the boundary and the stretched horizon and a shift in energy.
