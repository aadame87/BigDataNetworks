  Exact global solutions of five-dimensional cosmological models compactified
on a $S_1/Z_2$ orbifold with two 3-branes are presented, and evolution of a
simple model is studied. It is found that on all 4D spacetime hypersurfaces,
except a singular one, the expanding universe was started not from a big bang
but from a big bounce, and before the bounce the universe was in a deflationary
contracting phase. It is also found that whether the energy density on the
second brane is positive, zero, or negative depends on the size of the fifth
dimension.
