  Coupling any interacting quantum mechanical system to gravity in one
dimension requires the cosmological constant to belong to the matter energy
spectrum and thus to be quantized, even though the gravity sector is free of
any quantum dynamics, while physical states are also confined to the subspace
of matter quantum states whose energy coincides with the cosmological constant
value. These general facts are illustrated through some simple examples. The
physical projector quantization approach readily leads to the correct
representation of such systems, whereas other approaches relying on gauge
fixing methods are often plagued by Gribov problems in which case the
quantization rule is not properly recovered. Whether such a quantization of the
cosmological constant as well as the other ensuing consequences in terms of
physical states extend to higher dimensional matter-gravity coupled quantum
systems is clearly a fascinating open issue.
