  We discuss several examples of three-dimensional critical phenomena that can
be described by Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\phi^4$ theories. We present an
overview of field-theoretical results obtained from the analysis of high-order
perturbative series in the frameworks of the $\epsilon$ and of the
fixed-dimension d=3 expansions. In particular, we discuss the stability of the
O(N)-symmetric fixed point in a generic N-component theory, the critical
behaviors of randomly dilute Ising-like systems and frustrated spin systems
with noncollinear order, the multicritical behavior arising from the
competition of two distinct types of ordering with symmetry O($n_1$) and
O($n_2$) respectively.
