  We analyze the emergence of a minimal length for a large class of generalized
commutation relations, preserving commutation of the position operators and
translation invariance as well as rotation invariance (in dimension higher than
one). We show that the construction of the maximally localized states based on
squeezed states generally fails. Rather, one must resort to a constrained
variational principle.
