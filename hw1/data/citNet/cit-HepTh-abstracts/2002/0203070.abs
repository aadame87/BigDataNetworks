  It is well known but rather mysterious that root spaces of the $E_k$ Lie
groups appear in the second integral cohomology of regular, complex, compact,
del Pezzo surfaces. The corresponding groups act on the scalar fields (0-forms)
of toroidal compactifications of M theory. Their Borel subgroups are actually
subgroups of supergroups of finite dimension over the Grassmann algebra of
differential forms on spacetime that have been shown to preserve the
self-duality equation obeyed by all bosonic form-fields of the theory. We show
here that the corresponding duality superalgebras are nothing but Borcherds
superalgebras truncated by the above choice of Grassmann coefficients. The full
Borcherds' root lattices are the second integral cohomology of the del Pezzo
surfaces. Our choice of simple roots uses the anti-canonical form and its known
orthogonal complement. Another result is the determination of del Pezzo
surfaces associated to other string and field theory models. Dimensional
reduction on $T^k$ corresponds to blow-up of $k$ points in general position
with respect to each other. All theories of the Magic triangle that reduce to
the $E_n$ sigma model in three dimensions correspond to singular del Pezzo
surfaces with $A_{8-n}$ (normal) singularity at a point. The case of type I and
heterotic theories if one drops their gauge sector corresponds to non-normal
(singular along a curve) del Pezzo's. We comment on previous encounters with
Borcherds algebras at the end of the paper.
