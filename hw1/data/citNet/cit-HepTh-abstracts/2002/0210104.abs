  A BCS-type wave function describes the ground state of the massless Thirring
model in the chirally broken phase. The massless Thirring model with fermion
fields quantized in the chirally broken phase bosonizes to the quantum field
theory of the free massless (pseudo)scalar field (Eur. Phys. J. C 20, 723
(2001)). The wave functions of the ground state of the free massless
(pseudo)scalar field are obtained from the BCS wave function by averaging over
quantum fluctuations of the Thirring fermion fields. We show that we obtain
wave functions, orthogonal, normalized and non-invariant under shifts of the
massless (pseudo)scalar field. This testifies the spontaneous breaking of the
field-shift symmetry in the quantum field theory of a free massless
(pseudo)scalar field.
