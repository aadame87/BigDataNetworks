  We study families of PP-wave solutions of type-IIB supergravity that have
(light-cone) time dependent metrics and RR five-form fluxes. They arise as
Penrose limits of supergravity solutions that correspond to rotating or
continuous distributions of D3-branes. In general, the solutions preserve
sixteen supersymmetries. On the dual field theory side these backgrounds
describe the BMN limit of N=4 SYM when some scalars in the field theory have
non-vanishing expectation values. We study the perturbative string spectrum and
in several cases we are able to determine it exactly for the bosons as well as
for the fermions. We find that there are special states for particular values
of the light-cone constant P_+.
