  The Seiberg-Witten map for noncommutative Yang-Mills theories is studied and
methods for its explicit construction are discussed which are valid for any
gauge group. In particular the use of the evolution equation is described in
some detail and its relation to the cohomological approach is elucidated.
Cohomological methods which are applicable to gauge theories requiring the
Batalin-Vilkoviskii antifield formalism are briefly mentioned. Also, the
analogy of the Weyl-Moyal star product with the star product of open bosonic
string field theory and possible ramifications of this analogy are briefly
mentioned.
