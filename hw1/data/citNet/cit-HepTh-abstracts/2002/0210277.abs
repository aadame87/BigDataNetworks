Title: A relativistic superalgebra in a generalized Schroedinger picture
Authors: Rudolf A. Frick
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  We consider a relativistic superalgebra in the picture in which the time and
spatial derivative cannot be presented in the operators of the particle. The
supersymmetry generators as well as the Hamilton operators for the massive
relativistic particles with spin zero and spin-1/2 are expressed in terms of
the principal series of the unitary representations of the Lorentz group. We
also consider the massless case. New Hamilton operators are conctructed for the
massless particles with spin zero and spin 1/2.
