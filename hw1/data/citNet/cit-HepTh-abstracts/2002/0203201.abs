  The geometry of flat spacetime modded out by a null rotation (boost+rotation)
is analysed. When embedding this quotient spacetime in String/M-theory, it
still preserves one half of the original supersymmetries. Its connection with
the BTZ black hole, supersymmetric dilatonic waves and one possible resolution
of its singularity in terms of nullbranes are also discussed.
