  In this paper, we systematically study the effective action for
non-commutative QED in the static limit at high temperature. When $\theta
p^{2}\ll 1$, where $\theta$ represents the magnitude of the parameter for
non-commutativity and $p$ denotes a typical external three momentum, we show
that this leads naturally to a derivative expansion in this model. The study of
the self-energy, in this limit, leads to nontrivial $\theta$ dependent
corrections to the electric and magnetic masses, which exist only above a
certain critical temperature. The three point and the four point amplitudes are
also studied as well as their relations to the Ward identities in this limit.
We determine the closed form expression for the current involving only the
spatial components of the gauge field and propose a gauge invariant
contribution to the corresponding static effective action.
