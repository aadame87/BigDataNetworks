Title: Quantum Discontinuity for Massive Spin 3/2 with a Lambda Term

  We show that the recently demonstrated absence of the van
Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity for massive spin 3/2 with a Lambda term is
an artifact of the tree level approximation, and that the discontinuity
reappears at one loop. As a numerical check on the calculation, we rederive the
vanishing of the one- loop beta function for D=11 supergravity on AdS_4 x S^7
level-by-level in the Kaluza-Klein tower.
