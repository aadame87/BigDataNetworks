Title: Baryons, Boundaries and Matrix Models

  A natural extension of the Dijkgraaf-Vafa proposal is to include fields in
the fundamental representation of the gauge group. In this paper we use field
theory techniques to analyze gauge theories whose tree level superpotential is
a generic polynomial in multi-trace operators constructed out of such fields.
We show that the effective superpotential is generated by planar diagrams with
at most one (generalized) boundary. This justifies the proposal put forward in
hep-th/0211075.
  We then proceed to extend the gauge theory-matrix model duality to include
baryonic operators. We obtain the full moduli space of vacua for an U(N) theory
with N flavors. We also outline a program leading to a string theory
justification of the gauge theory-matrix model correspondence with fundamental
matter.
