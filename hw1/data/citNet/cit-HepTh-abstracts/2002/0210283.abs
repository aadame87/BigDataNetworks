Title: A remark about unitary representations of Lorentz group and an equation
  for zero mass particles
Authors: N.B.Skachkov
Comments: 4 pages, latex
\\
  In the present note the expansion of the wave function of a massless particle
(with the definite value of its helicity) over the untary irreducible
representaions of the Lorentz group (defined on the light cone) is used as for
the analog of the Fourier transformation for deriving of an equation in the
relativistic configuration representation.
