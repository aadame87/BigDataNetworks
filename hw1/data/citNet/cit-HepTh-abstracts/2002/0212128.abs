Title: Soft matrix models and Chern-Simons partition functions

  We study the properties of matrix models with soft confining potentials.
Their precise mathematical characterization is that their weight function is
not determined by its moments. Relying on simple considerations from the moment
problem and orthogonal polynomials, we show general features of their density
of states, correlation functions and loop averages. Some examples are worked
out in detail. In addition, some of these models are equivalent, by a simple
mapping, to matrix models that have appeared recently in connection with
Chern-Simons theory. The models can be solved with q deformed orthogonal
polynomials (Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials), and the deformation parameter turns
out to be the usual $q$ parameter in Chern-Simons theory. In this way, we give
a matrix model computation of the Chern-Simons partition function on $S^{3}$
and show that there are an infinite number of matrix models with this partition
function.
