  We consider the Maldacena-Nunez supergravity solution corresponding to N=1
super Yang-Mills within the approach by Di Vecchia, Lerda and Merlatti. We show
that if one uses the radial distance as a field theory scale, the corresponding
beta function has an infrared fixed point. Assuming this to be a physical
property for all four dimensional non-singular renormalization schemes, we use
the relation between the gaugino condensate and its dual to investigate the
connection between the IR and UV behaviors. Imposing the ``field theory
boundary condition'' that the first two terms in the perturbative UV beta
function are universal, the fixed point is found to be of first order, and the
slope of the IR beta function is also fixed.
