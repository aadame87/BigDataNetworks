  We investigate a string model defined by a special plane-wave metric ds^2 =
2dudv - l(u) x^2 du^2 + dx^2 with l(u) = k/u^2 and k=const > 0. This metric is
a Penrose limit of some cosmological, Dp-brane and fundamental string
backgrounds. Remarkably, in Rosen coordinates the metric has a ``null
cosmology'' interpretation with flat spatial sections and scale factor which is
a power of the light-cone time u. We show that: (i) This spacetime is a
Lorentzian homogeneous space. In particular, like Minkowski space, it admits a
boost isometry in u,v. (ii) It is an exact solution of string theory when
supplemented by a u-dependent dilaton such that its exponent (i.e. effective
string coupling) goes to zero at u=infinity and at the singularity u=0,
reducing back-reaction effects. (iii) The classical string equations in this
background become linear in the light-cone gauge and can be solved explicitly
in terms of Bessel's functions; thus the string model can be directly
quantized. This allows one to address the issue of singularity at the
string-theory level. We examine the propagation of first-quantized
point-particle and string modes in this time-dependent background. Using
certain analytic continuation prescription we argue that string propagation
through the singularity can be smooth.
