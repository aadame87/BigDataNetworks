  Within the context of traditional logarithmic grand unification at M_GUT =
10^(16) GeV, we show that it is nevertheless possible to observe certain GUT
states such as X and Y gauge bosons at lower scales, perhaps even in the TeV
range. We refer to such states as ``GUT precursors.'' Such states offer an
interesting alternative possibility for new physics at the TeV scale, even when
the scale of gauge coupling unification remains high, and suggest that it may
be possible to probe GUT physics directly even within the context of high-scale
gauge coupling unification. More generally, our results also suggest that it is
possible to construct self-consistent ``hybrid'' models containing widely
separated energy scales, and give rise to a Kaluza-Klein realization of
non-trivial fixed points in higher-dimensional gauge theories. We also discuss
how such theories may be deconstructed at high energies.
