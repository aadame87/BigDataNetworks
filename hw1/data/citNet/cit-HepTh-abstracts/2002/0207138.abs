  The Casimir effect due to conformally coupled bulk scalar fields on
background of conformally flat brane-world geometries is investigated. In the
general case of mixed boundary conditions formulae are derived for the vacuum
expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor and vacuum forces acting on
boundaries. The special case of the AdS bulk is considered and the application
to the Randall-Sundrum scenario is discussed. The possibility for the radion
stabilization by the vacuum forces is demonstrated.
