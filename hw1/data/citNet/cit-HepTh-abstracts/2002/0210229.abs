  We study the spectrum of solvable string models on plane waves descending
from non-conformal Dp-brane geometries. We mainly focus on S-dual F1/D1-waves
in type IIB and type I/heterotic 10D superstrings. We derive the Kaluza-Klein
spectrum of N=1,2 10D supergravities on D1/F1-waves. We compute helicity
supertraces counting multiplicities and R-charges of string excitations in the
plane wave geometry. The results are compared against the expectations coming
from gauge/supergravity descriptions. In the type I case, the Klein, Annulus
and Moebius one-loop amplitudes are computed for ten-dimensional D1-waves. We
test the consistency of the open string descendant by showing that after
modular transformations to the closed string channel, the three amplitudes
combine themselves to reconstruct a complete square (|B>+|C>)^2. Tadpole
conditions are also discussed.
