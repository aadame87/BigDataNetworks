  We have analyzed IIB matrix model based on the improved mean field
approximation (IMFA) and have obtained a clue that the four-dimensional
space-time appears as its most stable vacuum. This method is a systematic way
to give an improved perturbation series and was first applied to IIB matrix
model by Nishimura and Sugino. In our previous paper we reformed this method
and proposed a criterion for convergence of the improved series, that is, the
appearance of the ``plateau''. In this paper, we perform higher order
calculations, and find that our improved free energy tends to have a plateau,
which shows that IMFA works well in IIB matrix model.
