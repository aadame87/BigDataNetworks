  In this paper we consider the general setting for constructing Action
Principles for three-dimensional first order autonomous equations. We present
the results for some integrable and non-integrable cases of the Lotka-Volterra
equation, and we show Lagrangian descriptions which are valid for systems
satisfying Shil'nikov criteria on the existence of strange attractors, though
chaotic behavior or homoclinic orbits have not been verified up to now. The
Euler-Lagrange equations we get for these systems usually present "time
reparameterization" symmetry, though other kinds of invariance may be found
according to the kernel of the associated symplectic 2-form. The formulation of
a Hamiltonian structure (Poisson brackets and Hamiltonians) for these systems
from the Lagrangian viewpoint leads to a method of finding new constants of the
motion starting from known ones, which is applied to some systems found in the
literature known to possess a constant of the motion, to find the other and
thus showing their integrability. In particular, we show that the so-called ABC
system is completely integrable if it possesses one constant of the motion.
