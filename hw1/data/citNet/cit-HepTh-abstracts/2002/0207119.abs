Title: Rolling Tachyon in Brane World Cosmology from Superstring Field Theory
Authors: Gary Shiu, S.-H. Henry Tye and Ira Wasserman
Comments: 4 pages, one figure. This version quantifies constraints on various
  phenomenological models for tachyon decay
\\
  The pressureless tachyonic matter recently found in superstring field theory
has an over-abundance problem in cosmology. We argue that this problem is
naturally solved in the brane inflationary scenario if almost all of the
tachyon energy is drained (via its coupling to the inflaton and matter fields)
to heating the universe, while the rest of the tachyon energy goes to a network
of cosmic strings (lower-dimensional BPS D-branes) produced during the tachyon
rolling at the end of inflation.
