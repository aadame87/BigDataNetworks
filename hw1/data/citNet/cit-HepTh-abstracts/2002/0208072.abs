Title: Noncommutative version of an arbitrary nondegenerated mechanics
Authors: A.A. Deriglazov
Comments: 5 pages
\\
  A procedure to obtain noncommutative version for any nondegenerated dynamical
system is proposed and discussed. The procedure is as follow. Let $S=\int dt
L(q^A, ~ \dot q^A)$ is action of some nondegenerated system, and $L_1(q^A, ~
\dot q^A, ~ v_A)$ is the corresponding first order Lagrangian. Then the
corresponding noncommutative version is $S_N=\int dt[ L_1(q^A, ~ \dot q^A, \~
v_A)+ \dot v_A\theta^{AB}v_B]$. Namely, the system $S_N$ has the following
properties: 1) It has the same number of physical degrees of freedom as the
initial system $S$. 2) Equations of motion of the system are the same as for
the initial system $S$, modulo the term which is proportional to the parameter
$\theta^{AB}$. 3) Configuration space variables have the noncommutative
brackets: $\{q^A, ~ q^B\}=-2\theta^{AB}$. It is pointed also that quantization
of the system $S_N$ leads to quantum mechanics with ordinary product replaced
by the Moyal product.
