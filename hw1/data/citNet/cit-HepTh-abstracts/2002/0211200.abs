Title: Cosmological Acceleration from Energy Influx
Author: N. Tetradis (University of Athens)
Comments: 8 pages

  We discuss the cosmological evolution of a 3-brane Universe in the presence
of energy influx from the bulk. We show that this influx can lead to
accelerated expansion on the brane, depending on the equations of state of the
bulk and brane matter. The absorption of non-relativistic bulk matter by the
brane at an increasing rate leads to a small positive acceleration parameter
during the era of matter domination on the brane. On the other hand, the brane
expansion remains decelerating during radiation domination.
