  We provide first explicite examples of quantum deformations of D=4 conformal
algebra with mass-like deformation parameters, in applications to quantum
gravity effects related with Planck mass. It is shown that one of the classical
r-matrices defined on the Borel subalgebra of sl(4) with o(4,2) reality
conditions describes the light-cone \kappa-deformation of D=4 Poincare algebra.
We embed this deformation into the three-parameter family of generalized
\kappa-deformations, with r-matrices depending additionally on the dilatation
generator. Using the extended Jordanian twists framework we describe these
deformations in the form of noncocommutative Hopf algebra. We describe also
another four-parameter class of generalized \kappa-deformations, which is
obtained by continuous deformation of distinguished \kappa-deformation of D=4
Weyl algebra, called here the standard \kappa-deformation of Weyl algebra.
