Title: Regge amplitudes from AdS/CFT duality
Authors: R. Peschanski
Comments: 6 pages, 7 figures, to appear in the proceedings of the 31st
  International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP 2002), Amsterdam, The
  Netherlands, 24-31 July 2002
\\
  String theory has long ago been initiated by the quest for a theoretical
explanation of the observed high-energy ``Regge behaviour'' of strong
interaction amplitudes, but this 35-years-old puzzle is still unsoved. We
discuss how modern tools like the AdS/CFT correspondence give a new insight on
the problem.
