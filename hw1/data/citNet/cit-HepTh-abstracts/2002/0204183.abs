  We discuss the stringy properties of high-energy QCD using its hidden
integrability in the Regge limit and on the light-cone. It is shown that
multi-colour QCD in the Regge limit belongs to the same universality class as
superconformal $\cal{N}$=2 SUSY YM with $N_f=2N_c$ at the strong coupling
orbifold point. The analogy with integrable structure governing the low energy
sector of $\cal{N}$=2 SUSY gauge theories is used to develop the brane picture
for the Regge limit. In this picture the scattering process is described by a
single M2 brane wrapped around the spectral curve of the integrable spin chain
and unifying hadrons and reggeized gluons involved in the process. New
quasiclassical quantization conditions for the complex higher integrals of
motion are suggested which are consistent with the $S-$duality of the
multi-reggeon spectrum. The derivation of the anomalous dimensions of the
lowest twist operators is formulated in terms of the Riemann surfaces
