  We use the process of quantum hamiltonian reduction of SU(2)_k, at rational
level k, to study explicitly the correlators of the h_{1,s} fields in the
c_{p,q} models. We find from direct calculation of the correlators that we have
the possibility of extra, chiral and non-chiral, multiplet structure in the
h_{1,s} operators beyond the `minimal' sector. At the level of the vacuum null
vector h_{1,2p-1}=(p-1)(q-1) we find that there can be two extra non-chiral
fermionic fields. The extra indicial structure present here permeates
throughout the entire theory. In particular we find we have a chiral triplet of
fields at h_{1,4p-1}=(2p-1)(2q-1). We conjecture that this triplet algebra may
produce a rational extended c_{p,q} model. We also find a doublet of fields at
h_{1,3p-1}=(\f{3p}{2}-1)(\f{3q}{2}-1). These are chiral fermionic operators if
p and q are not both odd and otherwise parafermionic.
