Title: Charging Interacting Rotating Black Holes in Heterotic String Theory

  We present a formulation of the stationary bosonic string sector of the whole
toroidally compactified heterotic string theory as a double Ernst system which
describes, in general, two interacting spinning black holes coupled to dilaton
and Kalb--Ramond fields. This subsystem possesses a discrete symmetry which is
used to relate different string vacua, in particular, double Kerr
configurations endowed with dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. Then we
apply the normalized Harrison transformation (a charging symmetry which acts on
the target space of the heterotic string theory preserving the asymptotics of
the transformed fields) on a generic solution of the double Ernst system and
compute the generated field configurations for the effective four--dimensional
heterotic string theory. This transformation generates the U(1) vector field
content of the whole heterotic string spectrum and endows the interacting
rotating black holes with multiple electromagnetic fields.
