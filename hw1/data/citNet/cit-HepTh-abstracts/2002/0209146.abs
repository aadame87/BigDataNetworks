  We study four-point correlation functions with logarithmic behaviour in
Liouville field theory on a sphere, which consist of one kind of the local
operators. We study them as non-integrated correlation functions of the
gravitational sector of two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to an ordinary
conformal field theory in the conformal gauge. We also examine, in the (p,q)
minimal conformal field theories, a condition of the appearance of logarithmic
correlation functions of gravitationally dressed operators.
