Title: Analytic Electroweak Dyon
Authors: Y. M. Cho
Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure
\\
  We present analytic monopole and dyon solutions whose energy is fixed by the
electroweak scale. Our result shows that genuine electroweak monopole and dyon
could exist whose mass scale is much smaller than the grand unification scale.
