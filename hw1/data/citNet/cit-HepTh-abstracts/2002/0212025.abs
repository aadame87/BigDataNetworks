  We investigate in detail the structure of mesonic vacua of N=1 U(Nc)
supersymmetric gauge theory with Nf flavors from the matrix model. We show that
the Witten index from the matrix model calculation agrees with a result from
field theoretical analysis. We also discuss the relationship between a
diagrammatic summation and direct matrix integration with insertion of a
variable changing delta function. Using this formalism, we obtain the quantum
moduli space and evidence of the Seiberg duality from the matrix models.
