Title: Fermionic functionals without Grassmann numbers
Authors: H. Nikolic

  Since any fermionic operator \psi can be written as \psi=q+ip, where q and p
are hermitian operators, we use the eigenvalues of q and p to construct a
functional formalism for calculating matrix elements that involve fermionic
fields. The formalism is similar to that for bosonic fields and does not
involve Grassmann numbers. This makes possible to perform numerical fermionic
lattice computations that are much faster than not only other algorithms for
fermions, but also algorithms for bosons.
