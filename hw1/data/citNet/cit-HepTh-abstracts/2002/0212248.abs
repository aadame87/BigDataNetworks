  We present new rolling tachyon solutions describing the classical decay of
D-branes. Our methods are simpler than those appearing in recent works, yet our
results are exact in classical string theory. The role of pressure in the decay
is studied using tachyon profiles with spatial variation. In this case the
final state involves an array of codimension one D-branes rather than static,
pressureless tachyon matter.
