  In this paper we discuss the question of whether the entropy of cosmological
horizon in Topological Reissner-Nordstr\"om- de Sitter spaces can be described
by the Cardy-Verlinde formula, which is supposed to be an entropy formula of
conformal field theory in any dimension. Furthermore, we find that the entropy
of black hole horizon can also be rewritten in terms of the Cardy-Verlinde
formula for these black holes in de Sitter spaces, if we use the definition due
to Abbott and Deser for conserved charges in asymptotically de Sitter spaces.
Our result is in favour of the dS/CFT correspondence.
