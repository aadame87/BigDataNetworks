  We interpret cosmological evolution holographically as a renormalisation
group flow in a dual Euclidean field theory, as suggested by the conjectured
dS/CFT correspondence. Inflation is described by perturbing around the
infra-red fixed point of the dual field theory. The spectrum of the cosmic
microwave background radiation is determined in terms of scaling violations in
the field theory. The dark energy allows similar, albeit less predictive,
considerations. We discuss the cosmological fine-tuning problems from the
holographic perspective.
