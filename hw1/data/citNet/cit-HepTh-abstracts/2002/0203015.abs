  Standard superspace Feynman diagram rules give one estimate of the onset of
ultraviolet divergences in supergravity and super Yang-Mills theories. Newer
techniques motivated by string theory but which also make essential use of
unitarity cutting rules give another in certain cases. We trace the difference
to the treatment of higher-dimensional gauge invariance in supersymmetric
theories that can be dimensionally oxidized to pure supersymmetric gauge
theories.
