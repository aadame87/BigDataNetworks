  We solve exactly the equations of motion for linearized gravity in the
Randall-Sundrum model with matter on the branes and calculate the Newtonian
limit in it. The result contains contributions of the radion and of the massive
modes, which change considerably Newton's law at small distances. The effects
of "shadow" matter, which lives on the other brane, are considered and compared
with those of ordinary matter for both positive and negative tension branes. We
also calculate light deflection and Newton's law in the zero mode approximation
and explicitly distinguish the contribution of the radion field.
