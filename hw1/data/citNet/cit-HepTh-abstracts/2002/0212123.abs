  A novel geometrical model of a two-brane has been constructed, which is {\it
inherently} noncommutative, without external interactions. We show that the
noncommutative spacetime is to be interpreted as having an {\it internal}
angular momentum throughout. Subsequently, the elementary excitations - {\it
i.e.} point particles - living on the brane are endowed with a {\it spin}. The
study of them reveals in a natural way various signatures of a noncommutative
quantum theory, such as dipolar nature of the basic excitations \cite{jab} and
momentum dependent shifts in the interaction point \cite{big}. The observation
\cite{sw} that noncommutative and ordinary field theories are alternative
descriptions of the same underlying theory, is corroborated here by showing
that they are gauge equivalent. Also, treating the present model as an explicit
example, we show that, even classically, in the presence of constraints, the
equivalence between Nambu-Goto and Polyakov formulations is ! subtle.
