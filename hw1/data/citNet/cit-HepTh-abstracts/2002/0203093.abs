  We show that the string spectrum in the pp-wave limit of AdS_5\times S^5/Z_M
(orbifolded pp-wave) is reproduced from the N=2 quiver gauge theory by
quantizing the Green-Schwarz string theory on the orbifolded pp-wave in light
cone gauge. We find that the twisted boundary condition on the world-sheet is
naturally interpreted from the viewpoint of the quiver gauge theory. The
correction of order g_{YM}^2 to the gauge theory operators agrees with the
result in its dual string theory. We also discuss strings on some other
orbifolded pp-waves.
