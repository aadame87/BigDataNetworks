  We construct light-cone gauge superstring field theory in a pp-wave
background with Ramond-Ramond flux. The leading term in the interaction
Hamiltonian is determined up to an overall function of $p^+$ by requiring
closure of the pp-wave superalgebra. The bosonic and fermionic Neumann matrices
for this cubic vertex are derived, as is the interaction point operator. We
comment on the development of a $1/\mu p^+$ expansion for these results.
