  In the usual d dimensional SO(d) gauged Higgs models with $d$-component Higgs
fields, the 'energies' of the topologically stable solitons are bounded from
below by the Chern-Pontryagin charges. A new class of Higgs models is proposed
here, whose 'energies' are stabilised instead by the winding number of the
Higgs field itself, with no reference to the gauge group. Consequently, such
Higgs models can be gauged by SO(N), with 2 \le N \le d.
