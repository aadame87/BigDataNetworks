  We study the direct interaction between global and local monopoles. While in
two previous papers, the coupling between the two sectors was only indirect
through the coupling to gravity, we here introduce a new term in the potential
that couples the Goldstone field and the Higgs field directly. We investigate
the influence of this term in curved space and compare it to the results
obtained previously.
