  Chern-Simons type gauge field is generated by the means of the singular area
preserving transformations in the lowest Landau level of electrons forming
fractional quantum Hall state. Dynamics is governed by the system of
constraints which correspond to the Gauss law in the non-commutative
Chern-Simons gauge theory and to the lowest Landau level condition in the
picture of composite fermions. Physically reasonable solution to this
constraints corresponds to the Laughlin state. It is argued that the model
leads to the non-commutative Chern-Simons theory of the QHE and composite
fermions.
