Title: Light-Cone Quantization Without Periodic Boundary Conditions
Authors: Masahiro Maeno
Comments: 10 pages, 3 figures
\\
  This paper describes a light-cone quantization of a two-dimensional massive
scalar field without periodic boundary conditions in order to make the
quantization manifestly consistent to causality. For this purpose, the field is
decomposed by the Legendre polynomials. Creation-annihilation operators for
this field are defined and the Fock space was constructed.
