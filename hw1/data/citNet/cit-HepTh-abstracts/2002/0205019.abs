  The Ekpyrotic scenario assumes that our visible Universe is a boundary brane
in a five-dimensional bulk and that the hot Big Bang occurs when a nearly
supersymmetric five-brane travelling along the fifth dimension collides with
our visible brane. We show that the generation of isocurvature perturbations is
a generic prediction of the Ekpyrotic Universe. This is due to the interactions
in the kinetic terms between the brane modulus parametrizing the position of
the five-brane in the bulk and the dilaton and volume moduli. We show how to
separate explicitly the adiabatic and isorcuvature modes by performing a
rotation in field space. Our results indicate that adiabatic and isocurvature
pertubations might be cross-correlated and that curvature perturbations might
be entirely seeded by isocurvature perturbations.
