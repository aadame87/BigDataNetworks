  Following an eight-dimensional gauged supergravity approach we construct the
most general solution describing D6-branes wrapped on a Kahler four-cycle taken
to be the product of two spheres of different radii. Our solution interpolates
between a Calabi-Yau four-fold and the spaces S^2xS^2xS^2xR^2 or S^2xS^2xR^4,
depending on generic choices for the parameters. Then we turn on a background
four-form field strength, corresponding to D2-branes, and show explicitly how
our solution is deformed. For a particular choice of parameters it represents a
flow from a Calabi-Yau four-fold times the three-dimensional Minkowski
space-time in the ultraviolet, to the space-time AdS_4xQ^{1,1,1} in the
infrared. In general, the solution in the infrared has a singularity which
within type-IIA supergravity corresponds to the near horizon geometry of the
solution for the D2-D6 system. Finally, we uncover the relation with work done
in the eighties on Freund-Rubin type compactifications.
