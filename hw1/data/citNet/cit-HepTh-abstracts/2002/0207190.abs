  We study classical solutions in Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase (BMN) matrix
model. A supersymmetric (1/2 BPS) fuzzy sphere is one of the classical
solutions and corresponds to a giant graviton. We also consider other classical
solutions, such as non-supersymmetric fuzzy sphere and harmonic oscillating
gravitons. Some properties of oscillating gravitons are discussed. In
particular, oscillating gravitons turn into usual supergravitons in the limit
mu -> 0. Moreover, we calculate the one-loop effective action around the
supersymmetric fuzzy sphere by the use of the background field method and show
the quantum stability of the giant graviton. Also, the instability of the
non-supersymmetric fuzzy sphere is proven.
