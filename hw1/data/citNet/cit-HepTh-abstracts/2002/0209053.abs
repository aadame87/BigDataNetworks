  We compute the O(1/N) correction to the stability critical exponent, omega,
in the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson model with O(N) x O(m) symmetry at the stable
chiral fixed point and the stable direction at the unstable antichiral fixed
point. Several constraints on the O(1/N) coefficients of the four loop
perturbative beta-functions are computed.
