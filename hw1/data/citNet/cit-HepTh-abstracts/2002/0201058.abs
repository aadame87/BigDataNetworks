  We obtain the magnetic counterpart of the BTZ solution, i.e., the rotating
spacetime of a point source generating a magnetic field in three dimensional
Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. The static
(non-rotating) magnetic solution was found by Clement, by Hirschmann and Welch
and by Cataldo and Salgado. This paper is an extension of their work in order
to include (i) angular momentum, (ii) the definition of conserved quantities
(this is possible since spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter), (iii)
upper bounds for the conserved quantities themselves, and (iv) a new
interpretation for the magnetic field source. We show that both the static and
rotating magnetic solutions have negative mass and that there is an upper bound
for the intensity of the magnetic field source and for the value of the angular
momentum. The magnetic field source can be interpreted not as a vortex but as
being composed by a system of two symmetric and superposed electric charges,
one of the electric charges is at rest and the other is spinning. The rotating
magnetic solution reduces to the rotating uncharged BTZ solution when the
magnetic field source vanishes.
