  We construct smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds Z, torus-fibered over a dP_9 base,
with fundamental group Z_2 X Z_2. To do this, the structure of rational
elliptic surfaces is studied and it is shown that a restricted subset of such
surfaces admit at least a Z_2 X Z_2 group of automorphisms. One then constructs
Calabi-Yau threefolds X as the fiber product of two such dP_9 surfaces,
demonstrating that the involutions on the surfaces lift to a freely acting Z_2
X Z_2 group of automorphisms on X. The threefolds Z are then obtained as the
quotient Z=X/(Z_2 X Z_2). These Calabi-Yau spaces Z admit stable, holomorphic
SU(4) vector bundles which, in conjunction with Z_2 X Z_2 Wilson lines, lead to
standard-like models of particle physics with naturally suppressed nucleon
decay.
