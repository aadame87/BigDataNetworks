  We study some configurations of brane probes which are partially wrapped on
spheres transverse to a stack of non-threshold bound states. The latter are
represented by the corresponding supergravity background. Two cases are
studied: D(10-p)-branes in the background of (D(p-2), Dp) bound states and
D(8-p)-branes in the (NS5, Dp) geometry. By using suitable flux quantization
rules of the worldvolume gauge field, we determine the stable configurations of
the probe. The analysis of the energy and supersymmetry of these configurations
reveals that they can be interpreted as bound states of lower dimensional
objects polarized into a D-brane.
