Title: On Massive Mixed Symmetry Tensor Fields in Minkowski Space and (A)dS
Authors: Yu. M. Zinoviev
Comments: plain LaTeX, 15 pages, no figures
\\
  In this paper we give explicit gauge invariant Lagrangian formulation for
massive theories based on mixed symmetry tensors \Phi_{[\mu\nu],\alpha},
T_{[\mu\nu\alpha],\beta} and R_{[\mu\nu],[\alpha\beta]} both in Minkowski as
well as in (Anti) de Sitter spaces. In particular, we study all possible
massless and partially massless limits for such theories in (A)dS.
