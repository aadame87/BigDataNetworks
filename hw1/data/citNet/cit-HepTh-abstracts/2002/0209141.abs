  We discuss the worldvolume description of intersecting D-branes, including
the metric on the moduli space of deformations. We impose a choice of static
gauge that treats all the branes on an equal footing and describes the
intersection of D-branes as an embedded special Lagrangian three-surface. Some
explicit solutions to these equations are given and their interpretation in
terms of a superpotential on moduli space is discussed. These surfaces arise
from flat direction of a non-Abelian superpotential and imply the existance of
non-compact G_2 manifolds.
