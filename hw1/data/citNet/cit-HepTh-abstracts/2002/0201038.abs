Title: Knot Theory from the Perspective of Field and String Theory
Authors: Jose M. F. Labastida

\\
  I present a summary of the recent progress made in field and string theory
which has led to a reformulation of quantum-group polynomial invariants for
knots and links into new polynomial invariants whose coefficients can be
described in topological terms. The approach opens a new point of view in the
theory of knot and link invariants.
