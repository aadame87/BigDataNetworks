  We analyze the fluctuations of Nielsen-Olesen vortices arising in the
six-dimensional Abelian-Higgs model. The regular geometry generated by the
defect breaks spontaneously six-dimensional Poincar\'e symmetry leading to a
warped space-time with finite four-dimensional Planck mass. As a consequence,
the zero mode of the spin two fluctuations of the geometry is always localized
but the graviphoton fields, corresponding to spin one metric fluctuations, give
rise to zero modes which are not localized either because of their behaviour at
infinity or because of their behaviour near the core of the vortex. A similar
situation occurs for spin zero fluctuations. Gauge field fluctuations exhibit a
localized zero mode.
