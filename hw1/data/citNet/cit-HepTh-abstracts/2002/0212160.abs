  We calculate one-loop scattering amplitudes for gravitons and two-forms in
dimensions greater than four. The string based Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relationships
allow gravitons and two-forms to be treated in a unified manner. We use the
results to determine the ultra-violet infinities present in these amplitudes
and show how these determine the renormalised one-loop action in six and eight
dimensions.
