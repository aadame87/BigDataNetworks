  We explore the bubble spacetimes which can be obtained from double analytic
continuations of static and rotating black holes in anti-de Sitter space. In
particular, we find that rotating black holes with elliptic horizon lead to
bubble spacetimes only in dimension greater than five. For dimension greater
than seven, the topology of the bubble can be non-spherical. However, a bubble
spacetime is shown to arise from a rotating de Sitter black hole in four
dimensions. In all cases, the evolution of the bubble is of de Sitter type.
Double analytic continuations of hyperbolic black holes and branes are also
discussed.
