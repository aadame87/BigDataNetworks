  We study the corrections induced by a baryon vertex to the superpotential of
SQCD with gauge group SU(N) and N quark flavors. We first compute the
corrections order by order using a standard field theory technique and derive
the corresponding glueball superpotential by "integrating in" the glueball
field. The structure of the corrections matches with the expectations from the
recently introduced perturbative techniques. We then compute the first
non-trivial contribution using this new technique and find exact quantitative
agreement. This involves cancellations between diagrams that go beyond the
planar approximation.
