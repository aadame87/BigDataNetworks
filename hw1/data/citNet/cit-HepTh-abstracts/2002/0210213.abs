Title: Two-dimensional gravity with an invariant energy scale and arbitrary
  dilaton potential
Authors: S. Mignemi
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX
\\
  We investigate a model of two-dimensional gravity with arbitrary scalar
potential obtained by gauging a deformation of de Sitter or more general
algebras, which accounts for the existence of an invariant energy scale. We
obtain explicit solutions of the field equations and discuss their properties.
