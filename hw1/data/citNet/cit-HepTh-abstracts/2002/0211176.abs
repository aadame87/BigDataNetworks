  The superfield formulation of the theory is systematically used to
demonstrate the absence of quadratic divergences in the effective action up to
two-loop order. The one-loop corrections to the gauge superfield three-point
function is studied in detail in the covariant as well as in the Wess-Zumino
gauge. We make some observations concerning the one-loop corrections of
higher-point functions of the gauge superfield.
