Title: SUSY vs E8 Gauge Theory in 11 Dimensions

  Diaconescu, Moore and Witten have shown that the topological part of the
M-theory partition function is an invariant of an E8 gauge bundle over the
11-dimensional bulk. This presents a puzzle as an 11d gauge theory cannot
exhibit linearly realized supersymmetry. One possibility is that the gauge
theory is nonsupersymmetric and flows to 11d SUGRA only in the infrared, with
SUSY arising as a low energy accidental degeneracy. Although no such gauge
theory has been constructed, any such construction must satisfy a number of
constraints in order to correctly reproduce the known 10-dimensional physics on
each boundary component. We analyze these constraints and in particular use
them to attempt an approximate construction of the 11d gravitino as a
condensate of the gauge theory fields.
