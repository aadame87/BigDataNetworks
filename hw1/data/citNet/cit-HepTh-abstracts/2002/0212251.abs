  A physical applicability of normed split-algebras, such as hyperbolic
numbers, split-quaternions and split-octonions is considered. We argue that the
observable geometry can be described by the algebra of split-octonions, which
is naturally equipped by zero divisors (the elements of split- algebras
corresponding to zero norm). In such a picture physical phenomena are described
by the ordinary elements of chosen algebra, while the zero divisors give raise
the coordinatization and two fundamental constants, namely velocity of light
and Planck constant. It turns to be possible that uncertainty principle appears
from the condition of positively defined norm, and has the same geometrical
meaning as the existence of the maximal value of speed. The property of
non-associativity of octonions could correspond to the appearance of
fundamental probabilities in physics. Grassmann elements and a
non-commutativity of space coordinates, which are widely used in various
physical theories, appear naturally in our approach.
