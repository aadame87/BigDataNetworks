  Contributions to the bound-state dynamics of fermions in local quantum field
theory from the region of large relative momenta of the constituent particles,
are studied and compared in two different approaches. The first approach is
conventionally developed in terms of bare fermions, a Tamm-Dancoff truncation
on the particle number, and a momentum-space cutoff that requires counterterms
in the Fock-space Hamiltonian. The second approach to the same theory deals
with bound states of effective fermions, the latter being derived from a
suitable renormalization group procedure. An example of two-fermion bound
states in Yukawa theory, quantized in the light-front form of dynamics, is
discussed in detail. The large-momentum region leads to a buildup of
overlapping divergences in the bare Tamm-Dancoff approach, while the effective
two-fermion dynamics is little influenced by the large-momentum region. This is
illustrated by numerical estimates of the large-momentum contributions for
coupling constants on the order of between 0.01 and 1, which is relevant for
quarks.
