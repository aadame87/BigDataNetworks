  We study confinement in softly broken N=2 SUSY QCD with gauge group SU(N_c)
and N_f hypermultiplets of fundamental matter (quarks) when the Coulomb branch
is lifted by small mass of adjoint matter. Concentrating mostly on the theory
with SU(3) gauge group we discuss the N=1 vacua which arise in the weak
coupling at large values of quark masses and study flux tubes and monopole
confinement in these vacua. In particular we find the BPS strings in SU(3)
gauge theory formed by two interacting U(1) gauge fields and two scalar fields
generalizing ordinary Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices. Then we focus on the
SU(3) gauge theories with N_f=4 and N_f=5 flavors with equal masses. In these
theories there are N=1 vacua with restored SU(2) gauge subgroup in quantum
theory since SU(2) subsectors are not asymptotically free. We show that
although the confinement in these theories is due to Abelian flux tubes the
multiplicity of meson spectrum is the same as expected in a theory with
non-Abelian confinement.
