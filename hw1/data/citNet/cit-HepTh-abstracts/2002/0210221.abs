  A precise form of the time evolution of rolling tachyons corresponding to a
brane-antibrane pair is investigated by solving the Hamiltonian equations of
motion under the assumption that in a region far away from branes the tachyon
vacuum is almost already achieved, even at the beginning of the rolling.
