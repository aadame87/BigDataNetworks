  For many cases, the conditions to fully embed a classical solution of one
field theory within a larger theory cannot be met. Instead, we find it useful
to embed only the solution's asymptotic fields as this relaxes the embedding
constraints. Such asymptotically embedded defects have a simple classification
that can be used to construct classical solutions in general field theories.
