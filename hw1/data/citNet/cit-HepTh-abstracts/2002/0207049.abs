  We analyze the effect of heavy fundamentally charged particles on the finite
temperature deconfining phase transition in the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow
model. We show that in the presence of fundamental matter the transition turns
into a crossover. The near critical theory is mapped onto the 2 dimensional
Ising model in an external magnetic field. Using this mapping we determine the
width of the crossover region as well as the specific heat as a function of the
fundamental mass.
