  We develop a systematic approach to G_2 holonomy manifolds with an
SU(2)xSU(2) isometry using maximal eight-dimensional gauged supergravity to
describe D6-branes wrapped on deformed three-spheres. A quite general metric
ansatz that generalizes the celebrated Bryant-Salamon metric involves nine
functions. We show that only six of them are the independent ones and derive
the general first order system of differential equations that they obey. As a
byproduct of our analysis, we generalize the notion of the twist that relates
the spin and gauge connections in a way that involves non-trivially the scalar
fields.
