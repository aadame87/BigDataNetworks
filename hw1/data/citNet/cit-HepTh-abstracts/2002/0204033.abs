  We consider the matrix model associated with pp-wave background and construct
supersymmetric branes. In addition to the spherical membrane preserving 16
supersymmetries, one may construct rotating elliptic membranes preserving 8
supersymmetries. The other branch describes rotating 1/8 BPS hyperbolic branes
in general. When the angular momentum vanishes in this branch, the hyperbolic
brane becomes 1/4 BPS preserving 8 real supersymmetries. It may have the shape
of hyperboloid of one or two sheets embedded in the flat three space. We study
the spectrum of the worldvolume fields on the hyperbolic branes and show that
there are no massless degrees. We also compute the spectrum of the 0-2 strings.
