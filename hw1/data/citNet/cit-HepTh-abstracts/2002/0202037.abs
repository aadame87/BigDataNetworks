  It is shown that a localized four-dimensional Einstein term, induced by
quantum corrections, modifies significantly the law of gravity in a
Randall-Sundrum brane world. In particular, the short-distance behavior of
gravity changes from five- to four-dimensional, while, depending on the values
of parameters, there can be an intermediate range where gravity behaves as in
five dimensions. The spectrum of graviton fluctuations around the brane, their
relative importance for the gravitational force, and the relevance of their
emission in the bulk for the brane cosmology are analysed. Finally, constraints
on parameters are derived from energy loss in astrophysical and particle
physics processes.
