  Motivated by application of current superalgebras in the study of disordered
systems such as the random XY and Dirac models, we investigate $gl(2|2)$
current superalgebra at general level $k$. We construct its free field
representation and corresponding Sugawara energy-momentum tensor in the
non-standard basis. Three screen currents of the first kind are also presented.
