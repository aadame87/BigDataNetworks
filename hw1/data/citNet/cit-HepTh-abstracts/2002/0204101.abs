  By studying singularities in stationary axisymmetric Kerr and Tomimatsu-Sato
solutions with distortion parameter \d = 2, 3, ... in general relativity, we
conclude that these singularities can be regarded as nothing other than closed
string-like circular mass distributions. We use two different regularizations
to identify \d-function type singularities in the energy-momentum tensor for
these solutions, realizing a regulator independent result. This result gives
supporting evidence that these axisymmetric exact solutions may well be the
classical solutions around closed string-like mass distributions, just like
Schwarzschild solution corresponding to a point mass distribution. In other
words, these axisymmetric exact solutions may well provide the classical
backgrounds around closed strings.
