  We refute the claim that previous works on the one-loop quantum mass of
solitons had incorrectly dropped a surface term from a partial integration.
Rather, the paper quoted in the title contains a fallacious derivation with two
compensating errors. We also remark that the $\phi^2\cos^2\ln(\phi^2)$ model
considered in that paper does not have solitons at the quantum level because at
two-loop order the degeneracy of the vacua is lifted. This may be remedied,
however, by a supersymmetric extension.
