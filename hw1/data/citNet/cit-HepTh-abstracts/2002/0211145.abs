  We address the problems of fermions in light front QCD on a transverse
lattice. We propose and numerically investigate different approaches of
formulating fermions on the light front transverse lattice. In one approach we
use forward and backward derivatives. There is no fermion doubling and the
helicity flip term proportional to the fermion mass in the full light front QCD
becomes an irrelevant term in the free field limit. In the second approach with
symmetric derivative (which has been employed previously in the literature),
doublers appear and their occurrence is due to the decoupling of even and odd
lattice sites. We study their removal from the spectrum in two ways namely,
light front staggered formulation and the Wilson fermion formulation. The
numerical calculations in free field limit are carried out with both fixed and
periodic boundary conditions on the transverse lattice and finite volume
effects are studied. We find that an even-odd helicity flip symmetry on the
light front transverse lattice is relevant for fermion doubling.
