Title: Seiberg-Witten map for noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory

  In this letter we derive the Seiberg-Witten map for noncommutative super
Yang-Mills theory in Wess-Zumino gauge. Following (and using results of)
hep-th/0108045 we split the observer Lorentz transformations into a covariant
particle Lorentz transformation and a remainder which gives directly the
Seiberg-Witten differential equations. These differential equations lead to a
theta-expansion of the noncommutative super Yang-Mills action which is
invariant under commutative gauge transformations and commutative observer
Lorentz transformation, but not invariant under commutative supersymmetry
transformations: The theta-expansion of noncommutative supersymmetry leads to a
theta-dependent symmetry transformation. For this reason the Seiberg-Witten map
of super Yang-Mills theory cannot be expressed in terms of superfields.
