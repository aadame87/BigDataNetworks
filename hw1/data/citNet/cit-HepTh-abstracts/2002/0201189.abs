  In this Letter we study the dependence of the spectrum of fluctuations in
inflationary cosmology on possible effects of trans-Planckian physics, using
the Corley/Jacobson dispersion relations as an example. We compare the methods
used in previous work [1] with the WKB approximation, give a new exact
analytical result, and study the dependence of the spectrum obtained using the
approximate method of Ref. [1] on the choice of the matching time between
different time intervals. We also comment on recent work subsequent to Ref. [1]
on the trans-Planckian problem for inflationary cosmology.
