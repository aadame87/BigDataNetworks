  After reviewing the main characteristics of the spacetime of accelerating
universes driven by a quintessence scalar field with constant equation of state
$\omega$, we investigate in this paper the classical stability of such spaces
to cosmological perturbations, particularizing in the case of a closed geometry
and equation of state $\omega=-2/3$. We conclude that this space is classically
stable and conjecture that accelerating universes driven by quintessential
fields have "no-hair".
