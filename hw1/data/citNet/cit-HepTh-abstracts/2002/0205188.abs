  A low energy iteration scheme to study nonlinear gravity in the brane world
is developed. As a result, we obtain the brane world effective action at low
energies. The relation between the geometrical approach and the approach using
the AdS/CFT correspondence is also clarified. In particular, we find
generalized dark radiation as homogeneous solutions in our iteration scheme.
Moreover, the precise correspondence between the bulk geometry and the brane
effective action is established, which gives a holographic view of the brane
world.
