  We advocate a method to improve systematically the self-consistent harmonic
approximation (or the Gaussian approximation), which has been employed
extensively in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. We
demonstrate the {\em convergence} of the method in a model obtained from
dimensional reduction of SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory in $D$ dimensions. Explicit
calculations have been carried out up to the 7th order in the large-N limit,
and we do observe a clear convergence to Monte Carlo results. For $D \gtrsim
10$ the convergence is already achieved at the 3rd order, which suggests that
the method is particularly useful for studying the IIB matrix model, a
conjectured nonperturbative definition of type IIB superstring theory.
