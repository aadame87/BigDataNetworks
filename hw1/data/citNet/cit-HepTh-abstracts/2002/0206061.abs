Title: The Invariant Charges of the Nambu-Goto String Theory: Quantization of
  Non-Additive Composition Laws
Authors: K. Pohlmeyer and M. Trunk
Comments: 23 pages LaTeX
\\
  We examine and implement the concept of non-additive composition laws in the
quantum theory of closed bosonic strings moving in (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski
space. Such laws supply exact selection rules for the merging and splitting of
closed strings.
