  We presented a new physical model that links the maximum speed of light with
the minimal Planck scale into a maximal-acceleration Relativity principle in
the spacetime tangent bundle and in phase spaces (cotangent bundle). The
maximal proper-acceleration bound is a = c^2/ \Lambda in full agreement with
the old predictions of Caianiello, the Finslerian geometry point of view of
Brandt and more recent results in the literature. Inspired by the
maximal-acceleration corrections to the Lamb shifts of one-electron atoms by
Lambiase, Papini and Scarpetta, we derive the exact integral equation that
governs the Renormalization-Group-like scaling dependence of the fractional
change of the fine structure constant as a function of the cosmological
redshift factor and a cutoff scale L_c, where the maximal acceleration
relativistic effects are dominant. A particular physical model exists dominated
entirely by the vacuum energy, when the cutoff scale is the Planck scale, with
\Omega_\Lambda \sim 1 . The implications of this extreme case scenario are
studied.
