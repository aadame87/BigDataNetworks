Title: Discrete mechanics Based on Finite Element Methods
Authors: Jing-bo Chen, Han-Ying Guo, and Ke Wu
Comments: 14 pages, 0 figures
\\
  Discrete Mechanics based on finite element methods is presented in this
paper. We also explore the relationship between this discrete mechanics and
Veselov discrete mechanics. High order discretizations are constructed in terms
of high order interpolations.
