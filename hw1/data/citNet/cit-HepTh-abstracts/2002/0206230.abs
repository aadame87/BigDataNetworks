  The equations for the solitons arbitrarily rotating in the ordinary and
isotopic space are obtained. The wave functions of the corresponding dynamic
states in the quantum case are found. The generalized matrix of the moments of
inertia is degenerate for the O(2)-invariant configurations characteristic for
the nucleon and delta-isobar. The equation for such configurations is
established. It is shown that the spin-isospin rotation prevents the collapse
of the soliton states in the SU(2) sigma-model. The entire consideration is
based on the variational approach to the method of collective variables.
