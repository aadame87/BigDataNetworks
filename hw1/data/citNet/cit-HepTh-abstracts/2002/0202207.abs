  The effective average action of Yang-Mills theory is analyzed in the
framework of exact renormalization group flow equations. Employing the
background-field method and using a cutoff that is adjusted to the spectral
flow, the running of the gauge coupling is obtained on all scales. In four
dimensions and for the gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3), the coupling approaches a
fixed point in the infrared.
