  The supersymmetry constraints on the $\hat{G}^{4}\lamda^{16}$ term in the
effective action of type IIB superstring theory are studied in order to
determine the dependence of its coefficient on the complex scalar field,
$\tau$. The resulting expression is consistent with the $SL(2,{\Bbb Z})$
invariant conjectures in the literature.
