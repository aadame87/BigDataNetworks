Title: Vortices under S-duality
Authors: John H. Brodie
Comments: 5 pages, 1 figure
\\
  We investigate a system of 1,3, and 7-branes in type IIB string theory. We
identify the 1-brane with the vortex of the Abelian Higgs model. We claim that
in the S-dual, the theory on the 3-brane confines electric flux which we
identify with the fundamental string and that the dual photon has a mass. We
then investigate ways of breaking supersymmetry in the brane set up.
