  These lectures provide an introduction to the microscopic description of
branes in curved backgrounds. After a brief reminder of the flat space theory,
the basic principles and techniques of (rational) boundary conformal field
theory are presented in the second lecture. The general formalism is then
illustrated through a detailed discussion of branes on compact group manifolds.
In the final lecture, many more recent developments are reviewed, including
some results for non-compact target spaces.
