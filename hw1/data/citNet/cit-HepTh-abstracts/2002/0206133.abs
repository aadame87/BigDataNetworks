Title: Supersymmetry in the Half-Oscillator - Revisited

  Following a recent study by Das and Pernice [Nucl. Phys. B561, (1999) 357],
we have carefully analyzed the half-harmonic oscillator. In contrast to their
observations, our analysis reveals that the spectrum does not allow for a zero
energy ground state and hence the supersymmetry is broken when the domain is
restricted to the positive half of the real axis.
