  We study quark confinement in a system of two parallel domain walls
interpolating different color dielectric media. We use the phenomenological
approach in which the confinement of quarks appears considering the QCD vacuum
as a color dielectric medium. We explore this phenomenon in QCD$_2$, where the
confinement of the color flux between the domain walls manifests, in a scenario
where two 0-branes (representing external quark and antiquark) are connected by
a QCD string. We obtain solutions of the equations of motion via first-order
differential equations. We find a new color confining potential that increases
monotonically with the distance between the domain walls.
