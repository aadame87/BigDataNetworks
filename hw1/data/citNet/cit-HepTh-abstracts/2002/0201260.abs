Title: Dual Brane Pairs, Chains and the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy
Authors: Axel Krause
Comments: 12 pages, 1 figure
\\
  Dual Euclidean brane pairs of type II String- and M-Theory wrapping a
two-sphere are used to express the D=4 Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a
non-rotating D=4 spacetime in terms of a product of the branes' Nambu-Goto
actions. For this we identify the sphere with the event-horizon of the D=4
spacetime. Working in the strongly-coupled regime, we propose to relate a
Euclidean brane's tension to the inverse of a smallest volume unit. The ensuing
discretization of the branes' worldvolumes makes it possible to consider long
chains. By counting their number we can reproduce the D=4 Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy and its logarithmic correction.
