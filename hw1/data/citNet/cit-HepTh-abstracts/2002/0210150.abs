  We derive and generalize the RR twisted tadpole cancellation conditions
necessary to obtain consistent D=4, Z_N orbifold compactifications of Type IIB
string theory. At least two different types of branes (or antibranes with
opposite RR charges) are introduced into the construction. The matter spectra
and their contribution to the non-abelian gauge anomalies are computed. Their
relation with the tadpole cancellation conditions is also reviewed. The
presence of tachyons is a common feature for some of the non-supersymmetric
systems of branes.
