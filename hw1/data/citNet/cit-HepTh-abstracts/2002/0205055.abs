  Cosmological observations suggest the existence of two different kinds of
energy densities dominating at small ($ \lesssim 500$ Mpc) and large ($\gtrsim
1000 $ Mpc) scales. The dark matter component, which dominates at small scales,
contributes $\Omega_m \approx 0.35$ and has an equation of state $p=0$ while
the dark energy component, which dominates at large scales, contributes
$\Omega_V \approx 0.65$ and has an equation of state $p\simeq -\rho$. It is
usual to postulate wimps for the first component and some form of scalar field
or cosmological constant for the second component. We explore the possibility
of a scalar field with a Lagrangian $L =- V(\phi) \sqrt{1 - \del^i \phi \del_i
\phi}$ acting as {\it both} clustered dark matter and smoother dark energy and
having a scale dependent equation of state. This model predicts a relation
between the ratio $ r = \rho_V/\rho_{\rm DM}$ of the energy densities of the
two dark components and expansion rate $n$ of the universe (with $a(t) \propto
t^n$) in the form $n = (2/3) (1+r) $. For $r \approx 2$, we get $n \approx 2$
which is consistent with observations.
