  We study the four-dimensional gravitational fluctuation on anisotropic brane
tension embedded in braneworlds with vanishing bulk cosmological constant. In
this setup, warp factors have two types (A and B) and we point out that the two
types correspond to positive and negative tension brane, respectively. We show
that volcano potential in the model of type A has singularity and the usual
Newton's law is reproduced by the existence of normalizable zero mode. While,
in the case of type B, the effective Planck scale is infinite so that there is
no normalizable zero mode.
