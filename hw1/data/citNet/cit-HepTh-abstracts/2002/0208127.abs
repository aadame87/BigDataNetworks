  A BPS exact wall solution is found in N=1 supergravity in four dimensions.
The model uses chiral scalar field with a periodic superpotential admitting
winding numbers. Maintaining the periodicity in supergravity requires a
gravitational correction to superpotential which allows the exact solution. By
introducing boundary cosmological constants, we construct non-BPS multi-wall
solutions for which a systematic analytic approximation is worked out for small
gravitational coupling.
