  It is shown how in principle for non-abelian gauge theories it is possible in
the finite volume hamiltonian framework to make sense of calculating the
expectation value of ||A||^2=\int d^3x(A^a_i(x))^2. Gauge invariance requires
one to replace ||A||^2 by its minimum over the gauge orbit, which makes it a
highly non-local quantity. We comment on the difficulty of finding a gauge
invariant expression for ||A||^2_{min} analogous to that found for the abelian
case, and the relation of this question to Gribov copies. We deal with these
issues by implementing the hamiltonian on the so-called fundamental domain,
with appropriate boundary conditions in field space, essential to correctly
represent the physics of the problem.
