  Wilson loops in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory correspond at
strong coupling to extremal surfaces in $AdS_5$. We study a class of extremal
surfaces known as special Legendrian submanifolds. The "hemisphere"
corresponding to the circular Wilson loop is an example of a special Legendrian
submanifold, and we give another example. We formulate the necessary conditions
for the contour on the boundary of $AdS_5$ to be the boundary of the special
Legendrian submanifold and conjecture that these conditions are in fact
sufficient. We call the solutions of these conditions "special contact Wilson
loops". The first order equations for the special Legendrian submanifold impose
a constraint on the functional derivatives of the Wilson loop at the special
contact contour which should be satisfied in the Yang-Mills theory at strong
coupling.
