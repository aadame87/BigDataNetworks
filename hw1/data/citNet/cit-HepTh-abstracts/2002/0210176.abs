  Static, spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein--Kalb--Ramond (KR)
field equations are obtained. Besides an earlier known exact solution, we also
find an approximate, asymptotically flat solution for which the metric
coefficients are obtained as an infinte series in $\frac{1}{r}$. Subsequently,
we study gravitational lensing and perihelion precession in these spacetimes
and obtain explicit formulae which include corrections to these effects in the
presence of the KR field.
