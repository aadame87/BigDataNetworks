  We study the standard angular momentum algebra $[x_i,x_j]=i\lambda
\epsilon_{ijk}x_k$ as a noncommutative manifold $R^3_\lambda$. We show that
there is a natural 4D differential calculus and obtain its cohomology and Hodge
* operator. We solve the spin 0 wave equation and some aspects of the Maxwell
or electromagnetic theory including solutions for a uniform electric current
density, and we find a natural Dirac operator. We embed $R^3_\lambda$ inside a
4D noncommutative spacetime which is the limit $q\to 1$ of q-Minkowski space
and show that $R^3_\lambda$ has a natural quantum isometry group given by the
quantum double $D(U(su(2)))$ as a singular limit of the $q$-Lorentz group. We
view $\R^3_\lambda$ as a collection of all fuzzy spheres taken together. We
also analyse the semiclassical limit via minimum uncertainty states
$|j,\theta,\phi>$ approximating classical positions in polar coordinates.
