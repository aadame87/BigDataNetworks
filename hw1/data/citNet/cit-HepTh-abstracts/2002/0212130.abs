Title: Born-Infeld inflates Bianchi cosmologies
Authors: Ricardo Garcia-Salcedo and Nora Breton
Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures
\\
  We present the study of spacetimes conformal to some Bianchi cosmologies with
a Born-Infeld nonlinear electromagnetic source. We determine that the
Born-Infeld field favours inflation. This effect is compared with the
corresponding to a linear electromagnetic field; it turns out that for the same
geometry, Maxwell field does not produce inflation. The energy conditions are
analized as well, showing that the Born-Infeld field violates the strong energy
condition.
