  We investigate the phenomenon of brane induced supersymmetry breakdown on
orbifolds in the presence of a Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. General consistency
conditions are derived for arbitrary dimensions and the results are illustrated
in the specific example of a 5-dimensional theory compactified on $S^1/Z_2$.
This includes a discussion of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and the possibility of
a brane induced supersymmetry restoration.
