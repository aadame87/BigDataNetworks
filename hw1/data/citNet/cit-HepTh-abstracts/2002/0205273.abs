  Recently, Batalin and Marnelius proposed a superfield algorithm for master
actions in the BV-formulation for a class of first order gauge field theories.
Possible theories are determined by a ghost number prescription and a simple
local master equation. We investigate consistent solutions of these local
master equations with emphasis on four and six dimensional theories.
