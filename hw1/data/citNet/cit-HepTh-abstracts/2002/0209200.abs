  We find the parameters of the MSSM in terms of bulk supergravity fields for
the D-brane model of Berenstein, Jejjala and Leigh (hep-ph/0105042). The model
consists of a D3-brane at the singularity of a non-abelian orbifold
\Delta_{27}, which gives the particles of the Supersymmetric Standard Model. We
compute the action for the D-brane fields in the presence of both
supersymmetric and supersymmetry breaking background fluxes. We get quark,
lepton, gaugino, Higgsino, scalar partners and Higgs masses, as well as soft
trilinear couplings, as functions of the background fields. This work develops
a framework for connecting MSSM phenomenology to brane compactifications.
