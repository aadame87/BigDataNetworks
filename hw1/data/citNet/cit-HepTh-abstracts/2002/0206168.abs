  We derive a general expression for the gauge invariant mass (m_G) for an
Abelian gauge field, as induced by vacuum polarization, in 1+1 dimensions. From
its relation to the chiral anomaly, we show that m_G has to satisfy a certain
quantization condition. This quantization can be, on the other hand, explicitly
verified by using the exact general expression for the gauge invariant mass in
terms of the fermion propagator. This result is applied to some explicit
examples, exploring the possibility of having interesting physical situations
where the value of $m_G$ departs from its canonical value. We also study the
possibility of generalizing the results to the 2+1 dimensional case at finite
temperature, showing that there are indeed situations where a finite and
non-vanishing gauge invariant mass is induced.
