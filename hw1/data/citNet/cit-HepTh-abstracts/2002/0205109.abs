  We construct a Penrose limit of AdS_4 x M^{1,1,1} where M^{1,1,1}= SU(3) x
SU(2) x U(1)/(SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)) that provides the pp-wave geometry equal to
the one in the Penrose limit of AdS_4 x S^7. There exists a subsector of three
dimensional N=2 dual gauge theory which has enhanced N=8 maximal supersymmetry.
We identify operators in the N=2 gauge theory with supergravity KK excitations
in the pp-wave geometry and describe how the gauge theory operators made out of
two kinds of chiral fields of conformal dimension 4/9, 1/3 fall into N=8
supermultiplets.
