  We describe various aspects of plane wave backgrounds. In particular, we make
explicit a simple criterion for singularity by establishing a relation between
Brinkmann metric entries and diffeomorphism-invariant curvature information. We
also address the stability of plane wave backgrounds by analyzing the
fluctuations of generic scalar modes. We focus our attention on cases where
after fixing the light-cone gauge the resulting world sheet fields appear to
have negative "mass terms". We nevertheless argue that these backgrounds may be
stable.
