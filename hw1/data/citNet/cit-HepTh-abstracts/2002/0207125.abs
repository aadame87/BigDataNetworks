  We elucidate the relationship between supersymmetric D3-branes and chiral
baryonic operators in the AdS/CFT correspondence. For supersymmetric
backgrounds of the form AdS_5 x H, we characterize via holomorphy a large
family of supersymmetric D3-brane probes wrapped on H. We then quantize this
classical family of probe solutions to obtain a BPS spectrum which describes
D3-brane configurations on H. For the particular examples H = T^{1,1} and H =
S^5, we match the BPS spectrum to the spectrum of chiral baryonic operators in
the dual gauge theory.
