  Just as non-commutative gauge theories arise from quantising open strings in
a large magnetic field, non-Abelian two-form gauge theories may conceivably be
constructed by quantising open membranes in a large three-form magnetic
background. We make some observations that arise in following this strategy,
with an emphasis on the relation to the quantisation of volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms (vpd). In particular, we construct consistent non-Abelian
interactions of a two-form in 3+1 dimensions, based on gauge invariance under
vpd.
