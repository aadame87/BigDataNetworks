  The effects of higher order gravity terms on a dilatonic brane world model
are discussed. For a single positive tension flat 3-brane, and one infinite
extra dimension, we present a particular class of solutions with finite
4-dimensional Planck scale and no naked singularities. A `self-tuning'
mechanism for relaxing the cosmological constant on the brane, without a
drastic fine tuning of parameters, is discussed in this context.
