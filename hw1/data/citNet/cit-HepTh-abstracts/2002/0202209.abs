  By considering the B-field dynamical and studying its interaction with
Ramond-Ramond (RR) background we observe the breaking of the B-field gauge
symmetry in the effective action. This effect takes place due to
non-perturbative coupling of the B-field to membrane topological charge. As a
result, the B-field is renormalized in the RR backgrounds, making it impossible
to obtain consistent non-commutative models with constant B-field.
 We argue that the gauge invariance is restored by introducing appropriate
external D-brane configuration.
