Title: Computation of the Chiral Anomaly in the Bulk Quantization
Authors: Thomas Klose and Sorin Marculescu
Comments: 19 pages
\\
  The bulk quantization method is used for regularizing a conventional four
dimensional theory of massless fermions coupled to an external non-Abelian
gauge field and for subsequently evaluating the associated Ward identity. As a
result one obtains the well-known chiral anomaly.
