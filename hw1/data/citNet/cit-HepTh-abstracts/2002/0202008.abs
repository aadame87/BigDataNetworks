  Assuming the existence of a $dS/CFT$ correspondence we study the holograms of
sources moving along geodesics in the bulk by calculating the one point
functions they induce in the boundary theory. In analogy with a similar study
of uniformly accelerated sources in $AdS$ spacetime, we argue that comoving
geodesic observers correspond to a coordinate system on the boundary in which
the one point function is {\it constant}. For $dS_3$ we show that the conformal
transformations on the boundary which achieve this - when continued suitably to
Lorentzian signature - induce nontrivial Bogoliubov transformations between
modes, leading to a thermal spectrum. This may be regarded as a holographic
signature of thermality detected by bulk geodesic observers.
