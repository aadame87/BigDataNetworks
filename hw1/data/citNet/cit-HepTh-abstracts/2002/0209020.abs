  We show how higher-genus su(N) fusion multiplicities may be computed as the
discretized volumes of certain polytopes. The method is illustrated by explicit
analyses of some su(3) and su(4) fusions, but applies to all higher-point and
higher-genus su(N) fusions. It is based on an extension of the realm of
Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles by including so-called gluing and loop-gluing
diagrams. The identification of the loop-gluing diagrams is our main new
result, since they enable us to characterize higher-genus fusions in terms of
polytopes. Also, the genus-2 0-point su(3) fusion multiplicity is found to be a
simple binomial coefficient in the affine level.
