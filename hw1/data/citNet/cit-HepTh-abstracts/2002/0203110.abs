  We propose an algebraic description of (untwisted) D-branes on compact group
manifolds $G$ using quantum algebras related to $U_q(\mg)$. It reproduces the
known characteristics of stable branes in the WZW models, in particular their
configurations in $G$, energies as well as the set of harmonics. Both generic
and degenerate branes are covered.
