Title: Fractal Theory Space: Spacetime of Noninteger Dimensionality
Authors: Christopher T. Hill
Comments: 28 pages, 6 figures; Paper has been amplified with a more detailed
  discussion of a number of technical issues
\\
  We construct matter field theories in ``theory space'' that are fractal, and
invariant under geometrical renormalization group (RG) transformations. We
treat in detail complex scalars, and discuss issues related to fermions,
chirality, and Yang-Mills gauge fields. In the continuum limit these models
describe physics in a noninteger spatial dimension which appears above a RG
invariant ``compactification scale,'' M. The energy distribution of KK modes
above M is controlled by an exponent in a scaling relation of the vacuum energy
(Coleman-Weinberg potential), and corresponds to the dimensionality. For
truncated-s-simplex lattices with coordination number s the spacetime
dimensionality is 1+(3+2ln(s)/ln(s+2)). The computations in theory space
involve subtleties, owing to the 1+3 kinetic terms, yet the resulting
dimensionalites are equivalent to thermal spin systems. Physical implications
are discussed.
