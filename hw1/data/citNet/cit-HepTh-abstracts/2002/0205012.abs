  Bulk matter modes of higher dimensional models generically become unstable in
the presence of additional matter multiplets at the branes. This quantum
instability is driven by localized Fayet-Iliopoulos terms that attract the bulk
zero modes towards the boundary branes. We study this mechanism in the
framework of a 5 dimensional S^1/Z_2 orbifold and give conditions for the
various possibilities of localization of (chiral) zero modes. This mechanism is
quite relevant for realistic model building, as the standard model contains
U(1) hypercharge with potentially localized FI-terms. The analysis is closely
related to localized anomalies in higher dimensional gauge theories. Five
dimensional gauge invariance of the effective action determines the anomaly
constraints and fixes the normalization of Chern-Simons terms. The localization
of the bulk modes does not effect the anomaly cancellation globally, but the
additional heavy Kaluza-Klein modes of the bulk fields may cancel the
Chern-Simons terms. We discuss also the potential appearance of the parity
anomaly that might render the construction of some orbifold models
inconsistent.
