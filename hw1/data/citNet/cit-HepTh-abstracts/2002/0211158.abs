  Consistent nontrivial interactions within a special class of covariant
mixed-symmetry type tensor gauge fields of degree three are constructed from
the deformation of the solution to the master equation combined with specific
cohomological techniques. In spacetime dimensions strictly greater than four,
the only consistent interaction terms are those gauge invariant under the
original symmetry. Only in four spacetime dimensions the gauge symmetry is
found deformed.
