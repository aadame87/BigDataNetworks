  We discuss the problem of introducing background spacetimes of the de Sitter
type (quintessential backgrounds) in the context of fundamental theories
involving supersymmetry. The role of a model presented in 1984, showing that
these backgrounds can occur as spontaneously broken phases of locally
supersymmetric 4D, N-extended theories, is highlighted. The present twin
challenges of the presumed presence of supersymmetry in particle physics and
the emergence of experimental evidence for a positive cosmological constant
from type-II supernovae data are noted for the continued investigation of
superstring/M-theory. Finally we note how the 1984-model may have a role to
play in future investigations.
