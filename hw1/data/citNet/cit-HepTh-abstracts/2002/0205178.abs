  We investigate for the N = 2 supersymmetry (SUSY) a relation between a vector
supermultiplet of the linear SUSY and the Volkov-Akulov model of the nonlinear
SUSY. We express component fields of the vector supermultiplet in terms of
Nambu-Goldstone fermion fields at the leading orders in a SUSY invariant way,
and show the vector nature of the U(1) gauge field explicitly. A relation of
the actions for the two models is also discussed briefly.
