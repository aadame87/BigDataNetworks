  We review a recent progress in constructing the low-energy effective action
of N=4 SYM theory. This theory is formulated in terms of N=2 harmonic
superfields corresponding to N=2 vector multiplet and hypermultiplet. Such a
formulation possesses the manifest N=2 supersymmetry and an extra hidden
on-shell supersymmetry. Exploring the hidden N=2 supersymmetry we proved that
the known non-holomorphic potentials of the form ln W ln \bar{W} can be
explicitly completed by the appropriate hypermultiplet-dependent terms to the
entire N=4 supersymmetric form. The non-logarithmic effective potentials do not
admit an N=4 completion and, hence, such potentials cannot occur in N=4
supersymmetric theory. As a result we obtain the exact N=4 supersymmetric
low-energy effective action in N=4 SYM theory.
