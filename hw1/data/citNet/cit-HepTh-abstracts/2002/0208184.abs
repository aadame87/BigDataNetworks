  The action for a non-BPS p=2 brane embedded in a flat N=1, D=4 target
superspace is obtained through the method of nonlinear realizations of the
associated super-Poincare symmetries. The brane excitation modes correspond to
the Nambu-Goldstone degrees of freedom resulting from the broken space
translational symmetry and the target space supersymmetries. The action for
this p=2 brane is found to be an invariant synthesis of the Akulov-Volkov and
Nambu-Goto actions. The dual D2-brane Born-Infeld action is derived. The
invariant coupling of matter fields localized on the brane to the
Nambu-Goldstone modes is also obtained.
