  We show that Pauli's spin-statistics relation remains valid in noncommutative
quantum field theories (NC QFT), with the exception of some peculiar cases of
noncommutativity between space and time. We also prove that, while the
individual symmetries C and T, and in some cases also P, are broken, the CPT
theorem still holds in general for noncommutative field theories, in spite of
the inherent nonlocality and violation of Lorentz invariance.
