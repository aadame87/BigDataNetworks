  Much of the recent progress in String Theory can be traced to a precise
strategy: a careful study of the few models known since the beginnings of the
subject, and the abstraction from them of basic properties that one would like
to demand from other models. This could be termed a set of "model-building
rules". The approach corresponds to the fact, often a source of embarrassment
to specialists, that String Theory, born as a set of rules rather than as a set
of principles, has long resisted attempts to reduce it to a logically
satisfying structure.
