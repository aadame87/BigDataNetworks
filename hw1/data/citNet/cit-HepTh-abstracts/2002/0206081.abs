  We study the behavior of the Wilson loop in the (5+1)-dimensional
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the presence of the solitonic object.
Using the dual string description of the Yang-Mills theory that is given by the
D1/D5 system, we estimate the Wilson loops both in the temporal and spatial
cases. For the case of the temporal loop, we obtain the velocity dependent
potential. For the spatial loop, we find that the area law is emerged due to
the effect of the D1-branes. Further, we consider D1/D5 system in the presence
of the constant B field. It is found that the Wilson loop obeys the area law
for the effect of the noncommutativity.
