  We investigate deconstruction of five dimensional supersymmetric abelian
gauge theories compactified on $S_1/Z_2$, with various sets of bulk and matter
multiplets. The problem of anomalies, chirality and stability in the
deconstructed theories is discussed. We find that for most of the 5d brane/bulk
matter assignments there exists the deconstructed version. There are, however,
some exceptions.
