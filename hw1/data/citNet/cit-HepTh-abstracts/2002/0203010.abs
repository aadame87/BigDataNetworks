  We discuss the Hawking radiation in the Higgs-Yukawa system and we show
dynamical formation of a spherical domain wall around the black hole. The
formation of the spherical wall is a general property of the black hole whose
Hawking temperature is equal to or greater than the energy scale of the system.
The formation of the electroweak wall and that of the GUT wall are shown as
realistic cases. We also discuss a phenomenon of the spontaneous charging-up of
the black hole. The Hawking radiation can charge-up the black hole itself by
the charge-transportation due to the spherical wall when C- and CP-violation in
the wall are assumed. The black hole with the electroweak wall can obtain a
large amount of the hyper charge.
