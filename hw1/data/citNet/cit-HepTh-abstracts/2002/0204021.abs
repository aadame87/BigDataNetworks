Title: The Semiclassical Instability of de Sitter Space
Author: Mikhail S. Volkov
Comments: 13 pages. Talk given at the workshop ``Quantum Gravity and Strings'',
  Dubna, June 2001
\\
  The effect of the spontaneous nucleation of black holes in de Sitter space is
reviewed, and the main steps of the calculation in Nucl.Phys. B 582, 313, 2000
of the one-loop amplitude of this process are summarized. The existence of such
an effect suggests that de Sitter space is not a ground state of quantum
gravity with a positive cosmological constant.
