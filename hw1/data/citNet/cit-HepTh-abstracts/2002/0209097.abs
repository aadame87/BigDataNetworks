Title: On contractions of classical basic superalgebras

  We define a class of orthosymplectic $osp(m;j|2n;\omega)$ and unitary
$sl(m;j|n;\epsilon)$ superalgebras which may be obtained from $osp(m|2n)$ and
$sl(m|n)$ by contractions and analytic continuations in a similar way as the
special linear, orthogonal and the symplectic Cayley-Klein algebras are
obtained from the corresponding classical ones. Casimir operators of
Cayley-Klein superalgebras are obtained from the corresponding operators of the
basic superalgebras. Contractions of $sl(2|1)$ and $osp(3|2)$ are regarded as
an examples.
