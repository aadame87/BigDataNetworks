  We obtain the Penrose limit of NCYM theories in dimensions $3 \leq d \leq 6$
which originate from (D$(p-2)$, D$p$) supergravity bound state configurations
for $2 \leq p \leq 5$ in the so-called NCYM limit. In most cases the Penrose
limit does not lead to solvable string theories except for six-dimensional NCYM
theory. We obtain the masses of various bosonic coordinates and observe that
they are light-cone time dependent and their squares can be negative as has
also been observed in other cases in the literature. When the non-commutative
effect is turned off we recover the results of Penrose limit of ordinary
D$p$-branes in the usual YM limit. We point out that for $d = 6$ NCYM theory,
there exists another null geodesic in the neighborhood of which the Penrose
limit leads to a solvable string theory. We briefly discuss the quantization of
this theory.
