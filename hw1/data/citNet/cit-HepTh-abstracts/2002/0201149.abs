  We analytically prove that the matter solution of vacuum string field theory
constructed by Kostelecky and Potting is the matter sliver state. We also give
an analytical proof that the ghost solution by Hata and Kawano is the sliver
state in the twisted ghost CFT. It is also proved that the candidate state for
the tachyon proposed by Hata and Kawano can be identified with the state
constructed by Rastelli, Sen and Zwiebach using CFT. Our proofs are based on
the techniques recently developed by Okuyama.
