  We consider the process of black hole formation in particle collisions in the
exactly solvable framework of 2+1 dimensional Anti de Sitter gravity. An
effective Hamiltonian describing the near horizon dynamics of a head on
collision is given. The Hamiltonian exhibits a universal structure, with a
formation of a horizon at a critical distance. Based on it we evaluate the
action for the process and discuss the semiclassical amplitude for black hole
formation. The derived amplitude is seen to contain no exponential suppression
or enhancement. Coments on the CFT description of the process are made.
