  We use matrix model technology to study the N=2 U(N) gauge theory with N_f
massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. We perform a
completely perturbative calculation of the periods a_i and the prepotential
F(a) up to the first instanton level, finding agreement with previous results
in the literature. We also derive the Seiberg-Witten curve and differential
from the large-M solution of the matrix model. We show that the two cases N_f<N
and N \le N_f < 2N can be treated simultaneously.
