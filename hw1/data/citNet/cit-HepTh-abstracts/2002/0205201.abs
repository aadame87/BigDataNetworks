  This is a slightly expanded version of my talk at Future Perspectives in
Theoretical Physics and Cosmology, Stephen Hawking's 60th Birthday Worshop. I
describe some of the issues that were important in gauged supergravity in the
1980's and how these, and related issues have once again become important in
the study of holographic field theories.
