Title: An Algorithm for the Microscopic Evaluation of the Coefficients of the
  Seiberg-Witten Prepotential
Authors: R. Flume and R. Poghossian
Comments: LaTeX, 23 pages; typos are corrected, determinant formula is
  simplified
\\
  A procedure, allowing to calculate the coefficients of the SW prepotential in
the framework of the instanton calculus is presented. As a demonstration
explicit calculations for 2, 3 and 4- instanton contributions are carried out.
