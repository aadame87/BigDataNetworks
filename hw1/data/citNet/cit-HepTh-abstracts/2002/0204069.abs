  In the first part of this lecture, the 1/N expansion technique is illustrated
for the case of the large-N sigma model. In large-N gauge theories, the 1/N
expansion is tantamount to sorting the Feynman diagrams according to their
degree of planarity, that is, the minimal genus of the plane onto which the
diagram can be mapped without any crossings. This holds both for the usual
perturbative expansion with respect to powers of {tilde g}^2=g^2 N, as well as
for the expansion of lattice theories in positive powers of 1/{tilde g}^2. If
there were no renormalization effects, the tilde g expansion would have a
finite radius of convergence. The zero-dimensional theory can be used for
counting planar diagrams. It can be solved explicitly, so that the generating
function for the number of diagrams with given 3-vertices and 4-vertices, can
be derived exactly. This can be done for various kinds of Feynman diagrams. We
end with some remarks about planar renormalization.
