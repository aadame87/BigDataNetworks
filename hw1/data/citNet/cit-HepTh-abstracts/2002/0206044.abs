  We explore the cosmological solutions of classes of non-linear bigravity
theories. These theories are defined by effective four-dimensional Lagrangians
describing the coupled dynamics of two metric tensors, and containing, in the
linearized limit, both a massless graviton and an ultralight one. We focus on
two paradigmatic cases: the case where the coupling between the two metrics is
given by a Pauli-Fierz-type mass potential, and the case where this coupling
derives from five-dimensional brane constructions. We find that cosmological
evolutions in bigravity theories can be described in terms of the dynamics of
two ``relativistic particles'', moving in a curved Lorenzian space, and
connected by some type of nonlinear ``spring''. Classes of bigravity
cosmological evolutions exhibit a ``locking'' mechanism under which the two
metrics ultimately stabilize in a bi-de-Sitter configuration, with relative
(constant) expansion rates. In the absence of matter, we find that a generic
feature of bigravity cosmologies is to exhibit a period of cosmic acceleration.
This leads us to propose bigravity as a source of a new type of dark energy
(``tensor quintessence''), exhibiting specific anisotropic features. Bigravity
could also have been the source of primordial inflation.
