  We obtain an analytic approximation for the effective action of a quantum
scalar field in a general static two-dimensional spacetime. We apply this to
the dilaton gravity model resulting from the spherical reduction of a massive,
non-minimally coupled scalar field in the four-dimensional Schwarzschild
geometry. Careful analysis near the event horizon shows the resulting
two-dimensional system to be regular in the Hartle-Hawking state for general
values of the field mass, coupling, and angular momentum, while at spatial
infinity it reduces to a thermal gas at the black-hole temperature.
