  We study excited spherical branes (``giant gravitons'') in $AdS \times S$
spacetimes with background flux. For large excitation, these branes may be
treated semiclassically. We compute their spectra using Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization and use the AdS/CFT correspondence to relate them to anomalous
dimensions in the dual field theory at strong coupling, expressed as a series
expansion in powers of 1/N. These effects resemble those due to $k$-body forces
between quarks in Hartree-Fock models of baryons at large $N$. For branes
expanded in AdS, we argue that the anomalous dimensions are due to loop
corrections to the effective action.
