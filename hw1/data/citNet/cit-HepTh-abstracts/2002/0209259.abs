Title: Noncommutativity Parameter and Composite Fermions

  In this note, we would like to determine some particular values of
noncommutativity parameter $\te$ and show that the Murthy-Shankar approach is
in fact a particular case of a more general one. Indeed, using fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE) experimental data, one can give a measurement of
$\te$. This measurement can be obtained by considering some values of the
filling factor $\nu$ and other ingredients, magnetic field $B$ and electron
density $\rho$. Moreover, it is found $\te$ can be quantized either
fractionally or integrally in terms of the magnetic length $l_0$ and the
quantization is exactly what Murthy and Shankar formulated recently for FQHE.
On the other hand, we show that the mapping of FQHE in terms of the composite
fermion basis has a noncommutative geometry nature and therefore there is a
more general way than the Murthy-Shankar method to do this map.
