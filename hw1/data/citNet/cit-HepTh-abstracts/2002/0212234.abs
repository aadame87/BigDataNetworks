  It is shown that the SO(3) gauge field configurations can be completely
characterised by certain gauge invariant vector fields. The singularities of
these vector fields describe the topological aspects of the gauge field
configurations. The topological (or monopole) charge is expressed in terms of
an Abelian vector potential.
