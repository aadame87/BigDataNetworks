Title: A comment on causality
Authors: Ricardo Bentin
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We start from the well-known form of the interval of the special relativity,
stare it, and build up an attempt to implement the causality from it. Some
features appear to be new, they involve the mass of the particle and the
structure of space-time.
