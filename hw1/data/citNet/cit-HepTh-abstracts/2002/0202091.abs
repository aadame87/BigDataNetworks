  Negative energy objects generally lead to instabilities and a number of other
disturbing behaviors. In particular, negative energy fluxes lead to a breakdown
of the classical area theorem for black hole horizons, which can lead to
violations of the second law of thermodynamics. The negative energy objects
that arise in string theory involve special boundary conditions which remove
the perturbative instabilities. We show that they have additional special
features which allow them to evade contradiction with the second law. We
identify one mechanism which applies for most orientifold planes in string
theory, and distinct mechanisms for the O8-plane and the AdS soliton.
