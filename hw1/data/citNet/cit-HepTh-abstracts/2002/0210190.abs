  We first review the construction of the supersymmetric extension of the
(quantum) Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) models. We stress the remarkable fact
that this extension is completely captured by the insertion of a fermionic
exchange operator in the Hamiltonian: sCMS models ({\it s} for supersymmetric)
are nothing but special exchange-type CMS models. Under the appropriate
projection, the conserved charges can thus be formulated in terms of the
standard Dunkl operators. This is illustrated in the rational case, where the
explicit form of the $4N$ ($N$ being the number of bosonic variables) conserved
charges is presented, together with their full algebra. The existence of $2N$
commuting bosonic charges settles the question of the integrability of the
srCMS model. We then prove its superintegrability by displaying $2N-2$ extra
independent charges commuting with the Hamiltonian. In the second part, we
consider the supersymmetric version of the trigonometric case (stCMS model) and
review the construction of its eigenfunctions, the Jack superpolynomials. This
leads to closed-form expressions, as determinants of determinants involving
supermonomial symmetric functions. Here we focus on the main ideas and the
generic aspects of the construction: those applicable to all models whether
supersymmetric or not. Finally, the possible Lie superalgebraic structure
underlying the stCMS model and its eigenfunctions is briefly considered.
