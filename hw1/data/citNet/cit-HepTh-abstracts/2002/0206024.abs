  We present a supersymmetric version of the two-brane Randall-Sundrum
scenario, with arbitrary brane tensions T_1 and T_2, subject to the bound
|T_{1,2}| \leq \sqrt{-6\Lambda_5}, where \Lambda_5 < 0 is the bulk cosmological
constant. Dimensional reduction gives N=1, D=4 supergravity, with cosmological
constant \Lambda_4 in the range \half\Lambda_5 \leq \Lambda_4 \leq 0. The case
with \Lambda_4 = 0 requires T_1 = -T_2 = \sqrt{-6\Lambda_5}. This work unifies
and generalizes previous approaches to the supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum
scenario. It also shows that the Randall-Sundrum fine-tuning is not a
consequence of supersymmetry.
