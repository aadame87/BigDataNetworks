Title: M-theory on manifolds of $G_{2}$ holonomy: the first twenty years
Authors: M. J. Duff
Comments: After the completion of this work, a G\"{o}del universe with 14
  supersymmetries was discovered, consistent with generalized holonomy.

  In 1981, covariantly constant spinors were introduced into Kaluza-Klein
theory as a way of counting the number of supersymmetries surviving
compactification. These are related to the {\it holonomy} group of the
compactifying manifold. The first non-trivial example was provided in 1982 by
D=11 supergravity on the squashed $S^{7}$, whose $G_{2}$ holonomy yields N=1 in
D=4. In 1983, another example was provided by D=11 supergravity on $K3$, whose
SU(2) holonomy yields half the maximum supersymmetry. In 2002, $G_{2}$ and $K3$
manifolds continue to feature prominently in the full D=11 M-theory and its
dualities. In particular, singular $G_{2}$ compactifications can yield chiral
$(N=1,D=4)$ models with realistic gauge groups. The notion of generalized
holonomy is also discussed.
