  We consider the breaking of 5D SUSY $G=SU(N+K)$ gauge symmetry into
$H=SU(N)\times SU(K)\times U(1)$ on an orbifold $S^1/(Z_2\times Z'_2)$. There
appear two independent fixed points: one respects the full bulk gauge symmetry
$G$ while the other contains only the unbroken gauge symmetry $H$. In the model
with one bulk $(N+K)$-plet, giving a $K$-plet as the zero mode, we show that
localized gauge anomalies appear at the fixed points: the $H^3$ gauge anomalies
are equally distributed on both fixed points and the $H-(G/H)-(G/H)$ mixed
gauge anomalies contribute only at the fixed point with $G$ symmetry. We also
find that when we add a brane $\bar K$-plet in the field theoretic limit of a
bulk field, the theory with the unbroken gauge group can be consistent up to
the introduction of a bulk non-abelian Chern-Simons term. Moreover, for our set
of bulk and brane fields, we find that a nonzero log Fayet-Iliopoulos term is
radiatively generated at the fixed point with $H$, which gives rise to the
localization of the bulk zero mode at that fixed point and modifies the massive
modes without changing the KK mode spectrum.
