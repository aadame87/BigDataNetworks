  Drawing analogies with block spin techniques used to study continuum limits
in critical phenomena, we attempt to block up D-branes by averaging over near
neighbour elements of their (in general noncommuting) matrix coordinates, i.e.\
in a low energy description. We show that various classes of D-brane
(noncommutative) geometries appear to behave sensibly under blocking up, given
certain key assumptions, in particular involving gauge invariance. In
particular, blocking up on the noncommutative plane moves towards a commutative
limiting Riemannian plane. This suggests that the commutative description is a
coarse-grained approximation to the noncommutative one, in the sense that
functions on the noncommutative geometry that have a matrix-Taylor expansion
collapse down under blocking up to their coarse-grained approximations on the
corresponding smooth commutative geometry. We find that this motivates a
redefinition of the matrix variables, involving possible ``counterterms'' to
the noncommutative algebra, similar in spirit to usual renormalization in field
theory. We then apply these techniques to more general noncommutative
geometries and find that blocking up averages over far-off-diagonal matrix
elements and brings them in, towards the diagonal. We find constraints on the
noncommuting scalar matrices defining the geometry for moving towards a
commutative limit. Further, we show that blocking up does not appear to exhibit
any ``chaotic'' behaviour, suggesting that there is sensible physics underlying
such a matrix renormalization. We discuss briefly interrelations of these ideas
with B-fields and noncommutativity in this preliminary paper.
