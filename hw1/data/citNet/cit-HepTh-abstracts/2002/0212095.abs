  We consider the exact effective superpotential of N=1 U(N_c) super Yang-Mills
theory with N_f massive flavors an additional adjoint Higgs field. We use the
proposal of Dijkgraaf and Vafa to calculate the superpotential in terms of a
matrix model with a large number of flavors. We do this by gauging the flavor
symmetry and forcing this sector in a classical vacuum. This gives rise to a
2-matrix model of ADE type A_2, and large flavors. This approach allows us to
add an arbitrary polynomial tree level superpotential for the Higgs field, and
use strict large N methods in the matrix model.
