  We present a model of interacting quantum fields, formulated in a
non-perturbative manner. One of the fields is treated semi-classically, the
other is the photon field. The model has an interpretation of an
electromagnetic field in a fluctuating spacetime.
  The model is equivalent with the quantization of electromagnetism proposed
recently by Czachor. Interesting features are that standard photon theory is
recovered as a limiting case, and that localized field operators for the
electromagnetic field exist as unbounded operators in Hilbert space.
