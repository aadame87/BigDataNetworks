  We investigate orientifolds of type II string theory on K3 and Calabi-Yau
3-folds with intersecting D-branes wrapping special Lagrangian cycles. We
determine quite generically the chiral massless spectrum in terms of
topological invariants and discuss both orbifold examples and algebraic
realizations in detail. Intriguingly, the developed techniques provide an
elegant way to figure out the chiral sector of orientifold models without
computing any explicit string partition function. As a new example we derive a
non-supersymmetric Standard-like Model from an orientifold of type IIA on the
quintic Calabi-Yau 3-fold with wrapped D6-branes. In the case of supersymmetric
intersecting brane models on Calabi-Yau manifolds we discuss the D-term and
F-term potentials, the effective gauge couplings and the Green-Schwarz
mechanism. The mirror symmetric formulation of this construction is provided
within type IIB theory. We finally include a short discussion about the lift of
these models from type IIB on K3 to F-theory and from type IIA on Calabi-Yau
3-folds to M-theory on G_2 manifolds.
