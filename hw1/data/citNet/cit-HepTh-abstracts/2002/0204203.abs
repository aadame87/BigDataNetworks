  Using D-brane effective field theories, we study dynamical decay of unstable
brane systems : (i) a parallel brane-antibrane pair with separation l and (ii)
a dielectric brane. In particular we give explicitly the decay width of these
unstable systems, and describe how the decay proceeds after the tunnel effect.
The decay (i) is analysed by the use of a tachyon effective action on the
Dp-Dpbar. A pair annihilation starts by nucleation of a bubble of a tachyon
domain wall which represents a throat connecting these branes, and the
tunneling decay width is found to be proportional to exp(-l^{p+1} T_{Dp}). We
study also the decay leaving topological defects corresponding to
lower-dimensional branes, which may be relevant for recent inflationary
braneworld scenario. As for the decay (ii), first we observe that Dp-branes
generically ``curl up'' in a nontrivial RR field strength. Using this
viewpoint, we compute the decay width of the dielectric D2-branes by
constructing relevant Euclidean bounce solutions in the shape of a funnel. We
also give new solutions in doughnut shape which are involved with nucleation of
dielectric branes from nothing.
