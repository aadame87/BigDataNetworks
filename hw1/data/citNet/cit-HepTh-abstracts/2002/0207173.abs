  We investigate the dynamics of a spherically symmetric vaccum on a Randall
and Sundrum 3-brane world. Under certain natural conditions, the effective
Einstein equations on the brane form a closed system for spherically symmetric
dark radiation. We determine exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions, which
are shown to depend on the brane cosmological constant, on the dark radiation
tidal charge and on its initial energy configuration. We identify the
conditions defining these solutions as singular or as globally regular.
Finally, we discuss the confinement of gravity to the vicinity of the brane and
show that a phase transition to a regime where gravity is not bound to the
brane may occur at short distances during the collapse of positive dark energy
density on a realistic de Sitter brane.
