  A class of spectral problems with a hidden Lie-algebraic structure is
considered. We define a duality transformation which maps the spectrum of one
quasi-exactly solvable (QES) periodic potential to that of another QES periodic
potential. The self-dual point of this transformation corresponds to the
energy-reflection symmetry found previously for certain QES systems. The
duality transformation interchanges bands at the bottom (top) of the spectrum
of one potential with gaps at the top (bottom) of the spectrum of the other,
dual, potential. Thus, the duality transformation provides an exact mapping
between the weak coupling (perturbative) and semiclassical (nonperturbative)
sectors.
