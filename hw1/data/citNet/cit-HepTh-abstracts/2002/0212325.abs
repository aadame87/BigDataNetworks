  In a recent paper [1] a new generalization of Killing motion, the {\it gauged
motion}, has been introduced for stationary spacetimes where it was shown that
the physical symmetries of such spacetimes are well described through this new
symmetry. In this article after a more detailed study in stationary case we
present the definition of gauged motion for general spacetimes. The definition
is based on the gauged Lie derivative induced by a threading family of
observers and the relevant reparametrization invariance. We also extend the
gauged motion to the case of Kaluza-Klein theories.
