Title: A construction of G_2 holonomy spaces with torus symmetry
Authors: O.P. Santillan
Comments: Version with 23 pages, no figures, the one form corresponding to the
  3 pole solution are expressed in another way

  In the present work the Calderbank-Pedersen description of four dimensional
manifolds with self-dual Weyl tensor is used to obtain examples of
quaternionic-kahler metrics with two commuting isometries. The eigenfunctions
of the hyperbolic laplacian are found by use of Backglund transformations
acting over solutions of the Ward monopole equation. The Bryant-Salamon
construction of $G_2$ holonomy metrics arising as $R^3$ bundles over
quaternionic-kahler base spaces is applied to this examples to find internal
spaces of the M-theory that leads to an N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions.
Type IIA solutions will be obtained too by reduction along one of the
isometries. The torus symmetry of the base spaces is extended to the total
ones.
