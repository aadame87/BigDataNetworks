  We consider world-volume description of M2-branes ending on an M5-brane. The
system can be described either as a solitonic solution of the M5-brane field
equations or in terms of an effective string propagating in 6-dimensions. We
show that the zeroth order scalar scattering amplitudes behave similarly in
both pictures. The soliton solution appears to have a horizon-like throat
region. Due to the underlying geometric structure of the M5-brane theory, modes
propagating near the horizon are subject to a large red-shift. This allows one
to define a decoupling limit and implies a holographic duality between two
theories which do not contain dynamical gravity.
