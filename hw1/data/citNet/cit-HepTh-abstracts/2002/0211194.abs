  We give a recipe relating holomorphic quantities in supersymmetric field
theory to their descendants in non-supersymmetric Z_2 orbifold field theories.
This recipe, consistent with a recent proposal of Strassler, gives exact
results for bifermion condensates, domain wall tensions and gauge coupling
constants in the planar limit of the orbifold theories.
