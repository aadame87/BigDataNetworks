Title: Poincare algebra and space-time critical dimensions for parabosonic
  strings
Authors: N. Belaloui and H. Bennacer
Comments: Latex,16 pages
\\
  We construct the parabosonic string formalism based on the paraquantization
of both the center of mass variables and the excitation modes of the string. A
critical study of the different commutators of the Poincar\'{e} algebra based
on the redefinition of its generators and the direct treatment using trilinear
relations is done. Space-time critical dimensions $D$ as functions of the
paraquantization order $Q$ are obtained.
