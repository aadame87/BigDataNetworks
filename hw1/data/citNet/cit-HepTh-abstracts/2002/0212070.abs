  The local cohomology of an extended BRST differential which includes global
N=1 supersymmetry and Poincare transformations is completely and explicitly
computed in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with
super-Yang-Mills multiplets, chiral matter multiplets and linear multiplets
containing 2-form gauge potentials. In particular we determine to first order
all N=1 supersymmetric and Poincare invariant consistent deformations of these
theories that preserve the N=1 supersymmetry algebra on-shell modulo gauge
transformations, and all Poincare invariant candidate gauge and supersymmetry
anomalies. When the Yang-Mills gauge group is semisimple and no linear
multiplets are present, we find that all such deformations can be constructed
from standard superspace integrals and preserve the supersymmetry
transformations in a formulation with auxiliary fields, and the candidate
anomalies are exhausted by supersymmetric generalizations of the well-known
chiral anomalies. In the general case there are additional deformations and
candidate anomalies which are relevant especially to the deformation of free
theories and the general classification of interaction terms in supersymmetric
field theories.
