Title: Contraints on matter from asymptotic safety

  Recent studies of the ultraviolet behaviour of pure gravity suggest that it
admits a non-Gaussian attractive fixed point, and therefore that the theory is
asymptotically safe. We consider the effect on this fixed point of massless
minimally coupled matter fields. The existence of a UV attractive fixed point
puts bounds on the type and number of such fields.
