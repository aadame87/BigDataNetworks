  The consequences for the brane cosmological evolution of energy exchange
between the brane and the bulk are analysed in detail, in the context of a
non-factorizable background geometry with vanishing effective cosmological
constant on the brane. A rich variety of brane cosmologies is obtained,
depending on the precise mechanism of energy transfer, the equation of state of
brane-matter and the spatial topology. An accelerating era is generically a
feature of our solutions. In the case of low-density flat universe more dark
matter than in the conventional FRW picture is predicted. Spatially compact
solutions are found to delay their recollapse.
