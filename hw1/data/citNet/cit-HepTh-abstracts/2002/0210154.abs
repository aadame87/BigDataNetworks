  We use ideas on integrability in higher dimensions to define Lorentz
invariant field theories with an infinite number of local conserved currents.
The models considered have a two dimensional target space. Requiring the
existence of Lagrangean and the stability of static solutions singles out a
class of models which have an additional conformal symmetry. That is used to
explain the existence of an ansatz leading to solutions with non trivial Hopf
charges.
