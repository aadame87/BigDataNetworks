  Local decompositions of a Dirac spinor into `charged' and `real' pieces
psi(x) = M(x) chi(x) are considered. chi(x) is a Majorana spinor, and M(x) a
suitable Dirac-algebra valued field. Specific examples of the decomposition in
2+1 dimensions are developed, along with kinematical implications, and
constraints on the component fields within M(x) sufficient to encompass the
correct degree of freedom count. Overall local reparametrisation and
electromagnetic phase invariances are identified, and a dynamical framework of
nonabelian gauge theories of noncompact groups is proposed. Connections with
supersymmetric composite models are noted (including, for 2+1 dimensions,
infrared effective theories of spin-charge separation in models of high-Tc
superconductivity).
