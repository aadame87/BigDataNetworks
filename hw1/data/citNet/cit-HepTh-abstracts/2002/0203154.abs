  We study a five-dimensional field theory which contains a monopole (string)
solution with chiral fermion zero modes. This monostring solution is a close
analog of the fivebrane solution of M-theory. The cancellation of normal bundle
anomalies parallels that for the M-theory fivebrane, in particular, the
presence of a Chern-Simons term in the low-energy effective U(1) gauge theory
plays a central role. We comment on the relationship between the the
microscopic analysis of the world-volume theory and the low-energy analysis and
draw some cautionary lessons for M-theory.
