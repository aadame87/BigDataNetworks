  We consider Einstein gravity coupled to a CFT made of a single free conformal
scalar in 4-d Anti de Sitter space. This simple case is rich enough to explain
an unexpected gravitational Higgs phenomenon that has no flat-space
counterpart, yet simple enough that many calculations can be carried on
exactly. Specifically, in this paper we compute the graviton self energy due to
matter, and we exhibit its spectral representation. This enables us to find the
spin-2 bound-state content of the system.
