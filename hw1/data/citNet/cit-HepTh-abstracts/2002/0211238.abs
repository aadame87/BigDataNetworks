Title: MSFT : Moyal Star Formulation of String Field Theory
Authors: Itzhak Bars
Comments: 22 pages, LaTeX. v2 minor corrections
\\
  The Moyal star formulation of string field theory is reviewed. The various
versions of the star product are compared and related to one another in a
regulated theory that resolves associativity anomalies. A summary of
computations and challenges is given.
