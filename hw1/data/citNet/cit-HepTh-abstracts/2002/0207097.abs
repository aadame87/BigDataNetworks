  It is known that the physics of open strings on a D2-brane on a two-torus is
realized from the viewpoint of deformation quantization in the Seiberg-Witten
limit. We study its T-dual theory, i.e. D1-brane physics on two-tori. Such
theory is described by Kronecker foliation. The algebra of open strings on the
D1-brane is then identified with the crossed product representation of a
noncommutative two-torus. The Morita equivalence of noncommutative two-tori is
also realized geometrically along this line. As an application, Heisenberg
modules and the tensor product between them are discussed from these geometric
viewpoints. We show they are related to the homological mirror symmetry of
two-tori.
