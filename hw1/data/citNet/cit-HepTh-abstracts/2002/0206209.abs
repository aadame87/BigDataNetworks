  In this paper we construct explicit Lagrangian formulation for the massive
spin-2 supermultiplets with N = k supersymmetries k = 1,2,3,4. Such multiplets
contain 2k particles with spin-3/2, so there must exist N = 2k local
supersymmetries in the full nonlinear theories spontaneously broken so that
only N = k global supersymmetries remain unbroken. In this paper we unhide
these hidden supersymmetries by using gauge invariant formulation for massive
high spin particles. Such formulation, operating with the right set of physical
degrees of freedom from the very beginning and having non-singular massless
limit, turns out to be very well suited for construction of massive
supermultiplets from the well known massless ones. For all four cases
considered we have managed to show that the massless limit of the
supertransformations for N = k massive supermultiplet could be uplifted to N =
2k supersymmetry. This, in turn, allows one to investigate which extended
supergravity models such massive multiplets could arise from. Our results show
a clear connection of possible models with the five-dimensional extended
supergravities.
