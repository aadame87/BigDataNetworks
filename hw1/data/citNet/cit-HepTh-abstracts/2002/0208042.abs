  We present several supergravity solutions corresponding to both Dp, as well
as Dp-Dp' systems, in NS-NS and R-R PP-wave background originating from AdS_3
times S^3 times R^4. The Dp brane solutions, p=1,..,5 are fully localized,
whereas Dp-Dp' are localized along common transverse directions. We also
discuss the supersymmetry properties of these solutions and the worldsheet
construction for the p-p' system.
