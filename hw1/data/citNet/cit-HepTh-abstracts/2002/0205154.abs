  Classical BRST invariance in the pure spinor formalism for the open
superstring is shown to imply the supersymmetric Born-Infeld equations of
motion for the background fields. These equations are obtained by requiring
that the left and right-moving BRST currents are equal on the worldsheet
boundary in the presence of the background. The Born-Infeld equations are
expressed in N=1 D=10 superspace and include all abelian contributions to the
low-energy equations of motion, as well as the leading non-abelian
contributions.
