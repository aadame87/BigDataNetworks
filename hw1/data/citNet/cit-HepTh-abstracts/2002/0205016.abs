  We use the correspondence between scalar field theory on AdS and induced
conformal field theory on its boundary to calculate correlation functions of
logarithmic conformal field theory in arbitrary dimensions.Our calculations
utilize the newly proposed method of nilpotent weights.We derive expressions
for the four point function assuming a generic interaction term
