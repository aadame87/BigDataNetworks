  Direct evaluation of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential is accomplished
following the localization programme suggested some time ago. Our results agree
with all low-instanton calculations available in the literature. We present a
two-parameter generalization of the Seiberg-Witten prepotential, which is
rather natural from the M-theory/five dimensional perspective, and conjecture
its relation to the tau-functions of KP/Toda hierarchy.
