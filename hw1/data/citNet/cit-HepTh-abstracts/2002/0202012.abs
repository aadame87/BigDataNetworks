  N=2 SQED with several flavors admits multiple, static BPS domain wall
solutions. We determine the explicit two-kink metric and examine the dynamics
of colliding domain walls. The multi-kink metric has a toric Kahler structure
and we reduce the Kahler potential to quadrature. In the second part of this
paper, we consider semi-local vortices compactified on circle. We argue that,
in the presence of a suitable Wilson line, the vortices separate into domain
wall constituents. These play the role of fractional instantons in
two-dimensional gauge theories and sigma-models.
