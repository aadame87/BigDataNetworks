  We consider an extension of the gauge-fixing procedure in the framework of
the Lagrangian superfield BRST and BRST-antiBRST quantization schemes for
arbitrary gauge theories, taking into account the possible ambiguity in the
choice of the superfield antibracket. We show that this ambiguity is fixed by
the algebraic properties of the antibracket and the form of the BRST and
antiBRST transformations, realized in terms of superspace translations. The
Ward identities related to the generalized gauge-fixing procedure are obtained.
