  We consider the process of photon decay in quantum electrodynamics with a
CPT-violating Chern-Simons-like term added to the action. For a simplified
model with only the quadratic Maxwell and Chern-Simons-like terms and the
quartic Euler-Heisenberg term, we obtain a nonvanishing probability for the
decay of a particular photon state into three others.
