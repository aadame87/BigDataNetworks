  We combine linear response theory and dimensional regularization in order to
derive the dynamical Casimir force in the low frequency regime. We consider two
parallel plates moving along the normal direction in $D-$dimensional space. We
assume the free-space values for the mass of each plate to be known, and obtain
finite, separation-dependent mass corrections resulting from the combined
effect of the two plates. The global mass correction is proportional to the
static Casimir energy, in agreement with Einstein's law of equivalence between
mass and energy for stressed rigid bodies.
