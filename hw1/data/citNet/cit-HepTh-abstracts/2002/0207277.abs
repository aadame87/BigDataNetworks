  Based on the physical projector approach, a nonpertubative quantization of
the massless Schwinger model is considered which does not require any gauge
fixing. The spectrum of physical states, readily identified following a
diagonalization of the operator algebra, is that of a massive pseudoscalar
field, namely the electric field having acquired a mass proportional to the
gauge coupling constant. The physical spectrum need not be identified with
confined bound fermion-antifermion pairs, an interpretation which one is
otherwise led to given whatever gauge fixing procedure but which is not void of
gauge fixing artefacts.
