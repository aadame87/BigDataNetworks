  In recent work, it was shown that velocity-dependent forces between parallel
fundamental strings moving apart in a D-dimensional spacetime implied an
expanding universe in D-1-dimensional spacetime. Here we expand on this work to
obtain exact solutions for various string/brane cosmological toy models.
