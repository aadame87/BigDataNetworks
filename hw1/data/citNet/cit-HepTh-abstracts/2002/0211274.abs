  Utilizing the techniques recently developed for N=1 super Yang-Mills theories
by Dijkgraaf, Vafa and collaborators, we derive the linearity principle of
Intriligator, Leigh and Seiberg, for the confinement phase of the theories with
semi-simple gauge groups and matters in a non-chiral representation which
satisfies a further technical assumption.
