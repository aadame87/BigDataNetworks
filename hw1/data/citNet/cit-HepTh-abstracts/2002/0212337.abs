  In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence the general form of a three-form
flux perturbation to the AdS_5 x S^5 solution in the type IIB supergravity
which preserves N=2 supersymmetry is obtained. The arbitrary holomorphic
function appearing in the N=1 case studied by Grana and Polchinski is
restricted to a quadratic function of the coordinates transverse to the
D3-branes.
