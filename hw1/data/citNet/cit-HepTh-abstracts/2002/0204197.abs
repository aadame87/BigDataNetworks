  A simple method to canonically quantize noncommutative field theories is
proposed. As a result, the elementary excitations of a (2n+1)-dimensional
scalar field theory are shown to be bilocal objects living in an
(n+1)-dimensional space-time. Feynman rules for their scattering are derived
canonically. They agree, upon suitable redefinitions, with the rules obtained
via star-product methods. The IR/UV connection is interpreted within this
framework.
