  A field model of two-component fermions is described, the consequences of
which coincide in the main with primary postulates of the standard model. Such
a model can be constructed for 4 generations at the minimum. Peculiarities of
the relative coordinate space, determining in general an internal symmetry
group, are considered. Analogues of the Higgs fields appear in the model
naturally after transition to the Grassmannian extra coordinates.
