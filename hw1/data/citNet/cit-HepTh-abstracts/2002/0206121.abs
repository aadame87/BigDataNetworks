  We have extended the variational perturbative theory based on the back ground
field method to include the optimized expansion of Okopinska and the post
Gaussian effective potential of Stansu and Stevenson. This new method provides
much simpler way to compute the correction terms to the Gausssian effective
action (or potential). We have also proposed a conceptually more appealing
prescription for renormalization of the effective potential of the 4-
dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Although this renormalization prescription
leads to the same mathematical form for the renormalized effective potential as
that of Stansu and Stevenson it does not involve the expansion parameter
($\epsilon$).
