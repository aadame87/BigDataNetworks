Title: A simple mechanical analog of the field theory of tachyon matter
Authors: Sayan Kar
Comments: 2 pages (RevTex4, twocolumn format), references added
\\
  In this brief note we show that the zero dimensional version of the field
theory of tachyon matter proposed by Sen, provides an action integral
formulation for the motion of a particle in the presence of Newtonian gravity
and nonlinear damping (quadratic in velocity).
