  We argue that in the presence of instanton-like singularities, the existence
of cosmological horizons can become frame-dependent, ie. a horizon which
appears in Einstein frame may not appear in string frame. We speculate on the
relation between instanton-like singularities and the formulation of quantum
gravity in de Sitter space.
