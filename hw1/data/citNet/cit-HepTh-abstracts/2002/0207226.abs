  In this paper we examine a certain threebrane solution of type IIB string
theory whose long-wavelength dynamics are those of a supersymmetric gauge
theory in 2+1 continuous and 1 discrete dimension, all of infinite extent.
Low-energy processes in this background are controlled by dimensional
deconstruction, a strict limit in which gravity decouples but the lattice
spacing stays finite. Relating this limit to the near-horizon limit of our
solution we obtain an exact, continuum gravitational dual of a lattice gauge
theory with nonzero lattice spacing. H-flux in the translationally invariant
solution encodes the spatial discreteness of the gauge theory, and we relate
the cutoff on allowed momenta to a giant graviton effect in the bulk.
