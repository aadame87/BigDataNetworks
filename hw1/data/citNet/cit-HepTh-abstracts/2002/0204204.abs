  Incompatible use of units corrected. Changes in numerical results and
  conclusion, namely tachyon driven inflation does not give enough e-foldings

  We analyse of the effective action of the tachyon field on a D-brane, of both
bosonic as well as superstring theory. We find that the non-standard kinetic
term of the tachyon field requires a correction to the Born-Infeld type
Lagrangian. The cosmological significance of the resulting dynamics is
explored. We also examine if the rolling tachyon can provide an effective
cosmological constant and contrast its behaviour with quintessence.
