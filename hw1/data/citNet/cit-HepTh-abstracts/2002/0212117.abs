  We investigate a U(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical system on a 2D
noncommutative space with coordinates generating a generalized deformed
oscillator algebra. The Hamiltonian is taken as a quadratic form in gauge
covariant derivatives obeying the nonlinear Dolan-Grady relations. This
restricts the structure function of the deformed oscillator algebra to a
quadratic polynomial. The cases when the coordinates form the su(2) and sl(2,R)
algebras are investigated in detail. Reducing the Hamiltonian to 1D
finite-difference quasi-exactly solvable operators, we demonstrate partial
algebraization of the spectrum of the corresponding systems on the fuzzy sphere
and noncommutative hyperbolic plane. A completely covariant method based on the
notion of intrinsic algebra is proposed to deal with the spectral problem of
such systems.
