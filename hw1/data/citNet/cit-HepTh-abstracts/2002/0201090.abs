Title: Non-canonical quantization of electromagnetic fields and the meaning of
  $Z_3$
Authors: Marek Czachor
Comments: The formalism is simpler and more general if one quantizes with two
  harmonic oscillators (extension to massive particles is natural). Appropriate
  modifications are introduced, eqs. (86),(87),(93) and many other typos are
  corrected

  Non-canonical quantization is based on certain reducible representations of
canonical commutation relations. Relativistic formalism for electromagnetic
non-canonical quantum fields is introduced. Unitary representations of the
Poincar\'e group at the level of fields and states are explicitly given.
Multi-photon and coherent states are introduced. Statistics of photons in a
coherent state is Poissonian if an appropriately defined thermodynamic limit is
performed. Radiation fields having a correct $S$ matrix are constructed. The
$S$ matrix is given by a non-canonical coherent-state displacement operator, a
fact automatically eliminating the infrared catastrophe. This, together with
earlier results on elimination of vacuum and ultraviolet infinities, suggests
that non-canonical quantization leads to finite field theories. Renormalization
constant $Z_3$ is found as a parameter related to wave functions of
non-canonical vacua.
