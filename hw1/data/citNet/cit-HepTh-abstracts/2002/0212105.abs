  Recently it has been suggested that an increase in the fine structure
constant alpha with time would decrease the entropy of a Reissner-Nordstrom
black hole, thereby violating the second law of thermodynamics. In this note we
point out that, at least for a certain class of charged dilaton black holes
related to string theory, the entropy does not change under adiabatic
variations of alpha and one might expect it to increase for non-adiabatic
changes.
