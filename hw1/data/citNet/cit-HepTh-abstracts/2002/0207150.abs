  We propose a five-dimensional standard model which regards the Higgs field as
a weak boson associated with the fifth dimension. The kinetic term of the Higgs
field is obtained from the fifth components of field strengths defined in five
dimension. The coupling constant of the fermion fields and the Higgs field is
only the weak coupling constant. However, since the vacuum expectation value
depends on the fifth coordinate, we can explain the various mass spectrum of
elementary particles.
