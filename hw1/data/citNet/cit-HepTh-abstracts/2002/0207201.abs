  The bosonic beta-gamma ghost system has long been used in formal
constructions of conformal field theory. It has become important in its own
right in the last few years, as a building block of field theory approaches to
disordered systems, and as a simple representative -- due in part to its
underlying su(2)_{-1/2} structure -- of non-unitary conformal field theories.
We provide in this paper the first complete, physical, analysis of this
beta-gamma system, and uncover a number of striking features. We show in
particular that the spectrum involves an infinite number of fields with
arbitrarily large negative dimensions. These fields have their origin in a
twisted sector of the theory, and have a direct relationship with spectrally
flowed representations in the underlying su(2)_{-1/2} theory. We discuss the
spectral flow in the context of the operator algebra and fusion rules, and
provide a re-interpretation of the modular invariant consistent with the
spectrum.
