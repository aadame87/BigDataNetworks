  We study N=1 super Liouville theory on worldsheets with and without boundary.
Some basic correlation functions on a sphere or a disc are obtained using the
properties of degenerate representations of superconformal algebra. Boundary
states are classified by using the modular transformation property of annulus
partition functions, but there are some of those whose wave functions cannot be
obtained from the analysis of modular property. There are two ways of putting
boundary condition on supercurrent, and it turns out that the two choices lead
to different boundary states in quality. Some properties of boundary vertex
operators are also presented. The boundary degenerate operators are shown to
connect two boundary states in a way slightly complicated than the bosonic
case.
