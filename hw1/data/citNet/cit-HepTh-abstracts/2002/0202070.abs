  It is generally known that linear (free) field theories are one of the few
QFT that are exactly soluble. There are, however, (at least) two very different
languages to describe them, Fock space methods and the Schrodinger functional
description. In this paper, the precise sense in which the two representations
are related is explored. The well known fact that the usual Fock representation
is described by a Gaussian measure in the functional picture is proved in an
explicit fashion, starting `from scratch', for a real scalar field theory on
Minkowski spacetime but for arbitrary, non-inertial embeddings of the Cauchy
surface.
