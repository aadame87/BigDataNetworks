Title: Playing with Black Strings
Authors: Gary T. Horowitz
Comments: 21 pages, contribution to Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday conference
\\
  We review recent work showing that there exists a large class of new stable
black strings which are not translationally invariant. Both neutral and charged
black strings are considered. The discussion includes known properties of these
new solutions, attempts to find them explicitly, and a list of open questions.
