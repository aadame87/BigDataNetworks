  We study the braneworld effective action in the two-brane Randall-Sundrum
model. In the framework of this essentially-nonlocal action we reveal the
origin of an infinite sequence of gravitational wave modes - the usual massless
one as well as the tower of Kaluza-Klein massive ones. Mixing of the modes can
be interpreted as radion-induced gravitational-wave oscillations, a classical
analogy to meson and neutrino oscillations. We show that these oscillations
arising in M-theory-inspired braneworld setups could lead to effects detectable
by gravitational-wave interferometers.
