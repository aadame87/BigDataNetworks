  We show that the high temperature limit of the noncommutative thermal
Yang-Mills theory can be directly obtained from the Boltzmann transport
equation of classical particles. As an illustration of the simplicity of the
Boltzmann method, we evaluate the two and the three-point gluon functions in
the noncommutative U(N) theory at high temperatures T. These amplitudes are
gauge invariant and satisfy simple Ward identities. Using the constraint
satisfied at order T^2 by the covariantly conserved current, we construct the
hard thermal loop effective action of the noncommutative theory.
