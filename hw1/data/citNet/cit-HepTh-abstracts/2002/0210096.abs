  The phase structure of the finite SU(2)xSU(2) theory with N=2 supersymmetry,
broken to N=1 by mass terms for the adjoint-valued chiral multiplets, is
determined exactly by compactifying the theory on a circle of finite radius.
The exact low-energy superpotential is constructed by identifying it as a
linear combination of the Hamiltonians of a certain symplectic reduction of the
spin generalized elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable system. It is shown that
the theory has four confining, two Higgs and two massless Coulomb vacua which
agrees with a simple analysis of the tree-level superpotential of the
four-dimensional theory. In each vacuum, we calculate all the condensates of
the adjoint-valued scalars.
