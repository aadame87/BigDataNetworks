  We consider the plane wave limit of the nonspherical giant gravitons. We
compute the Poisson brackets of the coordinate functions and find a nonlinear
algebra. We show that this algebra solves the supersymmetry conditions of the
matrix model. This is the generalization of the algebraic realization of the
spherical membrane as the ``fuzzy sphere''. We describe finite dimensional
representations of the algebra corresponding to the fuzzy torus.
