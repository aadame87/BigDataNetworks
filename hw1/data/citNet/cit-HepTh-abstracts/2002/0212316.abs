  Based on a novel first class algebra, we develop an extension of the pure
spinor (PS) formalism of Berkovits, in which the PS constraints are removed. By
using the homological perturbation theory in an essential way, the BRST-like
charge $Q$ of the conventional PS formalism is promoted to a bona fide
nilpotent charge $\hat{Q}$, the cohomology of which is equivalent to the
constrained cohomology of $Q$. This construction requires only a minimum number
(five) of additional fermionic ghost-antighost pairs and the vertex operators
for the massless modes of open string are obtained in a systematic way.
Furthermore, we present a simple composite "$b$-ghost" field $B(z)$ which
realizes the important relation $T(z) = \{\hat{Q}, B(z)\} $, with $T(z)$ the
Virasoro operator, and apply it to facilitate the construction of the
integrated vertex. The present formalism utilizes U(5) parametrization and the
manifest Lorentz covariance is yet to be achieved.
