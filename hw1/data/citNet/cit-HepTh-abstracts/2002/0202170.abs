  We study the phase structure of nonlocal two dimensional generalized Yang -
Mills theories (nlgYM$_2$) and it is shown that all order of $\phi^{2k}$ model
of these theories has phase transition only on compact manifold with $g = 0$(on
sphere), and the order of phase transition is 3. Also it is shown that the
$\phi^2 + \frac{2\alpha}{3}\phi^3$ model of nlgYM$_2$ has third order phase
transition on any compact manifold with $1 < g < 1+ \frac{\hat{A}}{|\eta_c|}$,
and has no phase transition on sphere.
