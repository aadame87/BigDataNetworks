  We argue that recently proposed by Amelino-Camelia et all [1,2] so-called
doubly special relativity (DSR), with deformed boost transformations identical
with the formulae for $\kappa$-deformed kinematics in bicrossproduct basis is a
classical special relativity in nonlinear disguise. The choice of symmetric
composition law for deformed fourmomenta as advocated in [1, 2] implies that
DSR is obtained by considering nonlinear fourmomenta basis of classical
Poincar\'{e} algebra and it does not lead to noncommutative space-time. We also
show how to construct large two classes of doubly special relativity theories -
generalizing the choice in [1,2] and the one presented by Magueijo and Smolin
[3]. The older version of deformed relativistic kinematics, differing
essentially from classical theory in the coalgebra sector and leading to
noncommutative $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space is provided by quantum
$\kappa$-deformation of Poincar\'e symmetries.
