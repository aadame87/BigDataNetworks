  The general properties of the abelian projection are reviewed. We derive the
explicit expression for the abelian functional integral for U(1) abelian theory
which corresponds to the abelian projection of the SU(2) gluodynamics. The
numerical results for the temperature dependence of the monopole condensate are
presented.
