  The string field theory for unoriented open-closed string mixed system is
constructed up to quadratic order based on the joining-splitting type vertices.
The gauge invariance with closed string transformation parameter is proved. The
infinity cancellation mechanism between disk and projective plane amplitudes
plays an essential role for the gauge invariance of the theory.
