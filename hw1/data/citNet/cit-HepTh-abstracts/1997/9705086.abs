  In the paper we give consecutive description of functional methods of quantum
field theory for systems of interacting q-particles. These particles obey
exotic statistics and appear in many problems of condensed matter physics,
magnetism and quantum optics. Motivated by the general ideas of standard field
theory we derive formulae in q-functional derivatives for the partition
function and Green's functions generating functional for systems of exotic
particles. This leads to a corresponding perturbation series and a diagram
technique. Results are illustrated by a consideration of an one-dimensional
q-particle system and compared with some exact expressions obtained earlier.
