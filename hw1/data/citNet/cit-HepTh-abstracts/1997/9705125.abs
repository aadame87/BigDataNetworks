Title: On The Planar Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: Djordje Minic
Comments: 11 pages, TeX
\\
  The planar Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions is examined in a
particular representation which explicitly embodies factorization. The
effective planar Yang-Mills theory Hamiltonian is constructed in this
representation.
