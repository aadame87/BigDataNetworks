  We show how to extend the standard functional approach to bosonisation, based
on a decoupling change of path-integral variables, to the case in which a
finite temperature is considered. As examples, in order to both illustrate and
check the procedure, we derive the thermodynamical partition functions for the
Thirring and Schwinger models.
