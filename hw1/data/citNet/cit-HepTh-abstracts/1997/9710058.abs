  The effects of boundary conditions of the fields for the compactified space
directions on the supersymmetric theories are discussed. The boundary
conditions can be taken to be periodic up to the degrees of freedom of
localized $U(1)_{R}$ transformations. The boundary condition breaks the
supersymmery to yield universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms. The
4-dimensional supersymmetric QED with one flavour and the pure supersymmetric
QCD are studied as toy models when one of the space coordinates is compactified
on $S^1$.
