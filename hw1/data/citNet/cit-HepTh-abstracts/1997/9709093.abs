  Dilaton stabilization may occur in a theory based on a single asymptotically
free gauge group with matter due to an interplay between quantum modification
of the moduli space and tree-level superpotential. We present a toy model where
such a mechanism is realized. Dilaton stabilization in this mechanism tends to
occur at strong coupling values unless some unnatural adjustment of parameters
is involved.
