  The set of string vertices is extended to include moduli spaces with genus
and numbers of ordinary and special punctures ranging over all integral values
$g,n,\bar n\geq0$. It is argued that both the string background and the B-V
delta operator should be associated with the vertex $\B^0_{0,1}$ corresponding
to the once-punctured sphere. This leads naturally to the proposal that the
manifestly background independent formulation of quantum closed string field
theory is given by the sum $\B$ of the completed set of string vertices
satisfying the classical master equation $\{\B,\B\}=0$.
