  In order to study the discrepancy between the supersymmetry bound and the
extremality bound for rotating black holes, the effect of duality
transformations on the class of stationary and axially symmetric string
backgrounds, called the TNbh, is considerd. It is shown that the Bogomolnyi
bound is invariant under those duality transformations that transform the TNbh
into itself, meaning that duality does not constrain the angular momentum in
such a way as to reconcile the aforementioned bounds. A physical reason for the
existence of the discrepancy is given in terms of superradiance.
