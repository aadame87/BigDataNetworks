Title: Three dimensional strings. I. Classical theory
Author: Eduardo Ramos
Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX (elsart macros), I drop a conjecture about the
  quantization of the model that now seems unwarranted. This does not alter the
  results of the paper. A few misprints are also corrected

  I consider a three-dimensional string theory whose action, besides the
standard area term, contains one of the form $\int_{\Sigma}
\epsilon_{\mu\nu\sigma} X^{\mu} d X^{\nu} \wedge d X^{\sigma}$. In the case of
closed strings this extra term has a simple geometrical interpretation as the
volume enclosed by the surface. The associated variational problem yields as
solutions constant mean curvature surfaces. One may then show the equivalence
of this equation of motion to that of an SU(2) principal chiral model coupled
to gravity. It is also possible by means of the Kemmotsu representation
theorem, restricted to constant curvature surfaces, to map the solution space
of the string model into the one of the $CP^1$ nonlinear sigma model. I also
show how a description of the Gauss map of the surface in terms of SU(2)
spinors allows for yet a different description of this result by means of a
Gross-Neveu spinorial model coupled to 2-D gravity. The standard
three-dimensional string equations can also be recovered by setting the
current-current coupling to zero.
