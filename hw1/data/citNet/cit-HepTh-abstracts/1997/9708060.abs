  In a wide class of supersymmetric theories degenerate families of the
BPS-saturated domain walls exist. The internal structure of these walls can
continuously vary, without changing the wall tension. This is described by
hidden parameters (collective coordinates). Differentiating with respect to the
collective coordinates one gets a set of the bosonic zero modes localized on
the wall. Neither of them is related to the spontaneous breaking of any
symmetry. Through the residual 1/2 of supersymmetry each bosonic zero mode
generates a fermionic partner.
