\\
  Yang-Mills theory in the first order formalism appears as the deformation of
a topological field theory, the pure BF theory. We discuss this formulation at
the quantum level, giving the Feynman rules of the BF-YM theory, the structure
of the renormalization and checking its uv-behaviour in the computation of the
beta-function which agrees with the expected result.
