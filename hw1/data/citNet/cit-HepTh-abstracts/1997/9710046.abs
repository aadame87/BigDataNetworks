  We review various aspects of classical solutions in string theories. Emphasis
is placed on their supersymmetry properties, their special roles in string
dualities and microscopic interpretations. Topics include black hole solutions
in string theories on tori and N=2 supergravity theories; p-branes; microscopic
interpretation of black hole entropy. We also review aspects of dualities and
BPS states.
