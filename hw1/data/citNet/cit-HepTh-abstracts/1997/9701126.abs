  Explicit open single and multi-membrane solutions of the low energy limit of
M-theory on the orbifold $R^{10}\times S^1/Z_2$ are presented. This low energy
action is described by an 11-dimensional supergravity action coupled to two
$E_8$ super Yang-Mills fields, which propagate only on the 10-dimensional
boundaries of the target space. The membrane solutions we construct preserve
half the supersymmetries. They carry electric charge and current with respect
to the gauge fields, whose generators are in the Cartan subalgebra of the two
$E_8$ gauge groups present at the boundaries.
