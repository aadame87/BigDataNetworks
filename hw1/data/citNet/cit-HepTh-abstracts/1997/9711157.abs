  We search for dual gauge theories of all-loop finite, N = 1 supersymmetric
gauge theories. It is shown how to find explicitly the dual gauge theories of
almost all chiral, N = 1, all-loop finite gauge theories, while several models
have been discussed in detail, including a realistic finite SU(5) unified
theory. Out of our search only one all-loop, N = 1 finite SO(10) theory
emerges, so far, as a candidate for exhibiting also S-duality.
