  The scattering of NS-NS antisymmetric tensor states in the presence of
D-instantons in type IIB superstring theory is studied. It is shown that in
order to preserve gauge invariance, spacetime supersymmetry and picture
changing symmetry the inclusion of boundary contact terms for closed string
antisymmetric tensor vertex operators is necessary.
