  We analyze the low energy behavior of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with
SU(N_c) x SU(N_c) gauge group and a Landau-Ginzburg type superpotential. These
theories contain fundamentals transforming under one of the gauge groups as
well as bifundamental matter which transforms as a fundamentals under each. We
obtain the parametrization of the gauge coupling on the Coulomb branch in terms
of a hyperelliptic curve. The derivation of this curve involves making use of
Seiberg's duality for SQCD as well as the classical constraints for N_f=N_c+1
and the quantum modified constraints for N_f=N_c.
