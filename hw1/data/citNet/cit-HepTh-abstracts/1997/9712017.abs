  We consider BPS configurations in theories with two timelike directions from
the perspective of the supersymmetry algebra. We show that whereas a BPS state
in a theory with one timelike variable must have positive energy, in a theory
with two times any BPS state must have positive angular momentum in the
timelike plane, in that $Z_{0\tilde{0}}>0$, where $0$ and $\tilde{0}$ are the
two timelike directions. We consider some generic BPS solutions of theories
with two timelike directions, and then specialise to the study of the (10,2)
dimensional superalgebra for which the spinor operators generate 2-forms and
6-forms. We argue that the BPS configurations of this algebra relate to
F-theory in the same way that the BPS configurations of the eleven dimensional
supersymmetry algebra relate to M-theory. We show that the twelve dimensional
theory is one of fundamental 3-branes and 7-branes, along with their dual
partners. We then formulate the new intersection rules for these objects. Upon
reduction of this system we find the algebraic description of the IIB-branes
and the M-branes. Given these correspondences we may begin an algebraic study
of F-theory.
