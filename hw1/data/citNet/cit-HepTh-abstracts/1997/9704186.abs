  We present four-dimensional M-theory vacua with N>0 supersymmetry which, from
the perspective of perturbative Type IIA string theory, have N=0. Such vacua
can appear when the compactifying 7-manifold is a U(1) fibration. The missing
superpartners are Dirichlet 0-branes. Someone unable to detect Ramond-Ramond
charge would thus conclude that these worlds have no unbroken supersymmetry. In
particular, the gravitinos (and also some of the gauge bosons) are 0-branes not
seen in perturbation theory but which curiously remain massless however weak
the string coupling.
