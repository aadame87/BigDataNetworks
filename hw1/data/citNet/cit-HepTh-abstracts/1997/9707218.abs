  It is shown, by using Grassmann space to describe the internal degrees of
freedom of fermions and bosons, that the Weyl like equation exists not only for
massless fermions but also for massless gauge bosons. The corresponding states
have well defined helicity and handedness. It is shown that spinors and gauge
bosons of the same handedness only interact.
