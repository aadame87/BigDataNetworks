  We calculate the effective potential of the scalar theory at finite
temperature under the super-daisy approximation, after expressing its
derivative with respect to mass square in terms of the full propagator. This
expression becomes the self-consistent equation for the derivative of the
effective potential. We find the phase transition is first order with this
approximation. We compare our result with others.
