Title: Variational Approach to Quantum Field Theory: Gaussian Approximation and
  the Perturbative Expansion around It
Authors: Jae Hyung Yee (Yonsei Univ.)
Comments: To appear in the proceedings of APCTP-ICTP Joint International
  Conference '97 on "Recent Developments in Nonperturbative Quantum Field
  Theory". new references are added
\\
  The functional Schrodinger picture formulation of quantum field theory and
the variational Gaussian approximation method based on the formulation are
briefly reviewed. After presenting recent attempts to improve the variational
approximation, we introduce a new systematic method based on the background
field method, which enables one to compute the order-by-order correction terms
to the Gaussian approximation of the effective action.
