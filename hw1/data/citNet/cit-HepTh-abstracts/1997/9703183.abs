  We present a new geometrical approach to superstrings based on the
geometrical theory of integration on supermanifolds. This approach provides an
effective way to calculate multi-loop superstring amplitudes for arbitrary
backgrounds. It makes possible to calculate amplitudes for the physical states
defined as BRST cohomology classes using arbitrary representatives. Since the
new formalism does not rely on the presence of primary representatives for the
physical states it is particulary valuable for analyzing the discrete states
for which no primary representatives are available. We show that the discrete
states provide information about symmetries of the background including odd
symmetries which mix Bose and Fermi states. The dilaton is an example of a
non-discrete state which cannot be covariantly represented by a primary vertex.
The new formalism allows to prove the dilaton theorem by a direct calculation.
