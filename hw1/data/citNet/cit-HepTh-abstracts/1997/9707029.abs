  We apply the principles discussed in earlier papers to the construction of
discrete time quantum field theories. We use the Schwinger action principle to
find the discrete time free field commutators for scalar fields, which allows
us to set up the reduction formalism for discrete time scattering processes.
Then we derive the discrete time analogue of the Feynman rules for a scalar
field with a cubic self interaction and give examples of discrete time
scattering amplitude calculations. We find overall conservation of total linear
momentum and overall conservation of total theta parameters, which is the
discrete time analogue of energy conservation and corresponds to the existence
of a Logan invariant for the system. We find that temporal discretisation leads
to softened vertex factors, modifies propagators and gives a natural cutoff for
physical particle momenta.
