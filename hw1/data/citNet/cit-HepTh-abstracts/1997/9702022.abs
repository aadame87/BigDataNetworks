  Using the Schwinger-Keldysh technique we discuss how to derive the transport
equations for the system of massless quantum fields. We analyse the scalar
field models with quartic and cubic interaction terms. In the $\phi^4$ model
the massive quasiparticles appear due to the self-interaction of massless bare
fields. Therefore, the derivation of the transport equations strongly resembles
that one of the massive fields, but the subset of diagrams which provide the
quasiparticle mass has to be resummed. The kinetic equation for the finite
width quasiparticles is found, where, except the mean-field and collision
terms, there are terms which are absent in the standard Boltzmann equation. The
structure of these terms is discussed. In the massless $\phi^3$ model the
massive quasiparticles do not emerge and presumably there is no transport
theory corresponding to this model. It is not surprising since the $\phi^3$
model is anyhow ill defined.
