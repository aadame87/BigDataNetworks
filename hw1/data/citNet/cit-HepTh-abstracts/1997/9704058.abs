  It is shown that there are large static black holes for which all curvature
invariants are small near the event horizon, yet any object which falls in
experiences enormous tidal forces outside the horizon. These black holes are
charged and near extremality, and exist in a wide class of theories including
string theory. The implications for cosmic censorship and the black hole
information puzzle are discussed.
