  A direct link between a one-loop N-point Feynman diagram and a geometrical
representation based on the N-dimensional simplex is established by relating
the Feynman parametric representations to the integrals over contents of
(N-1)-dimensional simplices in non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature. In
particular, the four-point function in four dimensions is proportional to the
volume of a three-dimensional spherical (or hyperbolic) tetrahedron which can
be calculated by splitting into birectangular ones. It is also shown that the
known formula of reduction of the N-point function in (N-1) dimensions
corresponds to splitting the related N-dimensional simplex into N rectangular
ones.
