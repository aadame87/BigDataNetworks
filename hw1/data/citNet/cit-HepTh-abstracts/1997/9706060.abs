Title: Topologically Massive Models from Higgs Mechanism
Authors: A. De Castro and A. Restuccia
Comments: 12 pages, latex, no figures
\\
  A new variational principle allowing the implementation of the Higgs
mechanism for abelian theories over non-trivial background flat connections is
proposed. It is found that the mass generated for the spin 1 excitation is the
same as the one obtained from the standard Higgs mechanism over trivial
backgrounds, however, the dynamical structure of the action for the Higgs
scalar is completely different from the usual approach. There is a topological
contribution to the mass term of the Higgs field. After functional integration
over all backgrounds, it is shown that the action for the massive spin 1
excitation is dual to the Topologically Massive Models in any dimension.
