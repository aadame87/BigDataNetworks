Title: On n-point correlations in the log-gas at rational temperature
Authors: Andrei Okounkov

\\
  We obtain a Ha type formula for n-point correlations in the log-gas at
rational temperature (or, equivalently, n-point one-time ground state
correlations in the quantum Calogero-Sutherland model for rational coupling
constant).
