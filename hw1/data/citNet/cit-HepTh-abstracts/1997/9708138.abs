  The existence of topological invariants analogous to Chern/Pontryagin classes
for a standard $SO(D)$ or $SU(N)$ connection, but constructed out of the
torsion tensor, is discussed. These invariants exhibit many of the features of
the Chern/Pontryagin invariants: they can be expressed as integrals over the
manifold of local densities and take integer values on compact spaces without
boundary; their spectrum is determined by the homotopy groups
$\pi_{D-1}(SO(D))$ and $\pi_{D-1}(SO(D+1))$.
  These invariants are not solely determined by the connection bundle but
depend also on the bundle of local orthonormal frames on the tangent space of
the manifold. It is shown that in spacetimes with nonvanishing torsion there
can occur topologically stable configurations associated with the frame bundle
which are independent of the curvature.
  Explicit examples of topologically stable configurations carrying
nonvanishing instanton number in four and eight dimensions are given, and they
can be conjectured to exist in dimension $4k$. It is also shown that the chiral
anomaly in a spacetime with torsion receives a contribution proportional to
this instanton number and hence, chiral theories in $4k$-dimensional spacetimes
with torsion are potentially anomalous.
