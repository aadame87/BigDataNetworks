  Quantum mechanical operators and quantum fields are interpreted as
realizations of timespace manifolds. Such causal manifolds are parametrized by
the classes of the positive unitary operations in all complex operations, i.e.
by the homogenous spaces $\D(n)=\GL(\C^n_\R)/\U(n)$ with $n=1$ for mechanics
and $n=2$ for relativistic fields. The rank $n$ gives the number of both the
discrete and continuous invariants used in the harmonic analysis, i.e. two
characteristic masses in the relativistic case. 'Canonical' field theories with
the familiar divergencies are inappropriate realizations of the real
4-dimensional causal manifold $\D(2)$. Faithful timespace realizations do not
lead to divergencies. In general they are reducible, but nondecomposable - in
addition to representations with eigenvectors (states, particle) they
incorporate principal vectors without a particle (eigenvector) basis as
exemplified by the Coulomb field.
