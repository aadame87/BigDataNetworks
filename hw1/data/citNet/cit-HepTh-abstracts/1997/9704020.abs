  We analyze the chiral symmetries of flavored quantum chromodynamics in two
dimensions and show the existence of chiral condensates within the
path-integral approach. The massless and massive cases are discussed as well,
for arbitrary finite and infinite number of colors. Our results put forward the
question of topological issues when matter is in the fundamental representation
of the gauge group.
