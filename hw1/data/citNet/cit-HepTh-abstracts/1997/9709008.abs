  In the framework of three dimensional extended supergravity theories, we
demonstrate that there exist non-trivial Killing spinors over BPS soliton
configurations, even when the space-time is asymptotically conical. We also
show that there are no physical fermionic zero modes on these backgrounds. We
further generalize these results to the case of semilocal systems.
