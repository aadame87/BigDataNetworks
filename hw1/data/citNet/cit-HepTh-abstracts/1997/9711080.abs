  Recent developments involving strongly coupled superstrings are discussed
from a phenomenological point of view. In particular, strongly coupled
$E_8\times E'_8$ is described as an appropriate long-wavelength limit of
M-theory, and some generic phenomenological implications are analyzed,
including a long sought downward shift of the string unification scale and a
novel way to break supersymmetry. A specific scenario is presented that leads
to a rather light, and thus presently experimentally testable, sparticle
spectrum.
