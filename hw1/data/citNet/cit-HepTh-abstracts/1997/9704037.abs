  Cubic interactions are considered in 3 and 7 space dimensions, respectively,
for bosonic membranes in Poisson Bracket form. Their symmetries and vacuum
configurations are discussed. Their associated first order equations are
transformed to Nahm's equations, and are hence seen to be integrable, for the
3-dimensional case, by virtue of the explicit Lax pair provided. The
constructions introduced also apply to commutator or Moyal Bracket analogues.
