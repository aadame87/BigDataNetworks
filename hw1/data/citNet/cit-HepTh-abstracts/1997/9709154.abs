  We give the renormalization of the standard model of electroweak interactions
to all orders of perturbation theory by using the method of algebraic
renormalization, which is based on general properties of renormalized
perturbation theory and not on a specific regularization scheme. The Green
functions of the standard model are uniquely constructed to all orders, if one
defines the model by the Slavnov-Taylor identity,
 Ward-identities of rigid symmetry and a specific form of the abelian local
gauge Ward-identity, which continues the Gell-Mann Nishijima relation to higher
orders. Special attention is directed to the mass diagonalization of massless
and massive neutral vectors and ghosts. For obtaining off-shell infrared finite
expressions it is required to take into account higher order corrections into
the functional symmetry operators. It is shown, that the normalization
conditions of the on-shell schemes are in agreement with the most general
symmetry transformations allowed by the algebraic constraints.
