  We consider the XXZ model in the infinite volume limit with spin half quantum
space and higher spin auxiliary space. Using perturbation theory arguments, we
relate the half infinite transfer matrices of this class of models to certain
$U_q(\hat{sl_2})$ intertwiners introduced by Nakayashiki. We construct the
monodromy matrices, and show that the one with spin one auxiliary space gives
rise to the L operator.
