  We examine conformal rescaling and T-duality in the context of
four-dimensional HKT geometries. The closure of the torsion forces the
conformal factor to satisfy a modified harmonic equation. Because of this
equation the conformal factors form non-commutative groups acting on the HKT
geometries. Using conformal rescalings and T-duality transformations we
generate from flat space new families of HKT geometries with tri-holomorphic
Killing vectors. We also find ultraviolet-finite (4,0) supersymmetric sigma
models which are not conformally invariant.
