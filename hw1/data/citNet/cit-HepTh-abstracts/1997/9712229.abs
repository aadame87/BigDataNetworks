  Basic features of the conservation laws in the Hamiltonian approach to the
Poincar\'e gauge theory are presented. It is shown that the Hamiltonian is
given as a linear combination of ten first class constraints. The Poisson
bracket algebra of these constraints is used to construct the gauge generators.
By assuming that the asymptotic symmetry is the global Poincar\'e symmetry, we
derived the improved form of the asymptotic generators, and discussed the
related conservation laws of energy, momentum, etc.
