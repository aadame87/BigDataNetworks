  We propose that spacetime is fundamentally a property of matter, inseparable
from it. This leads us to suggest that all properties of matter must be
elevated to the same status as that of spacetime in quantum field theories of
matter. We suggest a specific method for extending field theories to accomodate
this, and point out how this leads to the evolution of fields through channels
other than the spacetime channel.
