  We show that the recently proposed matrix model for M theory obeys the cyclic
trace assumptions underlying generalized quantum or trace dynamics. This
permits a verification of supersymmetry as an operator calculation, and a
calculation of the supercharge density algebra by using the generalized Poisson
bracket, in a basis-independent manner that makes no reference to individual
matrix elements. Implications for quantization of the model are discussed. Our
results are a special case of a general result presented elsewhere, that all
rigid supersymmetry theories can be extended to give supersymmetric trace
dynamics theories, in which the supersymmetry algebra is represented by the
generalized Poisson bracket of trace supercharges, constructed from fields that
form a noncommutative trace class graded operator algebra.
