  Higgs branch of N=2 SQCD is studied from the M theory viewpoint. With a
differential geometrical proof of the s-rule besides an investigation on the
global symmetry of M theory brane configurations, an exact description of the
baryonic and non-baryonic branches in terms of M theory is presented. The
baryonic branch root is also studied. The ``electric'' and ``magnetic''
descriptions of the root are shown to be related with each other by the brane
exchange in M theory.
