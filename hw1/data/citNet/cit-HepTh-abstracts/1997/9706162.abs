Title: Variational Perturbation Approach to Resonance-State Wave Functions
Author: T. Tanaka (Univ. of Tsukuba)
Comments: 10 pages, RevTeX, 4 ps figures. There were some calculational
  mistakes in the previous manuscript. The correct results obtained by our
  method show excellent agreement with the exact solutions
Report-no: UTHEP-362
\\
  The variational perturbation theory for wave functions, which has been shown
to work well for bound states of the anharmonic oscillator, is applied to
resonance states of the anharmonic oscillator with negative coupling constant.
We obtain uniformly accurate wave functions starting from the bound states.
