  The behavior of the beta-function of the low-energy effective coupling in the
N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) QCD with several massive matter hypermultiplets and in
the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory is determined near the superconformal points in the
moduli space. The renormalization group flow is unambiguously fixed by looking
at limited types of deformation near the superconformal points. It is pointed
out that the scaling dimension of the beta-function is controlled by the
scaling behavior of moduli parameters and the relation between them is
explicitly worked out. Our scaling dimensions of the beta-functions are
consistent in part with the results obtained recently by Bilal and Ferrari in a
different method for the SU(2) QCD.
