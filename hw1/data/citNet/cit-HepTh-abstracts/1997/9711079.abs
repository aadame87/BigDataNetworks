  A 3-dimensional non-abelian gauge theory was proposed by Jackiw and Pi to
create mass for the gauge fields. However, the quadratic action obtained by
switching off the non-abelian interactions possesses more gauge symmetries than
the original one, causing some difficulties in quantization. Jackiw and Pi
proposed another action by introducing new fields, whose gauge symmetries are
consistent with the quadratic part. It is shown that all of these theories have
the same number of physical degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian framework.
Hence, as far as the physical states are considered there is no inconsistency.
Nevertheless, perturbation expansion is still problematic. To cure this we
propose to modify one of the constraints of the non-abelian theory without
altering neither its canonical hamiltonian nor the number of physical states.
