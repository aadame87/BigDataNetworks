  We propose a unitary matrix model as a regularization of the IIB matrix model
of Ishibashi-Kawai-Kitazawa-Tsuchiya (IKKT). The fermionic part is incorporated
using the overlap formalism in order to avoid unwanted ``doublers'' while
preserving the global gauge invariance. This regularization, unlike the one
adopted by IKKT, has manifest U(1)^10 symmetry, which corresponds to the
ten-dimensional translational invariance of the space time. We calculate
one-loop effective action around some typical BPS-saturated configurations in
the weak coupling limit. We also discuss a possible scenario for the dynamical
generation of the four-dimensional space time through spontaneous breakdown of
the U(1)^10 symmetry in the double scaling limit.
