  We formulate a non-linear system of equations which describe higher-spin
gauge interactions of massive matter fields in 2+1 dimensional space-time and
explain some properties of the deformed oscillator algebra which underlies this
formulation. In particular we show that the parameter of mass $M$ of matter
fields is related to the deformation parameter in this algebra.
