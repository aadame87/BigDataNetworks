  We obtain actions for N D-branes occupying points in a manifold with
arbitrary Kahler metric. In one complex dimension, the action is uniquely
determined (up to second order in commutators) by the requirement that it
reproduce the masses of stretched strings and by imposing supersymmetry. These
conditions are very restrictive in higher dimensions as well. The results
provide a noncommutative extension of Kahler geometry.
