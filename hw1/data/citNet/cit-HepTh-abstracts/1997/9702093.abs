  The perturbative analysis of models of open and closed superstrings presents
a number of surprises. For instance, variable numbers of antisymmetric tensors
ensure their consistency via generalized Green-Schwarz cancellations and a
novel type of singularity occurs in their moduli spaces. All these features are
related, in one way or another, to the presence of boundaries on the world
sheet or, equivalently, of extended objects (branes) interacting with the bulk
theory in space time. String dualities have largely widened the interest in
these models, that exhibit a wealth of generic non-perturbative features of
String Theory.
