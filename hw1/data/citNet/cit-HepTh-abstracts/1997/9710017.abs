  The present paper deals with N=1 2D supersymmetric integrable quantum field
theory. The S-matrix proposed to describe the interactions between
supersymmetric particles is applied to theories involving topological
excitations of zero central charge. Bound states can fit consistently within
this type of theories, since the bootstrap can be shown to close. The
topological character of the excitations and the similarity with the scattering
of particles is fully understood when a kink sector is introduced in the
theory.
