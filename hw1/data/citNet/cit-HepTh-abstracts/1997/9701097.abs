  It is well known through a recent work of Bernard, Gaudin, Haldane and
Pasquier (BGHP) that the usual spin Calogero-Sutherland (CS) model, containing
particles with $M$ internal degrees of freedom, respects the $Y(gl_M)$ Yangian
symmetry. By following and suitably modifying the approach of BGHP, in this
article we construct a novel class of spin CS models which exhibit
multi-parameter deformed or `nonstandard' variants of $Y(gl_M)$ Yangian
symmetry. An interesting feature of such CS Hamiltonians is that they contain
many-body spin dependent interactions, which can be calculated directly from
the associated rational solutions of Yang-Baxter equation. Moreover, these spin
dependent interactions often lead to `anyon like' representations of
permutation algebra on the combined internal space of all particles. We also
find out the general forms of conserved quantities as well as Lax pairs for the
above mentioned class of spin CS models, and describe the method of
constructing their exact wave functions.
