  General properties of intersecting extremal p-brane solutions of gravity
coupled with dilatons and several different d-form fields in arbitrary
space-time dimensions are considered. It is show that heuristically expected
properties of the intersecting p-branes follow from the explicit formulae for
solutions. In particular, harmonic superposition and S-duality hold for all
p-brane solutions. Generalized T-duality takes place under additional
restrictions on the initial theory parameters .
