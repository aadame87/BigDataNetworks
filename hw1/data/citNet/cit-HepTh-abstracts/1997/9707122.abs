  The experimental observation of intense light emission by acoustically
driven, periodically collapsing bubbles of air in water (sonoluminescence) has
yet to receive an adequate explanation. One of the most intriguing ideas is
that the conversion of acoustic energy into photons occurs quantum
mechanically, through a dynamical version of the Casimir effect. We have argued
elsewhere that in the adiabatic approximation, which should be reliable here,
Casimir or zero-point energies cannot possibly be large enough to be relevant.
(About 10 MeV of energy is released per collapse.) However, there are
sufficient subtleties involved that others have come to opposite conclusions.
In particular, it has been suggested that bulk energy, that is, simply the
naive sum of ${1\over2}\hbar\omega$, which is proportional to the volume, could
be relevant. We show that this cannot be the case, based on general principles
as well as specific calculations. In the process we further illuminate some of
the divergence difficulties that plague Casimir calculations, with an example
relevant to the bag model of hadrons.
