  The long-range, spin-dependent forces between D0-branes are related to
long-range fundamental string interactions using duality. These interactions
can then be computed by taking the long distance non-relativistic expansion of
string four-point amplitudes. The results are in accord with the general
constraints of Matrix Theory.
