  We extend to a general class of covariant gauges an approach which relates
the thermal Green functions to forward scattering amplitudes of thermal
particles. A brief discussion of the non-transversality of the thermal gluon
polarization tensor is given in this context. This method is then applied to
the calculation of the ln(T) contributions associated with general
configurations of 2 and 3-point gluon functions. The results are Lorentz
covariant and have the same structure as the ultraviolet divergent
contributions which occur at zero temperature.
