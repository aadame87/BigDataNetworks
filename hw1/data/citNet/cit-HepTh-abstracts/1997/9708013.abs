  The 2-dimensional version of the Schwarz and Sen duality model (Tseytlin
model) is analyzed at the classical and quantum levels. The solutions are
obtained after removing the gauge dependent sector using the Dirac method. The
Poincar\`e invariance is verified at both levels. An extension with global
supersymmetry is also proposed.
