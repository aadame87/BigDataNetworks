  Gauge-invariant systems of a general form with higher order derivatives of
gauge parameters are investigated within the framework of the BFV formalism.
Higher order terms of the BRST charge and BRST-invariant Hamiltonian are
obtained. It is shown that the identification rules for Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian ghost variables depend on the choice of the extension of
constraints from the primary constraint surface.
