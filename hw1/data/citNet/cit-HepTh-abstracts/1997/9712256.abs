\\
  A closed formula for the structure constants in the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZNW model
is derived by a method previously used in Liouville theory. With the help of a
reflection amplitude that follows from the structure constants one obtains a
proposal for the fusion rules from canonical quantization. Taken together these
pieces of information allow an unambigous definition of any genus zero n-point
function.
