  We study how the decay properties of particles are changed by acceleration.
It is shown that under the influence of acceleration (1) the lifetime of
particles is modified and (2) new processes (like the decay of the proton)
become possible. This is illustrated by considering scalar models for the decay
of muons, pions, and protons. We discuss the close conceptual relation between
these processes and the Unruh effect.
