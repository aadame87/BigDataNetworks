  Actions for two-superparticle system in (10,2) dimensions and
three-superparticle systems in (11,3) dimensions are constructed. These actions
have worldline bosonic and fermionic local symmetries, and target space global
supersymmety generalizing the reparametrization, kappa-symmetry and Poincare
supersymmetry of the usual superparticle. With the second particle, or the
second and third particles on-shell, they describe a superparticle propagating
in the background of a second superparticle in (10,2) dimensions, or two other
superparticles in (11,3) dimensions. Symmetries of the action are shown to
exist in presence of super Yang-Mills background as well.
