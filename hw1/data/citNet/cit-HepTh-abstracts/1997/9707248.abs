  Critical dynamics of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, coupled to a constant
electromagnetic field in D=2, 3, and 4, is reconsidered from a viewpoint of
infrared behavior and vacuum instability. The latter is associated with
constant electric fields and cannot be avoidable in the nonperturbative
framework obtained through the proper time method. As for magnetic fields, an
infrared cut-off is essential to investigate the critical phenomena. The result
reconfirms the fact that the critical coupling in D=3 and 4 goes to zero even
under an infinitesimal magnetic field. There also shows that a non-vanishing
$F_{\mu\nu}\widetilde F^{\mu\nu}$ causes instability. A perturbation with
respect to external fields is adopted to investigate critical quantities, but
the resultant asymptotic expansion excellently matches with the exact value.
