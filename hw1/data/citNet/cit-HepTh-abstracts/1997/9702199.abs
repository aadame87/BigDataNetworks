  We study orbifolds of (0,2) models and their relation to (0,2) mirror
symmetry. In the Landau-Ginzburg phase of a (0,2) model the superpotential
features a whole bunch of discrete symmetries, which by quotient action lead to
a variety of consistent (0,2) vacua. We study a few examples in very much
detail. Furthermore, we comment on the application of (0,2) mirror symmetry to
the calculation of Yukawa couplings in the space-time superpotential.
