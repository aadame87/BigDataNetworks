  We review an approach to the construction and classification of p-brane
solitons in arbitrary dimensions, with an emphasis on those that arise in
toroidally-compactified M-theory. Procedures for constructing the low-energy
supergravity limits in arbitrary dimensions, and for studying the supersymmetry
properties of the solitons are presented. Wide classes of p-brane solutions are
obtained, and their properties and classification in terms of bound states and
intersections of M-branes are described. (Based on lectures presented at the
Summer School in High-Energy Physics and Cosmology, Trieste, Italy, 10 Jun - 26
Jul 1996.)
