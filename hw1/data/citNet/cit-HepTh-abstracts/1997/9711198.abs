  A variational calculation is presented of the ADM-energy of the quantized
gravitational field around a wormhole solution of the classical Einstein's
equations. One finds the energy of such state to be in general lower than the
perturbative ground state, in which the quantized gravity field fluctuates
around flat (Euclidean) space-time. As a result the strong indication emerges
that a gas (or a lattice) of wormholes of Planck mass and average distance
$l_p$, the Planck length, may be a good approximation of the Ground State of
Quantum Gravity, some implications of which are reviewed.
