  We calculate the entropy of six dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in
matrix theory. We use the description of the matrix model on $T^5$ as the
world-volume theory of NS five-branes and show that the black hole entropy is
reproduced by noncritical closed strings with fractional tension living on the
five-brane.
