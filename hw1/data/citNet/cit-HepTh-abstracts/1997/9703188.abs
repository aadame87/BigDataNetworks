  We give a complete classification of the real forms of simple nonlinear
superconformal algebras (SCA) and quasi-superconformal algebras (QSCA) and
present a unified realization of these algebras with simple symmetry groups.
This classification is achieved by establishing a correspondence between simple
nonlinear QSCA's and SCA's and quaternionic and super-quaternionic symmetric
spaces of simple Lie groups and Lie supergroups, respectively. The unified
realization involves a dimension zero boson (dilaton), dimension one symmetry
currents and dimension 1/2 free bosons for QSCA'a and dimension 1/2 free
fermions for SCA's. The dimension 1/2 free bosons and fermions are associated
with the quaternionic and super-quaternionic symmetric spaces of corresponding
Lie groups and Lie supergroups, respectively. We conclude with a discussion of
possible applications of our results.
