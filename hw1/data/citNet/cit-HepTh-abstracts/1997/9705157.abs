  We use an extension of the method due to Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, and
Tyutin (BFFT) for transforming the nonlinear $\sigma$ model in a non-Abelian
gauge theory. We deal with both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric cases. The
bosonic case was already considered in literature but just gauged with an
Abelian algebra. We show that the supersymmetric version is only compatible
with a non-Abelian gauge theory. The usual BFFT method for this case leads to a
nonlocal algebra.
