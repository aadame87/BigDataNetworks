\\
  For a calculation of divergent fermion string amplitudes a regularization
procedure invariant under the supermodular group is constructed. By this
procedure superstring amplitudes of an arbitrary genus are calculated using
both partition functions and superfield vacuum correlators computed early. A
finiteness of superstring amplitudes and related topics are discussed.
