  We discuss general bosonic stationary configurations of N=2, D=4 supergravity
coupled to vector multiplets. The requirement of unbroken supersymmetries
imposes constraints on the holomorphic symplectic section of the underlying
special K\"ahler manifold. The corresponding solutions of the field equations
are completely determined by a set of harmonic functions. As examples we
discuss rotating black holes, Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson like instantons for
the STU model. In addition, we discuss, in the static limit, worldsheet
instanton corrections to the STU black hole solution, in the neighbourhood of a
vanishing 4-cycle of the Calabi-Yau manifold. Our procedure is quite general
and includes all known black hole solutions that can be embedded into N=2
supergravity.
