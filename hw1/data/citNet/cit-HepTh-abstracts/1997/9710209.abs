  A particle in quantum mechanics on manifolds couples to the induced
topological gauge field that characterises the possible inequivalent
quantizations. For instance, the gauge potential induced on $S^2$ is that of a
magnetic monopole located at the center of $S^2$. We find that the gauge
potential induced on $S^3$ ($S^{2n+1}$) is that of a meron (generalized meron)
also sitting at the center of $S^3$ ($S^{2n+1}$).
