  There has been some controversies at the large $N$ behaviour of the 2D
Yang-Mills and chiral 2D Yang-Mills theories. To be more specific, is there a
one parameter family of minima of the free energy in the strong region, or the
minimum is unique. We show that there is a missed equation which, added to the
known equations, makes the minimum unique.
