Title: M-theory from its superalgebra
Authors: P.K. Townsend
Comments: 43 pp. Cargese lectures 1997. Minor errors corrected, as in previous
  revisions

  These lectures explore what can be learnt about M-theory from its
superalgebra. The first three lectures introduce the 'basic' branes of
M-theory, and type II superstring theories, and show how the duality relations
between them are encoded in the respective spacetime superalgebras. The fourth
lecture introduces brane intersections and explains how they are encoded in the
worldvolume superalgebras.
