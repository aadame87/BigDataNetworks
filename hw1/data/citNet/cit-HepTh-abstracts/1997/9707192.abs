  Type IIA brane configurations are used to construct N=2 supersymmetric gauge
theories in two dimensions. Using localization of chiral multiplets in
ten-dimensional spacetime, supersymmetric non-linear sigma models with target
space such as $\CP^{n-1}$ and the Grassmann manifolds are studied in detail.
The quantum properties of these models are realized in $M$ theory by taking the
strong Type IIA coupling limit. The brane picture implies an equivalence
between the parameter space of N=2 supersymmetric theories in two dimensions
and the moduli space of vacua of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four
dimensions. Effects like level-rank duality are interpreted in the brane
picture as continuation past infinite coupling. The BPS solitons of the
$\CP^{n-1}$ model are identified as topological excitations of a membrane and
their masses are computed. This provides the brane realization of higher rank
tensor representations of the flavor group.
