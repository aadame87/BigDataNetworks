Title: Duality Invariance of Black Hole Creation Rates
Authors: David Brown
Comments: 8 pages, REVTEX
Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D56 (1997) 1001-1004
\\
  Pair creation of electrically charged black holes and its dual process, pair
creation of magnetically charged black holes, are considered. It is shown that
the creation rates are equal provided the boundary conditions for the two
processes are dual to one another. This conclusion follows from a careful
analysis of boundary terms and boundary conditions for the Maxwell action.
