  Motivated by manifest Lorentz symmetry and a well-defined large-N limit
prescription, we study the supersymmetric quantum mechanics proposed as a model
for the collective dynamics of D0-branes from the point of view of the
11-dimensional supermembrane. We argue that the continuity of the spectrum
persists irrespective of the presence of winding around compact target-space
directions and discuss the central charges in the superalgebra arising from
winding membrane configurations. Along the way we comment on the structure of
open supermembranes.
