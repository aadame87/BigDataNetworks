  Starting from topological quantum field theory, we derive space-time
uncertainty relation with respect to the time interval and the spatial length
proposed by Yoneya through breakdown of topological symmetry in the large N
matrix model. This work suggests that the topological symmetry might be an
underlying higher symmetry behind the space-time uncertainty principle of
string theory.
