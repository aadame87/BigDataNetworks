  We discuss massive scalar field with conformal coupling in
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe of special type with constant
electromagnetic field. Treating an external gravitational-electromagnetic
background exactly, at first time the proper-time representations for out-in,
in-in, and out-out scalar Green functions are explicitly constructed as
proper-time integrals over the corresponding (complex) contours. The
vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitudes and number of created particles are
found and vacuum instability is discussed. The mean values of the current and
energy-momentum tensor are evaluated, and different approximations for them are
investigated. The back reaction of the particles created to the electromagnetic
field is estimated in different regimes. The connection between proper-time
method and effective action is outlined. The effective action in scalar QED in
weakly-curved FRW Universe (De Sitter space) with weak constant electromagnetic
field is found as derivative expansion over curvature and electromagnetic field
strength. Possible further applications of the results are briefly mentioned.
