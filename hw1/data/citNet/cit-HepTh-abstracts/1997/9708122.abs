  We identify the 4D field theories living on the world volume of D4 branes in
non-supersymmetric type IIA string theory constructions. They are softly broken
N=2 SQCD with the breakings introduced through vevs of the auxilliary fields in
the spurion coupling field. Exact solutions of these theories for perturbing
soft breakings exist in the literature. We calculate the ratios of string
tensions in softly broken N=2 SU(N) gauge theory testing the recently proposed
M-theory prediction. The semi-classical result of M-theory is renormalized in
the non-supersymmetric models.
