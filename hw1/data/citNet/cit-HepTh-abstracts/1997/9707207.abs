  We show that there exist nonlinearly realised duality symmetries that are
independent of the standard supergravity global symmetries, and which provide
active spectrum-generating symmetries for the fundamental BPS solitons. The
additional ingredient, in any spacetime dimension, is a single scaling
transformation that allows one to map between BPS solitons with different
masses. Without the inclusion of this additional transformation, which is a
symmetry of the classical equations of motion, but not the action, it is not
possible to find a spectrum-generating symmetry. The necessity of including
this scaling transformation highlights the vulnerability of duality multiplets
to quantum anomalies. We argue that fundamental BPS solitons may be immune to
this threat.
