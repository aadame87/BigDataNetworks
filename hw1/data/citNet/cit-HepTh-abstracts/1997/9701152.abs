  We review the macroscopic and microscopic properties of black holes of
toroidally compactified heterotic and Type II string theory in dimensions
4<=D<=9. General charged rotating black hole solutions are obtained by acting
on a generating solution with classical duality symmetries. In D=4, D=5 and
6<=D<=9, the generating solution for both toroidally compactified Type II and
heterotic strings is specified by the ADM mass, [(D-1)/2]-angular momentum
components and five, three and two charges, respectively. We give the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for these solutions, address the BPS-saturated limit
and compare the results to calculations of the microscopic entropy both in the
NS-NS sector and the R-R sector of the theory. We also interpret such black
hole solutions as dimensionally reduced intersecting p-branes of M-theory.
