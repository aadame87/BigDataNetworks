  The potential between two D4-branes at angles with partially unbroken
supersymmetry is computed, and is used to discuss the creation of a fundamental
string when two such D4-branes cross each other in M(atrix) theory. The
effective Lagrangian is shown to be anomalous at 1-loop approximation, but it
can be modified by bare Chern-Simons terms to preserve the invariance under the
large gauge transformation. The resulting effective potential agrees with that
obtained from the string calculations. The result shows that a fundamental
string is created in order to cancel the repulsive force between two D4-branes
at proper angles.
