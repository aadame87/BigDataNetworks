  We study, through path-integral methods, an extension of the massive Thirring
model in which the interaction between currents is non-local. By examining the
mass-expansion of the partition function we show that this non-local massive
Thirring model is equivalent to a certain non-local extension of the
sine-Gordon theory. Thus, we establish a non-local generalization of the famous
Coleman's equivalence. We also discuss some possible applications of this
result in the context of one-dimensional strongly correlated systems and
finite-size Quantum Field Theories.
