  This is a general introduction to duality in field theories. The existence
and breaking of global symmetries is used as a guideline to systematically
prove duality between different field theories. Systems discussed include
abelian and non-abelian T-duality in string theory, abelian and nonabelian
bosonization, and duality for massless and massive antisymmetric tensor field
theories in arbitrary number of dimensions. Open questions regarding these
techniques are also discussed. (Lectures given at 33rd Karpacz Winter School
`Duality: Strings and Fields' .)
