  In a recent paper it was shown that the properties of Schwarzschild black
holes in 8 dimensions are correctly described up to factors of order unity by
Matrix theory compactified on T^3. Here we consider compactifications on tori
of general dimension d. Although in general little is known about the relevant
d+1 dimensional theories on the dual tori, there are hints from their
application to near-extreme parallel Dirichlet d-branes. Using these hints we
get the correct mass-entropy scaling for Schwarzschild black holes in (11-d)
dimensions.
