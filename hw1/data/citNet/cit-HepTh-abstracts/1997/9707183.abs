  The null string's equations of motion and constraints in the Kerr spacetime
are given. We assume a generic ansatz for the null strings in the Kerr
spacetime and we present the resulting solutions in quadratures. Some specific
string configurations, that follow from the generic one, are considered
separately. In each case we also extract the corresponding solutions in the
Schwarzschild spacetime.
