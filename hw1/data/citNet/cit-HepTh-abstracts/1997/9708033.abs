  We apply stochastic quantization method to real symmetric matrix-vector
models for the second quantization of non-orientable strings, including both
open and closed strings. The Fokker-Planck hamiltonian deduces a well-defined
non-orientable open-closed string field theory at the double scaling limit of
the matrix model. There appears a new algebraic structure in the continuum F-P
hamiltonian including a Virasoro algebra and a $SO(r)$ current algebra.
