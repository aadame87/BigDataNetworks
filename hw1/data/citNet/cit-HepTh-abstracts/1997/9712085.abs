  We present subsingular vectors of the N=2 superconformal algebras other than
the ones which become singular in chiral Verma modules, reported recently by
Gato-Rivera and Rosado. We show that two large classes of singular vectors of
the Topological algebra become subsingular vectors of the Antiperiodic NS
algebra under the topological untwistings. These classes consist of BRST-
invariant singular vectors with relative charges $q=-2,-1$ and zero conformal
weight, and no-label singular vectors with $q=0,-1$. In turn the resulting NS
subsingular vectors are transformed by the spectral flows into subsingular and
singular vectors of the Periodic R algebra. We write down these singular and
subsingular vectors starting from the topological singular vectors at levels 1
and 2.
