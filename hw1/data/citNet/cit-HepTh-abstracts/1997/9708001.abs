  We present the covariant BRST quantization of the super-D-string. The
non-vanishing supersymmetric U(1) field strength ${\cal F}$ is essential for
the covariant quantization of the super-D-string as well as for its static
picture. A SO(2) parameter parametrizes a family of local supersymmetric (kappa
symmetric) systems including the super-D-string with ${\cal F}\ne 0$ and the
Green-Schwarz superstring with ${\cal F}= 0$. We suggest that $E^1$ (canonical
conjugate of U(1) gauge field) plays a role of the order parameter in the
Green-Schwarz formalism: the super-D-string exists for $E^1 \ne 0$ while the
fundamental Green-Schwarz superstring exists only for $E^1 =0$.
