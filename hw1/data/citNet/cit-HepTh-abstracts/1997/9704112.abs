  We consider five-dimensional black holes modeled by D-strings bound to
D5-branes, with momentum along the D-strings. We study the greybody factors for
the non-minimally coupled scalars which originate from the gravitons and R-R
antisymmetric tensor particles polarized along the 5-brane, with one index
along the string and the other transverse to the string. These scalars, which
we call intermediate, couple to the black holes differently from the minimal
and the fixed scalars which were studied previously. Analysis of their
fluctuations around the black hole reveals a surprising mixing between these
NS-NS and R-R scalars. We disentangle this mixing and obtain two decoupled
scalar equations. These equations have some new features, and we are able to
calculate the greybody factors only in certain limits. The results agree with
corresponding calculations in the effective string model provided one of the
intermediate scalars couples to an operator of dimension (1,2), while the other
to an operator of dimension (2,1). Thus, the intermediate scalars are sensitive
probes of the chiral operators in the effective string action.
