  We show that the supersymmetric Wilson loops in IIB matrix model give a
transition operator from reduced supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to
supersymmetric space-time theory. In comparison with Green-Schwarz superstring
we identify the supersymmetric Wilson loops with the asymptotic states of IIB
superstring. It is pointed out that the supersymmetry transformation law of the
Wilson loops is the inverse of that for the vertex operators of massless modes
in the U(N) open superstring with Dirichlet boundary condition.
