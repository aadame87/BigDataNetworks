  We show that six-dimensional supergravity coupled to tensor and Yang-Mills
multiplets admits not one but two different theories as global limits, one of
which was previously thought not to arise as a global limit and the other of
which is new. The new theory has the virtue that it admits a global
anti-self-dual string solution obtained as the limit of the curved-space gauge
dyonic string, and can, in particular, describe tensionless strings. We
speculate that this global model can also represent the worldvolume theory of
coincident branes. We also discuss the Bogomol'nyi bounds of the gauge dyonic
string and show that, contrary to expectations, zero eigenvalues of the
Bogomol'nyi matrix do not lead to enhanced supersymmetry and that negative
tension does not necessarily imply a naked singularity.
