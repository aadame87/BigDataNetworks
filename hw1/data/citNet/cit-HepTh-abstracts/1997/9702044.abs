  The question of the stability of the four dimensional Gross-Perry-Sorkin
Kaluza-Klein magnetic monopole solution is investigated within the framework of
a N=2, D=5 supergravity theory. We show that this solution does not support a
spin structure of the Killing type and is therefore, contrary to previous
expectations, not necessarily stable.
