  We quantize massive vector theory in such a way that it has a well-defined
massless limit. In contrast to the approach by St\"uckelberg where ghost fields
are introduced to maintain manifest Lorentz covariance, we use reduced phase
space quantization with nonlocal dynamical variables which in the massless
limit smoothly turn into the photons, and check explicitly that the Poincare
algebra is fullfilled. In contrast to conventional covariant quantization our
approach leads to a propagator which has no singularity in the massless limit
and is well behaved for large momenta. For massive QED, where the vector field
is coupled to a conserved fermion current, the quantum theory of the nonlocal
vector fields is shown to be equivalent to that of the standard local vector
fields. An inequivalent theory, however, is obtained when the reduced nonlocal
massive vector field is coupled to a nonconserved classical current.
