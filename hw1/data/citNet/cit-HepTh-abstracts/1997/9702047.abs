  A guiding principle to determine the Kaehler potential in the low energy
effective theory of the supersymmetric chiral gauge theory with no flat
direction is proposed. The guiding principle is applied to the SU(5) gauge
theory with chiral superfields in the 5* and 10 representation, and the low
energy effective theory is consistently constructed. The spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking takes place in the low energy effective theory as
expected. The particle mass spectrum in the low energy is explicitly
calculated.
