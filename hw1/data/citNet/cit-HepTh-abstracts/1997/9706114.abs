Title: On extension of minimality principle in supersymmetric electrodynamics
Authors: V.V. Tugai, A.A. Zheltukhin
Comments: 6 pages REVTeX (talk at the seminar "Supersymmetry and quantum field
  theory" dedicated to the memory of Acad. Dmitrij Volkov, Kharkov, Jan. 1997)
  Resubmition (27.06.97): some misprints in formulae (2) and (36) are
  corrected, an omitted term in formula (15) is added. Resubmition (06.11.97):
  Incorect sign in last line of formula (15) is corrected. Information about
  government and international grants is added
\\
  A possibility of an extension of the minimality principle for electromagnetic
interactions of charged and neutral particles having spin 1/2 is investigated.
