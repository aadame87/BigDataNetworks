  We generalize the Gibbons-Wiltshire solution of four dimensional Kaluza-Klein
black holes in order to describe Type IIA solutions of bound states of D6 and
D0-branes. We probe the solutions with a D6-brane and a D0-brane. We also probe
a system of D2+D0-branes and of a D2-brane bound to a F1-string with a
D2-brane. A precise agreement between the SYM and the SUGRA calculations is
found for the static force as well as for the $v^2$ force in all cases.
