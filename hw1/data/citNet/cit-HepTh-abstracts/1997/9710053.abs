  We study the two-point correlators of the currents of the $E_8$ global
symmetry in the $N=(1,0)$ superconformal six-dimensional theory as well as in
the 4D superconformal theories upon toroidal compactification. From the
high-energy behavior of the correlator we deduce that in 4D 10 copies of the
superconformal theory with $E_8$ global symmetry can be coupled to an N=2 $E_8$
gauge theory. We present three alternative derivations for the expression for
the correlators. One from field-theory, one from M-theory and one from
F-theory.
