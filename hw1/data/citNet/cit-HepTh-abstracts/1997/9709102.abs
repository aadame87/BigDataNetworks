  It is well known that charges coupled to a pure Chern-Simons gauge field in
(2+1) dimensions undergo an effective change of statistics, i.e., become
anyons. We will consider several generalizations thereof, arising when the
gauge field is more general. The first one is ``multispecies anyons''---charged
particles of several species coupled to one, or possibly several, Chern-Simons
fields. The second one is finite-size anyons, which are charged particles
coupled to a gauge field described by the Chern-Simons term plus some other
term. In fact, rigorously speaking, quasielectrons and quasiholes in the
fractional quantum Hall effect are multispecies finite-size anyons. The third
one is an analog of finite-size anyons which arises in a model with a mixed
Chern-Simons term; notably, this model is P,T-invariant, which opens the way
for practical applications even when there is no parity-breaking magnetic
field.
