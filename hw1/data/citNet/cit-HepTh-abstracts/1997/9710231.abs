  This is an expanded version of talks given by the author at the Trieste
Spring School on Supergravity and Superstrings in April of 1997 and at the
accompanying workshop. The manuscript is intended to be a mini-review of Matrix
Theory. The motivations and some of the evidence for the theory are presented,
as well as a clear statement of the current puzzles about compactification to
low dimensions.
