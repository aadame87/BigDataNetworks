  We study the asymptotic solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for the
color-singlet reggeon compound states in multi-color QCD. We show that in the
leading order of asymptotic expansion, quasiclassical reggeon trajectories have
a form of the soliton waves propagating on the 2-dimensional plane of
transverse coordinates. Applying methods of the finite-gap theory we construct
their explicit form in terms of Riemann theta-functions and examine their
properties.
