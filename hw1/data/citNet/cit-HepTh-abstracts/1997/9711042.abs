  Eleven dimensional supergravity has electric type currents arising from the
Chern-Simon and anomaly terms in the action. However the bulk charge integrates
to zero for asymptotically flat solutions with topological trivial spatial
sections. We show that by relaxing the boundary conditions to generalisations
of the ALE and ALF boundary conditions in four dimensions one can obtain static
solutions with a bulk charge preserving between 1/16 and 1/4 of the
supersymmetries. One can introduce membranes with the same sign of charge into
these backgrounds. This raises the possibility that these generalized membranes
might decay quantum mechanically to leave just a bulk distribution of charge.
Alternatively and more probably, a bulk distribution of charge can decay into a
collection of singlely charged membranes. Dimensional reductions of these
solutions lead to novel representations of extreme black holes in four
dimensions with up to four charges. We discuss how the eleven-dimensional
Kaluza-Klein monopole wrapped around a space with non-zero first Pontryagin
class picks up an electric charge proportional to the Pontryagin number.
