Title: Toroidal Confugurations As Stable Solitons
Authors: L. Faddeev and A.J. Niemi
Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures
\\
  Previously we have proposed that in certain relativistic quantum field
theories knotlike configurations may appear as stable solitons. Here we present
a detailed investigation of the simplest knotted soliton, the torus-shaped
unknot.
