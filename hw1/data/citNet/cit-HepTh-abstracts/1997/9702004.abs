  New features of systems with non-trivial topology such as fractional quantum
numbers, inequivalent quantizations, good operators, topological anomalies,
etc. are described in the framework of an algebraic quantization procedure on a
group. Modular invariance naturally appears as a subgroup of good operators in
the particular case of the torus.
