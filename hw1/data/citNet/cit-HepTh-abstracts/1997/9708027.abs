  We investigate the zero temperature chiral phase transition in
(2+1)-dimensional QED in the presence of a Chern-Simons term, changing the
number of fermion flavors. In the symmetric phase, there are no light degrees
of freedom even at the critical point. Unlike the case without a Chern-Simons
term, the phase transition is first-order.
