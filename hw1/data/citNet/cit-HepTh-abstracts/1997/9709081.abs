  Four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Spin(N) gauge theories with matter in the
vector and spinor representations are considered. Dual descriptions are known
for some of these theories. It is noted that when masses are given to all
fields in the spinor representation, the dual gauge group G breaks to a group H
such that \pi_2(G/H)=Z_2. The quantum numbers of the associated Z_2 monopole
and those of the massive spinors are shown to agree, suggesting that the
monopole is the image of the massive spinors under duality. It follows that
electric sources in the spinor representation, needed as test charges to
determine the phase of an SO(N) gauge theory, can be introduced as Z_2-valued
magnetic sources in the dual nonabelian gauge theory. This fact is used to
study the phases of SO(N) gauge theories with matter in the vector
representation.
