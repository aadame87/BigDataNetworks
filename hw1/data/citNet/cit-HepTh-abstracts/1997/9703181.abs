\\
  Embedding of Klein-Gordon and Dirac particle onto Riemannian submanifold in
higher dimensional Minkowski space is given by using Hamiltonian BRST
formalism. Up to the ordering and quantum potential term induced by embedding,
obtained K-G equation is the usual one in Riemannian space, instead, the
obtained Dirac equation is essentially different from the usual well known form
using vierbein. The requirement of equivalence between two Dirac equations
gives the property of natural-frame for spinor.
