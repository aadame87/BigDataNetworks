  Baker, Ball and Zachariasen have developed an elegant formulation of the dual
superconducting model of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which allows one to use
the field equations to eliminate the gluon and Higgs degrees of freedom and
thus to express the interaction between quarks as an effective potential.
Carrying out an expansion in inverse powers of the constituent quark masses,
these authors succeeded in identifying the central part, the spin-dependent
part and the leading relativistic corrections to the central potential. The
potential offers a good account of the energies and splittings of charmonium
and the upsilon system. Since all of the flavor dependence of the interaction
is presumed to enter through the constituent masses, it is possible to test the
potential in other systems. Logical candidates are the heavy B-flavor charmed
system and the heavy-light systems, which should be more sensitive to the
relativistic corrections. Lattice gauge calculations furnish an additional
point of contact for the components of the BBZ potential. Some preliminary
calculations of the energies of B and D mesons are presented and the challenge
of agreement with experiment is discussed. The spinless Salpeter equation is
used to account for the effects of relativistic kinematics.
