  We discuss epsilon-expansion in curved spacetime for asymptotically free and
asymptotically non-free theories. The esistence of stable and unstable fixed
points is investigated for $f \phi^4$ and SU(2) gauge theory. It is shown that
epsilon-expansion maybe compatible with asymptotic freedom on special solutions
of the RG equations in a special case (supersymmetric theory). Using
epsilon-expansion RG technique the effective Lagrangian for covariantly
constant gauge SU(2) field and effective potential for gauged NJL-model are
found in 4-epsilon- dimensional curved space (in linear curvature
approximation). The curvature- induced phase transitions from symmetric phase
to asymmetric phase (chromomagnetic vacuum and chiral symmetry broken phase,
respectively) are discussed for the above two models.
