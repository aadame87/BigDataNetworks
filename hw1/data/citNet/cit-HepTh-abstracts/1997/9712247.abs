  We examine the general conditions for the existence of the complex structure
intrinsic in the Gupta-Bleuler quantization method for the specific case of
mixed first and second class fermionic constraints in an arbitrary space-time
dimension. The cases d=3 and 10 are shown to be of prime importance. The
explicit solution for d=10 is presented.
