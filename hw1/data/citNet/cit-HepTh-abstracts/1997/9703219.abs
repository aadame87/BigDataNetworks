  Differential regularization is used to investigate the one-loop quantum
corrections to Chern-Simons-Maxwell spinor and scalar electrodynamics. We
illustrate the techniques to write the loop amplitudes in coordinate space. The
short-distance expansion method is developed to perform the Fourier
transformation of the amplitudes into momentum space and the possible
renormalization ambiguity in Chern-Simons type gauge theories in terms of
differential regularization is discussed. We also stress that the surface terms
appearing in the differential regularization should be kept along for finite
theories and they will result in the finite renormalization ambiguity.
