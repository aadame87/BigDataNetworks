  We calculate the instanton corrections in the effective prepotential for N=2
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with all A-D-E gauge groups from the
Seiberg-Witten geometry constructed out of the spectral curves of the affine
Toda lattice. The one-instanton contribution is determined explicitly by
solving the Gauss-Manin system associated with the A-D-E singularity. Our
results are in complete agreement with the ones obtained from the microscopic
instanton calculations.
