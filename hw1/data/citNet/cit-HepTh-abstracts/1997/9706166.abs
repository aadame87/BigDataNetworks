  Using numerical simulations, the stability and scattering properties of the
O(3) model on a two-dimensional torus are studied. Its solitons are found to be
unstable but can be stabilized by the addition of a Skyrme term to the
Lagrangian. Scattering at right angles with respect to the initial direction of
motion is observed in all cases considered. The model has no solutions of
degree one, so when a field configuration that resembles a soliton is
considered, it shrinks to become infinitely thin. A comparison of these results
with those of the model defined on the sphere is made.
