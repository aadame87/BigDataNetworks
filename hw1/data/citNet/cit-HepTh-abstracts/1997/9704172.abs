Title: Absorption of fixed scalars
Author: Marika Taylor-Robinson (DAMTP, University of Cambridge)

\\
  We calculate the absorption rates of fixed scalars by near extremal five
dimensional black holes carrying general one-brane and five-brane charges by
semi-classical and D-brane methods. We find that the absorption cross-sections
do not in general agree for either fixed scalar and we discuss possible
explanations of the discrepancy.
