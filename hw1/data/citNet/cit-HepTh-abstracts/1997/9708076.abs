  We apply the light-cone hamiltonian approach to D2-brane, and derive the
equivalent gauge-invariant Lagrangian. The later appears to be that of
three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, interacting with matter fields, in the
special external induced metric, depending on matter fields. The duality
between this theory and 11d membrane is shown.
