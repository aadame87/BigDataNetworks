  We formulate criteria of applicability of the Faddeev-Popov trick to gauge
theories on manifolds with boundaries. With the example of Euclidean Maxwell
theory we demonstrate that the path integral is indeed gauge independent when
these criteria are satisfied, and depends on a gauge choice whenever these
criteria are violated. In the latter case gauge dependent boundary conditions
are required for a self-consistent formulation of the path intgral.
