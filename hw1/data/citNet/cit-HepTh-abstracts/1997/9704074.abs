  We elaborate the trigonometric version of intertwining vectors and factorized
L-operators. The starting point is the corresponding elliptic construction with
Belavin's R-matrix. The naive trigonometric limit is singular and a careful
analysis is needed. It is shown that the construction admits several different
trigonometric degenerations. As a by-product, a quantum Lax operator for the
trigonometric Ruijsenaars model intertwined by a non-dynamical R-matrix is
obtained. The latter differs from the standard trigonometric R-matrix of $A_n$
type. A connection with the dynamical R-matrix approach is discussed.
