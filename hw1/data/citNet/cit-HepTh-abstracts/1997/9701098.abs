  I outline the basics of numerical solution of quantum field theory using the
Source Galerkin method. This method is based on an analysis of the functional
differential equations of a field theory in the presence of external sources.
This approach is particularly powerful because it naturally allows the
inclusion of symmetry information and avoids the fermion determinant problem
associated with Monte Carlo calculations. The technique is also suitable for
continuum calculations.
