  We consider a dimensional reduction of 3+1 dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory coupled to adjoint fermions to obtain a class of 1+1 dimensional gauge
theories. We derive the quantized light-cone Hamiltonian in the light-cone
gauge A^+ = 0$ and large-N limit, then solve for the masses, wavefunctions and
of the color singlet boson and fermion boundstates. We find that the theory has
many exact massless state that are similar to the t'Hooft pion.
