Title: String Solitons in M Theory Fivebrane : A possibility of higher order
  U(1) bundles
Authors: Kazuyuki Fujii
Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX2e
\\
  A volume form $H$ on the $n$--dimensional sphere $S^n$ is closed $(dH=0)$, so
that it is locally written as $H=dB$, where B is a $(n-1)$--form. In the first
half we give an explicit form to B and, moreover, a speculation concerning
higher order U(1) bundles. In the second half we apply our B in the case $n=3$
to a string soliton solution discussed by Perry and Schwarz.
