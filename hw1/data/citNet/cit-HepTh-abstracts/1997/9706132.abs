  This is an expanded version of the notes to a course taught by the first
author at the 1995 Les Houches Summer School. Constraints on a tentative
reconciliation of quantum theory and general relativity are reviewed. It is
explained what supersymmetric quantum theory teaches us about differential
topology and geometry. Non-commutative differential topology and geometry are
developed in some detail. As an example, the non-commutative torus is studied.
An introduction to string theory and $M$(atrix) models is provided, and it is
outlined how tools of non-commutative geometry can be used to explore the
geometry of string theory and conformal field theory.
