Title: Aspects of Superembeddings
Authors: P.S. Howe, E. Sezgin and P.C. West
Comments: 13 pages, Latex, Contribution to Supersymmetry and Quantum Field
  Theory, International Seminar dedicated to the memory of D. V. Volkov
  (Kharkov, 1997), some clarifications are made
\\
  Some aspects of the geometry of superembeddings and its application to
supersymmetric extended objects are discussed. In particular, the embeddings of
(3|16) and (6|16) dimensional superspaces into (11|32) dimensional superspace,
corresponding to supermembranes and superfivebranes in eleven dimensions, are
treated in some detail.
