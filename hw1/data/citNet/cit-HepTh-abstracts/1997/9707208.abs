  We present an additional test of the recent proposal for describing
supersymmetry breaking due to gaugino condensation in the strong coupling
regime, by a Scherk-Schwarz mechanism on the eleventh dimension of M-theory. An
analysis of supersymmetric transformations in the infinite-radius limit reveals
the presence of a discontinuity in the spinorial parameter, which coincides
with the result found in the presence of gaugino condensation. The condensate
is then identified with the quantized parameter entering the modification of
the Scherk-Schwarz boundary conditions. This mechanism provides an alternative
perturbative explanation of the gauge hierarchy that determines the scale of
low-energy supersymmetry breaking in terms of the unification gauge coupling
