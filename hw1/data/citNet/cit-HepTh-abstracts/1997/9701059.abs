Title: Hidden Symmetries of the Principal Chiral Model and a Nonstandard Loop
  Algebra
Authors: C. Devchand and Jeremy Schiff
Comments: 5 pages, latex; changed title and slight textual revisions; to be
  published in Phys. Lett. B
\\
  We examine the precise structure of the loop algebra of `dressing' symmetries
of the Principal Chiral Model, and discuss a new infinite set of abelian
symmetries of the field equations which preserve a symplectic form on the space
of solutions.
