  We present a general scheme for identifying fibrations in the framework of
toric geometry and provide a large list of weights for Calabi--Yau 4-folds. We
find 914,164 weights with degree $d\le150$ whose maximal Newton polyhedra are
reflexive and 525,572 weights with degree $d\le4000$ that give rise to weighted
projective spaces such that the polynomial defining a hypersurface of trivial
canonical class is transversal. We compute all Hodge numbers, using Batyrev's
formulas (derived by toric methods) for the first and Vafa's fomulas (obtained
by counting of Ramond ground states in N=2 LG models) for the latter class,
checking their consistency for the 109,308 weights in the overlap. Fibrations
of k-folds, including the elliptic case, manifest themselves in the N lattice
in the following simple way: The polyhedron corresponding to the fiber is a
subpolyhedron of that corresponding to the k-fold, whereas the fan determining
the base is a linear projection of the fan corresponding to the k-fold.
