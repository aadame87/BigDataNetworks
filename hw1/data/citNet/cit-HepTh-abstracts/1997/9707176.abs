  We study static, spherically symmetric, and purely magnetic solutions of
SU(2) $\times$ SU(2) gauge supergravity in four dimensions. A systematic
analysis of the supersymmetry conditions reveals solutions which preserve 1/8
of the supersymmetries and are characterized by a BPS-monopole-type gauge field
and a globally hyperbolic, everywhere regular geometry. These present the first
known example of non-Abelian backgrounds in gauge supergravity and in leading
order effective string theory.
