  In this article, we will discuss geometric quantization of 2d QCD with
fermionic and bosonic matter fields. We identify the respective large-N_c phase
spaces as the infinite dimensional Grassmannian and the infinite dimensional
Disc. The Hamiltonians are quadratic functions, and the resulting equations of
motion for these classical systems are nonlinear. In a previous publication,
the first author has shown that the linearization of the equations of motion
for the Grassmannian gave the `t Hooft equation. We will see that the
linearization in the bosonic case leads to the scalar analog of the `t Hooft
equation found by Tomaras.
