  BPS configurations of intersecting branes have many applications in string
theory. We attempt to provide an introductory and pedagogical review of
supergravity solutions corresponding to orthogonal BPS intersections of branes
with an emphasis on eleven and ten space-time dimensions. Recent work on BPS
solutions corresponding to non-orthogonally intersecting branes is also
discussed. These notes are based on lectures given at the APCTP Winter School
"Dualities of Gauge and String Theories", Korea, February 1997.
