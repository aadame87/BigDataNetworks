  Extended superalgebras of types A,B,C, heterotic and type-I are all derived
as solutions to a BPS equation in 14 dimensions with signature ( 11,3). The BPS
equation as well as the solutions are covariant under SO( 11,3). This shows how
supersymmetries with N<=8 in four dimensions have their origin in the same
superalgebra in 14D. The solutions provide different bases for the same
superalgebra in 4D, and the transformations among bases correspond to various
dualities.
