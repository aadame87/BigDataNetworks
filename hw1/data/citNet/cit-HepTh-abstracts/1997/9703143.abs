  We discuss the application of T-duality to massive supersymmetric sigma
models. In particular (1,1) supersymmetric models with off-shell central
charges reveal an interesting structure. The T-duality transformations of the
BPS states of these theories are also discussed and an explicit example of
Q-kinks is given.
