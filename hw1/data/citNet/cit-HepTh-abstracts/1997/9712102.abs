  We classify and explicitly construct the embedding diagrams of Verma modules
over the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the Virasoro algebra. The essential
ingredient of the solution consists in drawing the distinction between two
different types of submodules appearing in N=2 Verma modules. The problem is
simplified by associating to every N=2 Verma module a relaxed Verma module over
the affine algebra ^sl(2) with an isomorphic embedding diagram. We then make
use of the mechanism according to which the structure of the N=2/relaxed-sl(2)
embedding diagrams can be found knowing the standard embedding diagrams of
^sl(2) Verma modules. The resulting classification of the N=2/relaxed-^sl(2)
embedding diagrams follows the I-II-III pattern extended by an additional
indication of the number (0, 1, or 2) and the twists of the standard ^sl(2)
embedding diagrams contained in a given N=2/relaxed-^sl(2) embedding diagram.
