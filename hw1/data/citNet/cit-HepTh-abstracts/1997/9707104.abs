  Using a supergeometric interpretation of field functionals, we show that for
a class of classical field models used for realistic quantum field theoretic
models, an infinite-dimensional supermanifold (smf) of classical solutions in
Minkowski space can be constructed. That is, we show that the smf of smooth
Cauchy data with compact support is isomorphic with an smf of corresponding
classical solutions of the model.
