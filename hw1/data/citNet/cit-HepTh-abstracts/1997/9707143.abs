  We investigate gaugino condensation in the framework of the strongly coupled
heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ string (M--theory). Supersymmetry is broken in a
hidden sector and gravitational interactions induce soft breaking parameters in
the observable sector. The resulting soft masses are of order of the gravitino
mass. The situation is similar to that in the weakly coupled $E_8 \times E_8$
theory with one important difference: we avoid the problem of small gaugino
masses which are now comparable to the gravitino mass.
