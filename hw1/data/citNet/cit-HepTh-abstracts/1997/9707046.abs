Title: Generalized Dynkin diagrams and root systems and their folding
Authors: Jean-Bernard Zuber

\\
  Graphs which generalize the simple or affine Dynkin diagrams are introduced.
Each diagram defines a bilinear form on a root system and thus a reflection
group. We present some properties of these groups and of their natural "Coxeter
element". The folding of these graphs and groups is also discussed, using the
theory of C-algebras. (Proceedings of the Taniguchi Symposium {Topological
