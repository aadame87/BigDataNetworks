  We derive the (matrix-valued) Feynman rules of the mass perturbation theory
and use it for the resummation of the $n$-point functions with the help of the
Dyson-Schwinger equations. We use these results for a short review of the
complete spectrum of the model and for a discussion of scattering processes. We
find that in scattering cross sections all the resonances and higher particle
production thresholds of the model are properly taken into account by our
resummed mass perturbation theory, without the need of further approximations.
