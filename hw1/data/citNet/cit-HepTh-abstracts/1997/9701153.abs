  We construct the Euclidean on-shell action for the five-dimensional
non-extremal black hole with multiple electric charges. We show that this
thermal action agrees with one half of the entropy. This agreement is argued to
be related to the generalized Smarr formula of the five-dimensional black hole
mass. Through the calculation of the specific heat far off extremality we
observe that a phase transition occurs.
