  We discuss supersymmetric quantum mechanical models with periodic potentials.
The important new feature is that it is possible for both isospectral
potentials to support zero modes, in contrast to the standard nonperiodic case
where either one or neither (but not both) of the isospectral pair has a zero
mode. Thus it is possible to have supersymmetry unbroken and yet also have a
vanishing Witten index. We present some explicit exactly soluble examples for
which the isospectral potentials have identical band spectra, and which are
``self-isospectral'' in the sense that the potentials have identical shape, but
are translated by one half period relative to one another.
