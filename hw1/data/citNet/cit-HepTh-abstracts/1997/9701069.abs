  In these notes we attempt to give a pedagogical introduction to the work of
Seiberg and Witten on S-duality and the exact results of N=2 supersymmetric
gauge theories with and without matter. The first half is devoted to a review
of monopoles in gauge theories and the construction of supersymmetric gauge
theories. In the second half, we describe the work of Seiberg and Witten.
