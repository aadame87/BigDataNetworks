  It is shown that all the (p,q) dyon bound states exist and are unique in N=4
and N=2 with four massless flavours supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theories,
where p and q are any relatively prime integers. The proof can be understood in
the context of field theory alone, and does not rely on any duality assumption.
We also give a general physical argument showing that these theories should
have at least an exact Gamma(2) duality symmetry, and then deduce in particular
the existence of the (2p,2q) vector multiplets in the Nf=4 theory. The
corresponding massive theories are studied in parallel, and it is shown that
though in these cases the spectrum is no longer self-dual at a given point on
the moduli space, it is still in perfect agreement with an exact S duality. We
also discuss the interplay between our results and both the semiclassical
quantization and the heterotic-type II string-string duality conjecture.
