  We show that the fluxes of the various six-dimensional "gauge" theories are
associated to below threshold bound states of D-branes with the NS-5-branes and
KK-monopoles which preserve half of bulk supersymmetry. We then present the
supergravity solutions that correspond to these bound states. In addition using
the worldvolume solitons of IIA and IIB NS-5-branes and KK-monopoles, we
investigate the sectors of the "gauge" theories that preserve one quarter of
bulk supersymmetry. This leads to a generalization a supergravity solution
which has the interpretation of two intersecting NS-5-branes at a 3-brane and
to the construction of some of the worldvolume solitons of IIA and M-theory
KK-monopoles. Furthermore, using the IIA/IIB T-duality of the bulk theories, we
give the T-duality transformations of the worldvolume solitons of NS-5-branes
and KK-monopoles. We find that the worldvolume 0-brane, self-dual string and
2-brane solitons of NS-5-branes appear in the same T-duality chain.
