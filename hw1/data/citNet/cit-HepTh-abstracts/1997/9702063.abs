  The evidently supersymmetric four-dimensional Wess-Zumino model with quenched
disorder is considered at the one-loop level. The infrared fixed points of a
beta-function form the moduli space $M = RP^2$ where two types of phases were
found: with and without replica symmetry. While the former phase possesses only
a trivial fixed point, this point become unstable in the latter phase which may
be interpreted as a spin glass phase.
