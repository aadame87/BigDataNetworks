  We consider F-theory compactifications on a mirror pair of elliptic
Calabi-Yau threefolds. This yields two different six-dimensional theories, each
of them being nonperturbatively equivalent to some compactification of
heterotic strings on a K3 surface S with certain bundle data E --> S. We find
evidence for a transformation of S together with the bundle that takes one
heterotic model to the other.
