  Reflection equation for the scattering of lines moving in half-plane is
obtained. The corresponding geometric picture is related with configurations of
half-planes touching the boundary plane in 2+1 dimensions. This equation can be
obtained as an additional to the tetrahedron equation consistency condition for
a modified Zamolodchikov algebra.
