  It is pointed out that if we allow for the possibility of a multilayered
universe, it is possible to maintain exact supersymmetry and arrange, in
principle, for the vanishing of the cosmological constant. Superpartner(s) of a
known particle will then be associated with the other layers of such a
universe. A concrete model realizing this scenario is exhibited in \2
dimensions, and it is suggested that it may be realizable in 3+1 dimensions.
The connection between this nonclassical geometry and noncommutative geometries
is discussed.
