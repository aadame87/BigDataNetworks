  A universal minimal spinor set of linear differential equations describing
anyons and ordinary integer and half-integer spin fields is constructed with
the help of deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection. The construction is
generalized to some d=2+1 supersymmetric field systems. Quadratic and linear
forms of action functionals are found for the universal minimal as well as for
supersymmetric spinor sets of equations. A possibility of constructing a
universal classical mechanical model for d=2+1 spin systems is discussed.
