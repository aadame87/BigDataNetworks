  Using physical arguments (Higgs mechanism, superconductivity, infrared
regime, duality) and a geometric-topological construction (scalar curvature
distribution compatible with surgery), we propose a topological interpretation
of 3D SW theory in terms of the abelian Casson invariant. Further algebraic
reasoning shows equivalence of that invariant to the Alexander ``polynomial''.
Our starting point is a 3D version of the original SW theory. Observing that
the scalar curvature $R$ plays the role of a mass-squared parameter for the
monopole field we can use that observation to control the theory in low-energy
limit.
