  Results about the phase structure of certain N=1 supersymmetric gauge
theories, which have been obtained as a consequence of holomorphy and
`electric-magnetic' duality, are shown to be in quantitative agreement
with corresponding consequences of analyticity and superconvergence of the
gauge field propagator. This connection is of interest, because the
superconvergence arguments for confinement are not restricted to theories
with supersymmetry. The method of reduction in the space of coupling parameters
is used in order to define, beyond the matching conditions, an asymptotically
free, dual magnetic theory involving Yukawa couplings.
