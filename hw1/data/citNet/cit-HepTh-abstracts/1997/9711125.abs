  In this letter we study a coupled system of six-dimensional N=1 tensor and
super Yang-Mills multiplets. We identify some of the solitonic states of this
system which exhibit stringy behaviour in six dimensions. A discussion of the
supercharges and energy for the tensor multiplet as well as zero modes is also
given. We speculate about the possible relationship between our solution and
what is known as tensionless strings.
