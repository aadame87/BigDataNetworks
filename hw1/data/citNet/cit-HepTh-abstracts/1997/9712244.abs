  We investigate a lattice version of QED by numerical simulations. For the
renormalized charge and mass we find results which are consistent with the
renormalized charge vanishing in the continuum limit. A detailed study of the
relation between bare and renormalized quantities reveals that the Landau pole
lies in a region of parameter space which is made inaccessible by spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking.
