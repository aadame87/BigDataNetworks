  We use the microscopic instanton calculus to determine the one-instanton
contribution to the quantum modulus u_3=<Tr(\phi^3)> in N=2 SU(N_c)
supersymmetric QCD with N_f<2N_c fundamental flavors. This is compared with the
corresponding prediction of the hyperelliptic curves which are expected to give
exact solutions in this theory. The results agree up to certain regular terms
which appear when N_f\geq 2N_c-3. The curve prediction for these terms depends
upon the curve parameterization which is generically ambiguous when N_f\geq
N_c. In SU(3) theory our instanton calculation of the regular terms is found to
disagree with the predictions of all of the suggested curves. For this theory
we employ our results as input to improve the curve parameterization for
N_f=3,4,5.
