  We re-examine the OSp(N,4) invariant interacting model of massless chiral and
gauge superfields, whose superconformal invariance was instrumental, both in
proving the all-order no-renormalization of the mass and chiral
self-interaction lagrangians, and in determining the linear superfield
renormalization needed. We show that the renormalization of the gravitational
action modifies only the cosmological term, without affecting higher-order
tensors. This could explain why the effect of the cosmological constant is
shadowed by the effects of newtonian gravity.
