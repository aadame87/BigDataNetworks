  We propose examples, which involve orbifolds by elements of the U-duality
group, with M-theory moduli fixed at the eleven-dimensional Planck scale. We
begin by reviewing asymmetric orbifold constructions in perturbative string
theory, which fix radial moduli at the string scale. Then we consider
non-perturbative aspects of those backgrounds (brane probes and the orbifold
action from the eleven-dimensional point of view). This leads us to consider
mutually non-perturbative group actions. Using a combination of dualities,
matrix theory, and ideas for the generalization of the perturbative orbifold
prescription, we present evidence that the examples we construct are consistent
M-theory backgrounds. In particular we argue that there should be consistent
non-supersymmetric compactifications of M-theory.
