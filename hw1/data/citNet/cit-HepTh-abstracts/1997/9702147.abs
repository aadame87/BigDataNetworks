  A systematic consideration of the problem of the reduction and extension of
the structure group of a principal bundle is made and a variety of techniques
in each case are explored and related to one another. We apply these to the
study of the Dixmier-Douady class in various contexts including string
structures, U-res bundles and other examples motivated by considerations from
quantum field theory.
