  The general, linear equations with constant coefficients on quantum Minkowski
spaces are considered and the explicit formulae for their conserved currents
are given. The proposed procedure can be simplified for *-invariant equations.
The derived method is then applied to Klein-Gordon, Dirac and wave equations on
different classes of Minkowski spaces. In the examples also symmetry operators
for these equations are obtained. They include quantum deformations of
classical symmetry operators as well as an additional operator connected with
deformation of the Leibnitz rule in non-commutative differential calculus.
