  We propose a new model of inflation based on the soft-breaking of N=2
supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. The advantage of such a model is the
fact that we can write an exact expression for the effective scalar potential,
including non-perturbative effects, which preserves the analyticity and duality
properties of the Seiberg-Witten solution. We find that the scalar condensate
that plays the role of the inflaton can drive a long period of cosmological
expansion, produce the right amount of temperature anisotropies in the
microwave background, and end inflation when the monopole acquires a vacuum
expectation value. Duality properties relate the weak coupling Higgs region
where inflation takes place with the strong coupling monopole region, where
reheating occurs, creating particles corresponding to the light degrees of
freedom in the true vacuum.
