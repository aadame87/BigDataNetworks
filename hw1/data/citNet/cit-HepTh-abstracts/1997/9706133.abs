  An algebraic cohomological characterization of a class of linearly broken
Ward identities is provided. The examples of the topological vector
supersymmetry and of the Landau ghost equation are discussed in detail. The
existence of such a linearly broken Ward identities turns out to be related to
BRST exact antifield dependent cocycles with negative ghost number.
