  We construct Calabi-Yau manifolds and their mirrors from K3 surfaces. This
method was first developed by Borcea and Voisin. We examined their properties
torically and checked mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau 4-fold case. From
Borcea-Voisin 3-fold or 4-fold examples, it may be possible to probe the
S-duality of Seiberg -Witten.
