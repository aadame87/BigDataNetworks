Title: A black hole in two-dimensional space-time
Authors: F. Vendrell

  An imploding shell of radiation is shown to create a 2-D black hole within
the framework of the ``R=T'' theory. The radius of the horizon is given by
1/(2M), where M is the mass of the black hole. The topology of the central
singularity is that of a corner. The radiation emitted very far from the black
hole is thermal with temperature M/(2\pi). The back-reaction problem is solved
to one-loop order.
