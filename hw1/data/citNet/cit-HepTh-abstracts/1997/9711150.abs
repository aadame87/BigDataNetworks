  We construct an RG potential for N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory,
and extract a positive definite metric by comparing its gradient with the
recently discovered beta-function for this system, thus proving that the RG
flow is gradient in this four-dimensional field theory. We also discuss how
this flow might change after supersymmetry breaking, provided the quantum
symmetry group does not, emphasizing the non-trivial problem of asymptotic
matching of automorphic functions to perturbation theory.
