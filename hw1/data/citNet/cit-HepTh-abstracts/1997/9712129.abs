  We generalize to the case of compactified superstrings a construction given
previously for critical superstrings of finite one loop amplitudes that are
well-defined for all external momenta. The novel issues that arise for
compactified strings are the appearance of infrared divergences from the
propagation of massless strings in four dimensions and, in the case of orbifold
schemes, the contribution of tachyons in partial amplitudes with given spin
structure and twist sectors. Methods are presented for the resolution of these
problems and expressions for finite amplitudes are given in terms of double and
single dispersion relations, with explicit spectral densities.
