  Classical solutions of the self-interacting, non-abelian antisymmetric tensor
gauge theory of Freedman and Townsend coupled to Einstein gravity is discussed.
Particularly, it is demonstrated that the theory admits a classical metric
solution which, depending on the value of the gauge coupling parameter of the
theory, exhibits a black hole with an exotic non-abelian hair or a spacetime
showing the ``violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis'' which should be
distinguished from white holes.
