  The monopole confinement mechanism in the abelian projection of lattice
gluodynamics is reviewed. The main topics are: the abelian projection on the
lattice and in the continuum, a numerical study of the abelian monopoles in the
lattice gauge theory. Additionally, we briefly review the notation of
differential forms, duality, and the BKT transformation in the lattice gauge
theories.
