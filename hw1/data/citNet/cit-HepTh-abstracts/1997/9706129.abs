  We calculate the heat-kernel coefficients, up to $a_2$, for a U(1) bundle on
the 4-Ball for boundary conditions which are such that the normal derivative of
the field at the boundary is related to a first-order operator in boundary
derivatives acting on the field. The results are used to place restrictions on
the general forms of the coefficients. In the specific case considered, there
can be a breakdown of ellipticity.
