  An exactly soluble non-perturbative model of the pure gauge QCD is derived as
a weak coupling limit of the lattice theory in plaquette formulation. The model
represents QCD as a theory of the weakly interacting field strength fluxes. The
area law behavior of the Wilson loop average is a direct result of this
representation: the total flux through macroscopic loop is the additive (due to
the weakness of the interaction) function of the elementary fluxes. The
compactness of the gauge group is shown to be the factor which prevents the
elementary fluxes contributions from cancellation. There is no area law in the
non-compact theory.
