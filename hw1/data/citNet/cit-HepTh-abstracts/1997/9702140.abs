  To produce an isomorphism between the light-cone and equal-time
representations some additional formalism beyond that originally proposed for
the light-cone representation may sometimes be required. The additional
formalism usually involves zero modes and is most likely to affect delicate,
high energy aspects of the solution such as condensates. In this talk I will
review some of the information which has been obtained in the past few years on
these issues with particular emphasis on the Schwinger model as an example.
