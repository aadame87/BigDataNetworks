  We show that the vacuum functional of 3+1 dimensional non-abelian gauge
theories vanishes for some classical field configurations $\psi_0(A)=0$ when
the coefficient of the CP violating $\theta$--term becomes $\theta=\pi$ (mod.
$2\pi$). Some of these classical configurations are explicitly identified and
include sphalerons. The results shed new light into the non-perturbative
behavior of non-abelian gauge theories and suggest a relevant role for these
classical configurations in the confinement mechanism at $\theta=0$.
