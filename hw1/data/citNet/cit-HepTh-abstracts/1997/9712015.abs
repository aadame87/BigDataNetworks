  The reduction of 4D Einstein gravity with $N$ minimal scalars leads to
specific 2D dilaton gravity with dilaton coupled scalars. Applying s-wave and
large $N$ approximation (where large $N$ quantum contribution due to dilaton
itself is taken into account) we study 2D cosmology for CGHS model and for
reduced Einstein gravity (in both cases with dilaton coupled scalars).
Numerical study shows that in most cases we get 2D singular Universe which may
correspond to big bang. Nevertheless, big crunch or non-singular Universes are
also possible. For reduced 4D Einstein gravity one can regard the obtained 2D
cosmology with time-dependent dilaton as 4D Kantowski-Sacks Universe of
singular,non-singular or big crunch type.
