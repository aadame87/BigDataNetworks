  We study the configuration of a typical highly excited string as one slowly
increases the string coupling. The dominant interactions are the long range
dilaton and gravitational attraction. In four spacetime dimensions, the string
slowly contracts from its initial (large) size until it approaches the string
scale where it forms a black hole. In higher dimensions, the string stays large
until the coupling reaches a critical value, and then it rapidly collapses to a
black hole. The implications for the recently proposed correspondence principle
are discussed.
