Title: The Self-Dual String Soliton
Authors: P.S. Howe, N.D. Lambert and P.C. West
Comments: 21 pages phyzzx. The discussion of the supersymmetry transformations
  and the fivebrane equations of motion has been significantly extended. Some
  references have been added. The results are the same as the previous version

  We obtain a BPS soliton of the M theory fivebrane's equations of motion
representing a supersymmetric self-dual string. The resulting solution is then
dimensionally reduced and used to obtain 0-brane and (p-2)-brane solitons on
D-p-branes.
