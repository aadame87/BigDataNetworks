  Anyon gas with interparticle (retarded) Coulomb interaction has been studied.
The resulting system is shown to be a collection of dressed anyons, with a
screening factor introduced in their spin. Close structural similarity with the
Chern-Simons construction of anyons has helped considerably in computing the
screening effect. Finally the present model is compared with the conventional
Chern-Simons construction.
