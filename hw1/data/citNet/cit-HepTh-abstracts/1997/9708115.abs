  Massless Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of SU(N_c) are
expected to screen gauge interactions in 1+1 dimensions, analogous to a similar
Higgs phenomena known for 1+1-dimensional U(1) gauge theory with massless
fundamental fermions (Schwinger model). Using the light-cone formalism and
large-N_c limit, a non-abelian analogue of the Schwinger boson is shown to be
responsible for the screening between heavy test charges. This adjoint boson
does not exist simply as a physical state, but boundstates are built entirely
from this particle.
