  Modified similarity renormalization of Hamiltonians is proposed, that
performes by means of flow equations the similarity transformation of
Hamiltonian in the particle number space. This enables to renormalize in the
energy space the field theoretical Hamiltonian and makes possible to work in a
severe trancated Fock space for the renormalized Hamiltonian.
