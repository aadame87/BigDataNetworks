Title: Gyros as geometry of the standard model

  We investigate the (noncommutative) geometry defined by the standard model,
which turns out to be of Kaluza-Klein type. We find that spacetime points are
replaced by extended two-dimensional objects which resemble the surface of a
gyro. Their size is of the order of the inverse top quark mass.
