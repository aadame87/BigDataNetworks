  The gauged SL(2,R)/U(1) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model is
classically an integrable conformal field theory. We have found a Lax pair
representation for the non-linear equations of motion, and a B"acklund
transformation. A second-order differential equation of the Gelfand-Dikii type
defines the Poisson bracket structure of the theory, and its fundamental
solutions describe the general solution of the WZNW model as well. The physical
and free fields are related by non-local transformations. The (anti-)chiral
component of the energy-momentum tensor which factorizes into conserved
quantities satisfying a non-linear algebra characteristic for parafermions
assumes the expected canonical free field form. So the black hole model seems
to be prepared for an exact canonical quantization.
