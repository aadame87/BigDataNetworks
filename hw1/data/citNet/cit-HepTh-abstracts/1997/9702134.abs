  We present the newly improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) Hamiltonian
formalism and the generalization to the Lagrangian formulation, which provide
the much more simple and transparent insight to the usual BFT method, with
application to the non-Abelian Proca model which has been an difficult problem
in the usual BFT method. The infinite terms of the effectively first class
constraints can be made to be the regular power series forms by ingenious
choice of $X_{\alpha \beta}$ and $\omega^{\alpha \beta}$-matrices. In this new
method, the first class Hamiltonian, which also needs infinite correction terms
is obtained simply by replacing the original variables in the original
Hamiltonian with the BFT physical variables. Remarkably all the infinite
correction terms can be expressed in the compact exponential form. We also show
that in our model the Poisson brackets of the BFT physical variables in the
extended phase space are the same structure as the Dirac brackets of the
original phase space variables. With the help of both our newly developed
Lagrangian formulation and Hamilton's equations of motion, we obtain the
desired classical Lagrangian corresponding to the first class Hamiltonian which
can be reduced to the generalized St\"uckelberg Lagrangian which is non-trivial
conjecture in our infinitely many terms involved in Hamiltonian and Lagrangian.
