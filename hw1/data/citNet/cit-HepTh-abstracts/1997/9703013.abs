Title: Assumption of nonvanishingness of vacuum expectation of the scalar field
  for spontaneous symmetry breaking is superfluous
Authors: Yu Shi
Comments: Revtex, 6 pages, a revised version
\\
  For spontaneous breaking of global or gauge symmetry, it is superfluous to
assume that the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field manifesting the
symmetry is nonvanishing. The vacuum with spontaneous symmetry breaking simply
corresponds to nonzero number of particles of one or more components of the
real scalar field.
