  We study the relationship between M theory on a nearly lightlike circle and
U(N) gauge theory in p+1 dimensions. We define large N limits of these theories
in which low energy supergravity is valid. The regularity of these limits
implies an infinite series of nonrenormalization theorems for the gauge theory
effective action, and the leading large N terms sum to a Born-Infeld form.
Compatibility of two different large N limits that describe the same
decompactified M theory leads to a conjecture for a relation between two limits
of string theories.
