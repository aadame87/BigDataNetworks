  We consider the Dirac equation in cylindrically symmetric magnetic fields and
find its normal modes as eigenfunctions of a complete set of commuting
operators. This set consists of the Dirac operator itself, the $z$-components
of the linear and the total angular momenta, and of one of the possible spin
polarization operators. The spin structure of the solution is completely fixed
independently of the radial distribution of the magnetic field which influences
only the radial modes. We solve explicitly the radial equations for the uniform
magnetic field inside a solenoid of a finite radius and consider in detail the
scattering of scalar and Dirac particles in this field. For particles with low
energy the scattering cross section coincides with the Aharonov-Bohm scattering
cross section. We work out the first order corrections to this result caused by
the fact that the solenoid radius is finite. At high energies we obtain the
classical result for the scattering cross section.
