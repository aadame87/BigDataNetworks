  We analyze the vacuum structure of N=2, SU(2) QCD with massive quark
hypermultiplets, once supersymmetry is softly broken down to N=0 with dilaton
and mass spurions. We give general expressions for the low energy couplings of
the effective potential in terms of elliptic functions to have a complete
numerical control of the model. We study in detail the possible phases of the
theories with Nf = 1, 2 flavors for different values of the bare quark masses
and the supersymmetry breaking parameters and we find a rich structure of first
order phase transitions. The chiral symmetry breaking pattern of the Nf = 2
theory is considered, and we obtain the pion Lagrangian for this model up to
two derivatives. Exact expressions are given for the pion masses and the pion
decay constant in terms of the magnetic monopole description of chiral symmetry
breaking.
