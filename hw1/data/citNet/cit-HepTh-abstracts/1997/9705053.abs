  We calculate the one loop effective action for D-brane probes moving in the
presence of near BPS D-branes. The $v^2$ term agrees with supergravity in all
cases and the static force agrees for a five dimensional black hole with two
large charges. It also agrees qualitatively in all the other cases. We make
some comments on the M(atrix) theory interpretation of these results.
