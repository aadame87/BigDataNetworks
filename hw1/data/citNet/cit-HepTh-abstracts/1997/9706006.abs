  Based on a class of exactly solvable models of interacting bose and fermi
liquids, we compute the single-particle propagators of these systems exactly
for all wavelengths and energies and in any number of spatial dimensions. The
field operators are expressed in terms of bose fields that correspond to
displacements of the condensate in the bose case and displacements of the fermi
sea in the fermi case.
 Unlike some of the previous attempts, the present attempt reduces the answer
for the spectral function in any dimension in both fermi and bose systems to
quadratures.
 It is shown that when only the lowest order sea-displacement terms are
included, the random phase approximation in its many guises is recovered in the
fermi case, and Bogoliubov's theory in the bose case. The momentum distribution
is evaluated using two different approaches, exact diagonalisation and the
equation of motion approach.
 The novelty being of course, the exact computation of single-particle
properties including short wavelength behaviour.
