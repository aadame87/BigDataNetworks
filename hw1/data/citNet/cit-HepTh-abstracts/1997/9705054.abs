  A black hole solution to low energy type IIA string theory which is extremal,
non-supersymmetric, and carries 0- and 6-brane charge is presented. For large
values of the charges it is metastable and a corresponding D-brane picture can
be found. The mass and statistical entropy of the two descriptions agree at a
correspondence point up to factors of order one, providing more evidence that
the correspondence principle for black holes and strings of Horowitz and
Polchinski may be extended to include black holes with more than one
Ramond-Ramond charge.
