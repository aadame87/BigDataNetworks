  We investigate topological properties of Calabi-Yau fourfolds and consider a
wide class of explicit constructions in weighted projective spaces and, more
generally, toric varieties. Divisors which lead to a non-perturbative
superpotential in the effective theory have a very simple description in the
toric construction. Relevant properties of them follow just by counting lattice
points and can be also used to construct examples with negative Euler number.
We study nets of transitions between cases with generically smooth elliptic
fibres and cases with ADE gauge symmetries in the N=1 theory due to
degenerations of the fibre over codimension one loci in the base. Finally we
investigate the quantum cohomology ring of this fourfolds using Frobenius
algebras.
