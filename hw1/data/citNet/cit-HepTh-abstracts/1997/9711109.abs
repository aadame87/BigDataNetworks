  Different BPS M-brane configurations including single and two parallel
M$p$-branes ($p$= even) and M5-branes are introduced as the classical solutions
of the recently proposed Static Matrix Model. Also the long range interactions
of two relatively rotated M$p$-branes (one and two angles) and
M$p$-brane--anti-M$p$-brane are calculated. The results are in agreement with
11 dimensional supergravity results.
