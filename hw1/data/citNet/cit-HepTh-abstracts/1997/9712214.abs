  In the strong-coupling limit of the heterotic string theory constructed by
Horava and Witten, an 11-dimensional supergravity theory is coupled to matter
multiplets confined to 10-dimensional mirror planes. This structure suggests
that realistic unification models are obtained, after compactification of 6
dimensions, as theories of 5-dimensional supergravity in an interval, coupling
to matter fields on 4-dimensional walls. Supersymmetry breaking may be
communicated from one boundary to another by the 5-dimensional fields. In this
paper, we study a toy model of this communication in which 5-dimensional
super-Yang-Mills theory in the bulk couples to chiral multiplets on the walls.
Using the auxiliary fields of the Yang-Mills multiplet, we find a simple
algorithm for coupling the bulk and boundary fields. We demonstrate two
different mechanisms for generating soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the
boundary theory. We also compute the Casimir energy generated by supersymmetry
breaking.
