  The anti-BRST transformation, in its Sp(2)-symmetric version, for the general
case of any stage-reducible gauge theories is implemented in the usual BV
approach. This task is accomplished not by duplicating the gauge symmetries but
rather by duplicating all fields and antifields of the theory and by imposing
the acyclicity of the Koszul-Tate differential. In this way the Sp(2)-covariant
quantization can be realised in the standard BV approach and its equivalence
with BLT quantization can be proven by a special gauge fixing procedure.
