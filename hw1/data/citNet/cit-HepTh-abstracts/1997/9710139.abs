Title: The Meaning of Maximal Symmetry in Presence of Torsion
Authors: Debashis Gangopadhyay and Soumitra Sengupta
Comments: latex, 12 pages
\\
  We show that the usual physical meaning of maximal symmetry can be made to
remain unaltered even if torsion is present. All that is required is that the
torsion fields satisfy some mutually consistent constraints. We also give an
explicit realisation of such a scenario by determining the torsion fields, the
metric and the associated Killing vectors.
