  Kraemmer and Rebhan claimed the gauge independence of the conformal anomaly
of bosonic string for various gauge fixings in the framework of the
perturbation theory of two-dimensional quantum gravity. It is pointed out that
their proof is wrong. The gauge independence is proved for the gauge-fixings
which reduce to the linearized de Donder gauge in the flat limit of the
background metric. Similar remarks are made also for the Rebhan-Kraemmer
current anomaly.
