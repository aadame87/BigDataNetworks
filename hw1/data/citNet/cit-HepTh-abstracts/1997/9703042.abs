  We investigate quantum dynamics of self-gravitating spherical dust shell. The
wave functions of discrete spectrum are not localized inside the Schwarzschild
radius. We argue that such shells can transform into white holes (in another
space). It is plausible that shells with bare masses larger than the Planck
mass loose their mass emitting lighter shells.
