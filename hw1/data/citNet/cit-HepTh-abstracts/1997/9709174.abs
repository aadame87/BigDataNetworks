  We show that a large class of supersymmetric solutions to the low-energy
effective field theory of heterotic string theory compactified on a seven torus
can have finite energy, which we compute. The mechanism by which these
solutions are turned into finite energy solutions is similar to the one
occurring in the context of four-dimensional stringy cosmic string solutions.
We also describe the solutions in terms of intersecting eleven-dimensional
M-branes, M-waves and M-monopoles.
