  Gauge theories are formulated on the noncommutative two-sphere. These
theories have only finite number of degrees of freedom, nevertheless they
exhibit both the gauge symmetry and the SU(2) "Poincar\'e" symmetry of the
sphere. In particular, the coupling of gauge fields to chiral fermions is
naturally achieved.
