  Two dimensional QCD is bosonized to be an integrably deformed
Wess-Zumino-Witten model under proper limit. Fermions are identified having
indices of the Grassmann manifold. Conditions for integrability are analyzed
and their physical meanings are discussed. We also address the nature of the
exactly solvable part of the theory and find the infinitely many conserved
quantities.
