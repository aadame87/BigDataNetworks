  A rectangular Wilson loop with sides parallel to space and time directions is
perturbatively evaluated in two light-cone gauge formulations of Yang-Mills
theory in 1+1 dimensions, with ``instantaneous'' and ``causal'' interactions
between static quarks. In the instantaneous formulation we get Abelian-like
exponentiation of the area in terms of $C_F$. In the ``causal'' formulation the
loop depends not only on the area, but also on the dimensionless ratio $\beta =
{L \over T}$, $2L$ and $2T$ being the lengths of the rectangular sides. Besides
it also exhibits dependence on $C_A$. In the limit $T \to \infty$ the area law
is recovered, but dependence on $C_A$ survives. Consequences of these results
are pointed out.
