  We derive an exact equation of motion for a non-relativistic vortex in two-
and three-dimensional models with a complex field. The velocity is given in
terms of gradients of the complex field at the vortex position. We discuss the
problem of reducing the field dynamics to a closed dynamical system with
non-locally interacting strings as the fundamental degrees of freedom.
