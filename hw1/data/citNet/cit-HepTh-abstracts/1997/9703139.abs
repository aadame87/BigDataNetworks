  We use a unitary operator constructed in earlier work to transform the
Hamiltonian for QCD in the temporal ($A_0=0$) gauge into a representation in
which the quark field is gauge-invariant, and its elementary excitations --
quark and antiquark creation and annihilation operators -- implement Gauss's
law. In that representation, the interactions between gauge-dependent parts of
the gauge field and the spinor (quark) field have been transformed away and
replaced by long-range non-local interactions of quark color charge densities.
These long-range interactions connect SU(3) color charge densities through an
infinite chain of gauge-invariant gauge fields either to other SU(3) color
charge densities, or to a gluon "anchor". We discuss possible implications of
this formalism for low-energy processes, including confinement of quarks that
are not in color singlet configurations.
