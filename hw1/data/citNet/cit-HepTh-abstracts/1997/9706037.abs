  We study universality properties of the Weingarten hyper-cubic random
surfaces. Since a long time ago the model with a local restriction forbidding
surface self-bendings has been thought to be in a different universality class
from the unrestricted model defined on the full set of surfaces. We show that
both models in fact belong to the same universality class with the entropy
exponent gamma = 1/2 and differ by finite size effects which are much more
pronounced in the restricted model.
