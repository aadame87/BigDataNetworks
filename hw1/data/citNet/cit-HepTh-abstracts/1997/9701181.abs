Title: On ``Effective potential for a covariantly constant gauge field in
  curved spacetime''
Authors: Frank Antonsen, Karsten Bormann
Comments: standard LaTeX, 4 pages
\\
  We extend recent work by Elizalde et al. to incorporate curvatures which are
not small and backgrounds which are not just $S^2\times R^2, S^1\times S^1
\times R^2$. Some possible problems in their paper is also pointed out.
