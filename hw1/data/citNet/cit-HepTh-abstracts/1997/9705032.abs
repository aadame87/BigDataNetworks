  This manuscript was published as a JINR Preprint E17-10550 in 1977. In view
of the recent interest in various new kinds of statistics it seems the results
it contains may be still of some interest. It is shown that the second
quantization axioms can, in principle, be satisfied with creation and
annihilation operators generating (in the case of $n$ pairs of such operators)
the Lie algebra $A_n$ of the group $SL(n+1)$. A concept of a Fock space is
introduced. The matrix elements of these operators are found.
