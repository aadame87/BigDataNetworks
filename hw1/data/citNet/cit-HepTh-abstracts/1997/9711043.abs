  It is known that the M-branes of M-theory correspond to p-form charges in the
D=11 spacetime supersymmetry algebra. Here we show that their intersections are
encoded in the p-form charges of their worldvolume supersymmetry algebras.
Triple intersections are encoded in double intersection worldvolume algebras
with eight supercharges.
