  A recursive formula for an infinity of integrals of motion for the
super-Liouville theory is derived. The integrable boundary interactions for
this theory and the super-Toda theory based on the affine superalgebra $B^{(1)}
(0,1)$ are computed. In the first case the boundary interactions are
unambiguously determined by supersymmetry, whilst in the latter case there are
free parameters.
