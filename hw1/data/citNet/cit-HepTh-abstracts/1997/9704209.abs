  A general field-antifield BV formalism for antisymplectic first class
constraints is proposed. It is as general as the corresponding symplectic
BFV-BRST formulation and it is demonstrated to be consistent with a previously
proposed formalism for antisymplectic second class constraints through a
generalized conversion to corresponding first class constraints. Thereby the
basic concept of gauge symmetry is extended to apply to quite a new class of
gauge theories potentially possible to exist.
