  Using the results of the calculation of the one-loop effective action (E.
Elizalde et al , Phys.Rev. D49 (1994) 2852), we find the trace anomaly for most
general conformally invariant 2D dilaton coupled scalar-dilaton system (the
contribution of dilaton itself is included). The non-local effective action
induced by conformal anomaly for such system is found. That opens new
possibilities in generalizing of CGHS-like model for the study of back reaction
of matter to 2D black holes.
