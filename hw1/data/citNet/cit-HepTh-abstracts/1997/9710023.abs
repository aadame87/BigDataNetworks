  We propose a four-point effective action for the graviton, antisymmetric
two-forms, dilaton and axion of type IIB superstring in ten dimensions. It is
explicitly SL(2,Z)-invariant and reproduces the known tree-level results.
Perturbatively, it has only one-loop corrections for the NS-NS sector,
generalizing the non-renormalization theorem of the R^4 term. Finally, the
non-perturbative corrections are of the expected form, namely, they can be
interpreted as arising from single D-instantons of multiple charge.
