  We find the exact non-perturbative expression for a simple Wilson loop of
arbitrary shape for U(N) and SU(N) Euclidean or Minkowskian two-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory regulated by the Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt gauge prescription.
The result differs from the standard pure exponential area-law of YM_2, but
still exhibits confinement as well as invariance under area-preserving
diffeomorphisms and generalized axial gauge transformations. We show that the
large N limit is NOT a good approximation to the model at finite N and conclude
that Wu's N=infinity Bethe-Salpeter equation for QCD_2 should have no bound
state solutions. The main significance of our results derives from the
importance of the Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription in higher-dimensional
perturbative gauge theory.
