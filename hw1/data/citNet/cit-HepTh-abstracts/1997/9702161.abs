  The construction of new hyper-Kaehler manifolds by taking the infinite
monopole mass limit of certain Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield monopole moduli
spaces is considered. The one-parameter family of hyperkaehler manifolds due to
Dancer is shown to be an example of such manifolds. A new family of fixed
monopole spaces is constructed. They are the moduli spaces of four SU(4)
monopoles, in the infinite mass limit of two of the monopoles. These manifolds
are shown to be nonsingular when the fixed monopole positions are distinct.
