  We started from computer experiments with simple one-dimensional ergodic
dynamical systems called interval exchange transformations. Correlators in
these systems decay as a power of time. In the simplest non-trivial case the
exponent is equal to 1/3. We found a formula connecting characteristic
exponents with explicit integrals over moduli spaces of algebraic curves with
additional structures. Moreover, these integrals can be interpreted as
correlators in a topological string theory. Also a new analogy arose between
ergodic theory and complex algebraic geometry.
