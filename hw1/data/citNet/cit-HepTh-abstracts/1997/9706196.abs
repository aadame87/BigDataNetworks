  We study the effective actions of various brane configurations in Matrix
theory. Starting from the 0+1 dimensional quantum mechanics, we replace
coordinate matrices by covariant derivatives in the large N limit, thereby
obtaining effective field theories on the brane world volumes. Even for
noncompact branes, these effective theories are of Yang-Mills type, with
constant background magnetic fields. In the case of a D2-brane, we show
explicitly how the effective action equals the large magnetic field limit of
the Born-Infeld action, and thus derive from Matrix theory the action used by
Polchinski and Pouliot to compute M-momentum transfer between membranes. We
also consider the effect of compactifying transverse directions. Finally, we
analyze a scattering process involving a recently proposed background
representing a classically stable D6+D0 brane configuration. We compute the
potential between this configuration and a D0-brane, and show that the result
agrees with supergravity.
