  We argue that black p-branes will occur in the collision of D0-branes at
Planckian energies. This extents the Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano and 't
Hooft conjecture that black holes occur in the collision of two light particles
at Planckian energies. We discuss a possible scenario for such a process by
using colliding plane gravitational waves. D-branes in the presence of black
holes are discussed. M(atrix) theory and matrix string in curved space are
considered. A violation of quantum coherence in M(atrix) theory is noticed.
