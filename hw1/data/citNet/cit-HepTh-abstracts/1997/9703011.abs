  I review recent work on the infrared structure of (2+1)-dimensional Abelian
gauge theories and their application to condensed matter physics. In
particular, within a large-N Schwinger-Dyson treatment, and including an
`infrared momentum cut-off', I demonstrate the existence of a non-trivial
infrared fixed point of the renormalization group. I connect this property to
non-fermi liquid low-energy behaviour, and I attempt to draw some conclusions
about the possible application of this approach to an understanding of the
normal and superconducting phases of planar high-temperature superconducting
cuprates.
