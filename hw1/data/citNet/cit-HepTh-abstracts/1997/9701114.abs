  We have studied the kinetics of $q$-deformed bosons and fermions, within a
semiclassical approach. This investigation is realized by introducing a
generalized exclusion-inclusion principle, intrinsically connected with the
quantum $q$-algebra by means of the creation and annihilation operators matrix
elements. In this framework, we have derived a non-linear Fokker-Planck
equation for $q$-deformed bosons and fermions which can be seen as a time
evolution equation, appropriate to consider non-equilibrium or near-equilibrium
systems in a semiclassical approximation. The steady state of this equation
reproduces in a simple mode the $q$-oscillators equilibrium statistics.
