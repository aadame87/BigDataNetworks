  We propose doubly supersymmetric actions in terms of n=2(D-2) worldline
superfields for N=2 superparticles in D=3,4 and Type IIA D=6 superspaces. These
actions are obtained by dimensional reduction of superfield actions for N=1
superparticles in D=4,6 and 10, respectively. We show that in all these models
geometrodynamical constraints on target superspace coordinates do not put the
theory on the mass shell, so the actions constructed consistently describe the
dynamics of the corresponding N=2 superparticles. We also find that in contrast
to the IIA D=6 superparticle a chiral IIB D=6 superparticle, which is not
obtainable by dimensional reduction from N=1, D=10, is described by superfield
constraints which produce dynamical equations. This implies that for the IIB
D=6 superparticle the doubly supersymmetric action does not exist in the
conventional form.
