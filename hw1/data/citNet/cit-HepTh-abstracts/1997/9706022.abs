  Since the spin of real particles is of order of $\hbar$, it is difficult to
distinguish in a quantum mechanical experiment involving spinning particles
what part of the outcome is related to the spin contribution and what part is a
pure quantum mechanical effect. We analyze in detail a classical model of a
nonrelativistic spinning particle under the action of a potential barrier and
compute numerically the crossing for different potentials. In this way it is
shown that because of the spin structure there is a nonvanishing contribution
to crossing for energies above a certain minimum value, even below the top of
the potential barrier. Results are compared with the quantum tunnel effect.
