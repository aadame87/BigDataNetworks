  Explicit computations of the partition function and correlation functions of
Wilson and Polyakov loop operators in theta-sectors of two dimensional
Yang-Mills theory on the line cylinder and torus are presented. Several
observations about the correspondence of two dimensional Yang-Mills theory with
unitary matrix quantum mechanics are presented. The incorporation of the
theta-angle which characterizes the states of two dimensional adjoint QCD is
discussed.
