  We use the boundary state formalism to study the interaction of two moving
identical D-branes in the Type II superstring theory compactified on orbifolds.
By computing the velocity dependence of the amplitude in the limit of large
separation we can identify the nature of the different forces between the
branes. In particular, in the Z_3 orbifold case we find a boundary state
which is coupled only to the N=2 graviton multiplet containing just a graviton
and a vector like in the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m configuration. We also
discuss other cases including $T_4/Z_2$.
