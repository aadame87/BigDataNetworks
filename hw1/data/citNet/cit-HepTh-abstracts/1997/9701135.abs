  Manifestly covariant formulation of discrete-spin, real-mass unitary
representations of the Poincar\'e group is given. We begin with a field of
spin-frames associated with 4-mometa p and use them to simplify the eigenvalue
problem for the Pauli-Lubanski vector projection in a direction given by a
world-vector t. As opposed to the standard treatments where t is a constant
time direction, our t is in general p-dependent and timelike, spacelike or
null. The corresponding eigenstates play a role of a basis used to define
Bargmann-Wigner spinors which form a carrier space of the unitary
representation. The construction does not use the Wigner-Mackey induction
procedure, is manifestly covariant and works simultaneously in both massive and
massless cases (in on- and off-shell versions). Of particular interest are
special Bargmann-Wigner spinors ($\omega$-spinors) associated with flag pole
directions of the spin-frame field $\omega_A(p)$.
