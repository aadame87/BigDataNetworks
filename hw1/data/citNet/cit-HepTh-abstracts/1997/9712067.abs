  In (3+1) Hamiltonian form, the conditions for the electric/magnetic
invariance of generic self-interacting gauge vector actions and the definition
of the duality generator are obvious. Instead, (3+1) actions are not
intrinsically Lorentz invariant. Imposing the Dirac-Schwinger stress tensor
commutator requirement to enforce the latter yields a differential constraint
on the Hamiltonian which translates into the usual Lagrangian form of the
duality invariance condition obeyed by Maxwell and Born-Infeld theories. We
also discuss covariance properties of some analogous scalar models.
