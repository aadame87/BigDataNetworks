  We imagine the strings on the stretched horizon of any $d$ space-time
dimensional black hole to be bits of polymer. Then, proposing an interaction
between these bits we obtain the size of the configuration, and thus of the
black hole, using the scaling laws. The transition from a typical black hole
state to a typical string state has a simple explanation, which also holds for
the extremal black holes.
