  N=1, d=4 superconformal group is studied and its representations are
discussed. Under superconformal transformations, left invariant derivatives and
some class of superfields, including supercurrents, are shown to follow these
representations. In other words, these superfields are quasi-primary by analogy
with two dimensional conformal field theory. Based on these results, we find
the general forms of the two-point and the three-point correlation functions of
the quasi-primary superfields in a group theoretical way. In particular, we
show that the two-point function of the supercurrent is unique up to a constant
and the general form of the three-point function of the supercurrent has two
free parameters.
