  In this paper the general form of scattering amplitudes for massless
particles with equal spins s ($s s \to s s$) or unequal spins ($s_a s_b \to s_a
s_b$) are derived. The imposed conditions are that the amplitudes should have
the lowest possible dimension, have propagators of dimension $m^{-2}$, and obey
gauge invariance. It is shown that the number of momenta required for
amplitudes involving particles with s > 2 is higher than the number implied by
3-vertices for higher spin particles derived in the literature. Therefore, the
dimension of the coupling constants following from the latter 3-vertices has a
smaller power of an inverse mass than our results imply. Consequently, the
3-vertices in the literature cannot be the first interaction terms of a
gauge-invariant theory. When no spins s > 2 are present in the process the
known QCD, QED or (super) gravity amplitudes are obtained from the above
general amplitudes.
