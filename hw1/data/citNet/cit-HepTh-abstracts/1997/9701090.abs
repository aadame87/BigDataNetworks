Title: Restrictions on Magnetic Charge from Quantized Angular Momentum
Author: Douglas Singleton
Comments: 9 pages ReVTeX
\\
  Using the result that an electric charge - magnetic charge system carries an
internal field angular momentum of $e g / 4 \pi$ we arrive at two restrictions
on magnetic monopoles via the requirement of angular momentum quantization
and/or conservation. First we show that magnetic charge should scale in the
opposite way from electric charge. Second we show that free, unconfined
monopoles seem to be inconsistent when one considers a magnetic charge in the
vicinity of more than one electric charge.
