  The response of isodoublet fermions to classical backgrounds of essentially
2-dimensional boson fields in SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is investigated. In
particular, the spectral flow of Dirac eigenvalues is calculated for a
non-contractible sphere of configurations passing through the vacuum and the
Z-string (the embedded vortex solution). Also, a non-vanishing Berry phase is
established for adiabatic transport "around" the Z-string. These results imply
the existence of a new type of global (non-perturbative) gauge anomaly in SU(2)
Yang-Mills-Higgs quantum field theory with a single doublet of left-handed
fermions. Possible extensions to other chiral gauge field theories are also
discussed.
