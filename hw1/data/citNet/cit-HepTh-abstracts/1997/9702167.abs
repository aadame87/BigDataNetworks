Title: U Duality, Solvable Lie Algebras and Extremal Black-Holes
Author: Pietro Fr\'e
Notes: LaTeX, {article.sty} 37 pages, 3 figures. Talk given at the III National
  Meeting of the Italian Society for General Relativity (SIGRAV) on the
  occasion of Prof. Bruno Bertotti's 65th birthday. Rome September 1996

  In this lecture I review recent results on the use of Solvable Lie Algebras
as an efficient description of the scalar field sector of supergravities in
relation with their non perturbative structure encoded in the U-duality group.
I also review recent results on the construction of BPS saturated states as
solution of the first differential equations following from imposing
preservation of a fraction of the original supersymmetries. In particular I
discuss N=2 extremal black holes that are approximated by a Bertotti Robinson
metric near their horizon. The extension of this construction to maximally
extended supergravities in all dimensions from 4 to 11 is work in progress
where the use of the Solvable Lie algebra approach promises to be of decisive
usefulness.
