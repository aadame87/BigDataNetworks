  We determine the boundary state for both the NS-NS and R-R sectors of
superstring theory. We show how they are modified under a boost. The boosted
boundary state is then used for computing the interaction of two D-branes
moving with constant velocity reproducing with a completely different method a
recent calculation by Bachas.
