  Effective actions are derived for (2,0) and (2,1) superstrings by studying
the corresponding sigma-models. The geometry is a generalisation of Kahler
geometry involving torsion and the field equations imply that the curvature
with torsion is self-dual in four dimensions, or has SU(n,m) holonomy in other
dimensions. The Yang-Mills fields are self-dual in four dimensions and satisfy
a form of the Uhlenbeck-Yau equation in higher dimensions. In four dimensions
with Euclidean signature, there is a hyperkahler structure and the sigma-model
has (4,1) supersymmetry, while for signature (2,2) there is a hypersymplectic
structure consisting of a complex structure squaring to -1 and two real
structures squaring to 1. The theory is invariant under a twisted form of the
(4,1) superconformal algebra which includes an SL(2,R) Kac-Moody algebra
instead of an SU(2) Kac-Moody algebra. Kahler and related geometries are
generalised to ones involving real structures.
