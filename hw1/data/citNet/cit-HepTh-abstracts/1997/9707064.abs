  We discuss the possibility of generalizing some aspects of the C-theorem
within two different approaches, the conventional RG and the Wilson RG flows.
We show that the original Zamolodchikov's theorem is related to the existence
of the phase transitions in finite temperature QFT. We present some arguments
related to the holomorphic property of the low energy Wilson effective action.
