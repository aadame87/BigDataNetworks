  We consider a brane moving close to a large number of coincident branes. We
compare the calculation of the effective action using the gauge theory living
on the brane and the calculation using the supergravity approximation. We
discuss some general features about the correspondence between large N gauge
theories and black holes. Then we do a one loop calculation which applies for
extremal and near extremal black holes. We comment on the expected results for
higher loop calculations. We make some comments on the Matrix theory
interpretation of these results.
