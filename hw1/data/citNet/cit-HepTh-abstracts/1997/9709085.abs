Authors: Carlos M. Naon
Comments: 25 pages, latex, no figures. Talk delivered at Trends in Theoretical
  Physics - CERN - Santiago de Compostela - La Plata Meeting, La Plata,
  April-May 1997, to be published. Abstract modified
\\
  In this talk I describe a recently introduced field-theoretical approach that
can be used as an alternative framework to study one-dimensional systems of
highly correlated particles.
