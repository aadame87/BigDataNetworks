  We investigate the scattering of an electron by an infinitely thin and
infinitely long straight magnetic flux tube in the framework of QED. We discuss
the solutions of the Dirac and Maxwell fields in the related external pure AB
potential and evaluate matrix elements and differential probabilities for the
bremsstrahlung process. The dependence of the resulting cross section on the
energy, direction and polarization of the involved particles is analyzed. In
the low energy regime a surprising angular asymmetry is found which results
from the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with the magnetic field.
