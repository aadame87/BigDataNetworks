  Employing factorized versions of characters as products of quantum
dilogarithms corresponding to irreducible representations of the Virasoro
algebra, we obtain character formulae which admit an anyonic quasi-particle
interpretation in the context of minimal models in conformal field theories. We
propose anyonic thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, together with their
corresponding equation for the Virasoro central charge, on the base of an
analysis of the classical limit for the characters and the requirement that the
scattering matrices are asymptotically phaseless.
