  We study a model of free massless scalar fields on a two dimensional cylinder
with metric that admits a change of signature between Lorentzian and Euclidean
type (ET), across the two timelike hypersurfaces (with respect to Lorentzian
region). Considering a long strip-shaped region of the cylinder, denoted by an
angle \theta, as the signature changed region it is shown that the energy
spectrum depends on the angle \theta and in a sense differs from ordinary one
for low energies. Morever diffeomorphism algebra of corresponding infinite
conserved charges is different from '' Virasoro'' algebra and approaches to it
at higher energies. The central term is also modified but does not approach to
the ordinary one at higher energies.
