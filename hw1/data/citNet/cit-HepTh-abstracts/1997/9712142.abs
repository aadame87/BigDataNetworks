  Like the M-theory itself also the worldvolume theory of the M5-brane contains
brane excitations, which can be extracted from the supersymmetry algebra. Bound
states (intersecting branes) of the worldvolume can be translated into bound
states of {11-d} SUGRA. In this paper, we discuss the matrix description for
these bound states and their entropy (=degeneracy). In order to decouple the
worldvolume field theory from the bulk gravity we have especially to assume
that all charges are large, which gives a nice agreement with the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes.
