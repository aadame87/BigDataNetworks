Title: Bethe Ansatz in Quantum Mechanics. 2. Construction of Multi-Parameter
  Spectral Equations

\\
  In this paper we propose a simple method for building exactly solvable
multi-parameter spectral equations which in turn can be used for constructing
completely integrable and exactly solvable quantum systems. The method is based
on the use of a special functional relation which we call the scalar triangle
equation because of its similarity to the classical Yang-Baxter equation.
