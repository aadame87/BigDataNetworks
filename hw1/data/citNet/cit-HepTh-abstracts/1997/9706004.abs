Title: Quantum Brans-Dicke Gravity in Euclidean Path Integral Formulation

\\
  The conformal structure of Brans-Dicke gravity action is carefully studied.
It is discussed that Brans-Dicke gravity action has definitely no conformal
invariance. It is shown, however, that this lack of conformal invariance
enables us to demonstrate that Brans-Dicke theory appears to have a better
short-distance behavior than Einstein gravity as far as Euclidean path integral
formulation for quantum gravity is concerned.
