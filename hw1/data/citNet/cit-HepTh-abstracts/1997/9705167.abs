  Energy eigenstates for N=2 supersymmetric gauged quantum mechanics are found
for the gauges groups SU(n) and U(n). The analysis is aided by the existence of
an infinite number of conserved operators. The spectum is continuous.
Perturbative eigenstates for $N>2$ are also presented, a case which is relevant
for the conjectured description of M theory in the infinite momentum frame.
