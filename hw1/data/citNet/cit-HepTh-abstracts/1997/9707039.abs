  The spherically symmetric solution in classical SU(3) Yang - Mills theory is
found. It is supposed that such solution describes a classical quark. It is
regular in origin and hence the interaction between two quarks is small on the
small distance. The obtained solution has the singularity on infinity. It is
possible that is the reason why the free quark cannot exist. Evidently,
nonlocality of this object leads to the fact that in quantum chromodynamic the
difficulties arise connected with investigation of quarks interaction on large
distance.
