  The fivebrane of M theory is used in order to study the moduli space of vacua
of confining phase N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. The
supersymmetric vacua correspond to the condensation of massless monopoles and
confinement of photons. The monopole and meson vacuum expectation values are
computed using the fivebrane configuration. The comparison of the fivebrane
computation and the field theory analysis shows that at vacua with a
classically enhanced gauge group SU(r) the effective superpotential obtained by
the "integrating in" method is exact for r=2 but is not exact for r > 2. The
fivebrane configuration corresponding to N=1 gauge theories with
Landau-Ginzburg type superpotentials is studied. N=1 non-trivial fixed points
are analyzed using the brane geometry.
