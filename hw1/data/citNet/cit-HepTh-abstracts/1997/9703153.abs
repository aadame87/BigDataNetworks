  N flavor QED in two dimensions is reduced to a quantum mechanics problem with
N degrees of freedom for which the potential is determined by the ground state
of the problem itself. The chiral condensate is determined at all values of
temperature, fermion masses, and the $\theta$ parameter. In the single flavor
case, the anomalous mass (m) dependence of the chiral condensate at
$\theta=\pi$ at low temperature is found. The critical value is given by $m_c
\sim .437 e/\sqrt{\pi}$.
