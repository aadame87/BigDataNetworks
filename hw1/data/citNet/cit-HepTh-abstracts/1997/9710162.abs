  Using a regularization with the properties of dimensional regularization,
higher order local consistency conditions on one loop anomalies and divergent
counterterms are given. They are derived without any a priori assumption on the
form of the BRST cohomology and can be summarized by the statements that (i)
the antibracket involving the first order divergent counterterms, respectively
the first order anomaly, with any BRST cocycle is BRST exact, (ii) the first
order divergent counterterms can be completed into a local deformation of the
solution of the master equation and (iii) the first order anomaly can be
deformed into a local cocycle of the deformed solution.
