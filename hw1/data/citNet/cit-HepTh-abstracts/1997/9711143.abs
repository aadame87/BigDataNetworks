  The construction of four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories via the
fivebrane of M theory wrapped around a Riemann surface has been successfully
applied to the computation of holomorphic quantities of field theory. In this
paper we compute non-holomorphic quantities in the eleven dimensional
supergravity limit of M theory. While the Kahler potential on the Coulomb of
N=2 theories is correctly reproduced, higher derivative terms in the N=2
effective action differ from what is expected for the four dimensional gauge
theory. For the Kahler potential of N=1 theories at an abelian Coulomb phase,
the result again differs from what is expected for the four-dimensional gauge
theory. Using a gravitational back reaction method for the fivebrane we compute
the metric on the Higgs branch of N=2 gauge theories. Here we find an agreement
with the results expected for the gauge theories. A similar computation of the
metric on N=1 Higgs branches yields information on the complex structure
associated with the flavor rotation in one case and the classical metric in
another. We discuss what four-dimensional field theory quantities can be
computed via the fivebrane in the supergravity limit of M theory.
