  This paper presents a construction of isospectral problems on the torus. The
construction starts from an SU(n) version of the XYZ Gaudin model recently
studied by Kuroki and Takebe in the context of a twisted WZW model. In the
classical limit, the quantum Hamiltonians of the generalized Gaudin model turn
into classical Hamiltonians with a natural $r$-matrix structure. These
Hamiltonians are used to build a non-autonomous multi-time Hamiltonian system,
which is eventually shown to be an isomonodromic problem on the torus. This
isomonodromic problem can also be reproduced from an elliptic analogue of the
KZ equation for the twisted WZW model. Finally, a geometric interpretation of
this isomonodromic problem is discussed in the language of a moduli space of
meromorphic connections.
