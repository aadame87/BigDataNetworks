  We have constructed the N=1/2 supersymmetric general Abelian model with
asymmetric chiral couplings. This leads to a N=1/2 supersymmetrization of
the Schwinger model. We show that the supersymmetric general model is plagued
with problems of infrared divergence. Only the supersymmetric chiral Schwinger
model is free from such problems and is dynamically equivalent to the chiral
Schwinger model because of the peculiar structure of the N=1/2 multiplets.
