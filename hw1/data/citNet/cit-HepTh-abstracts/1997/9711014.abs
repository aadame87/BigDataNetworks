  In the absence of a complete M-theory, we gather certain quantum aspects of
this theory, namely, M-2 and M-5 brane duality and their tension quantization
rule $2\kappa^2 T_2 T_5 = 2 \pi n$, the M-2 brane tension quantization $T_2
=\bigg({(2\pi)^2/2\kappa^2 m}\bigg)^{1/3}$, supersymmetry, perturbative gauge
and gravitational anomaly cancellations, and the half-integral quantization of
[$G^W/2\pi$], and study the consistency among these quantum effects. We find:
(1) The complete determination of Ho\u{r}ava-Witten's
 $\eta = \lambda^6 /\kappa^4$ for M-theory on $R^{10} \times S^1/ Z_2$ requires
not only the cancellation of M-theory gauge anomaly but also that of the
gravitational anomaly, the quantization of M-2 brane tension, and the recently
recognized half-integral quantization of $[G^W / 2 \pi]$. (2) A well-defined
quantum M-theory necessarily requires the presence of both M-2 and M-5 branes
and allows only $n = 1$ and $m =1$ for the respectively quantized M-2 and M-5
brane tensions. Implications of the above along with other related issues are
discussed.
