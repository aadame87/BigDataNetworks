  Recent results of Trudinger on Isoperimetric Inequalities for non-convex
bodies are applied to the gravitational collapse of a lightlike shell of
matter to form a black hole. Using some integral identities for co-dimension
two surfaces in Minkowski spacetime, the area $A$ of the apparent horizon is
shown to be bounded above in terms of the mass $M$ by the $16 \pi G^2 M^2$,
which is consistent with the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis. The results hold
in four spacetime dimensions and above.
