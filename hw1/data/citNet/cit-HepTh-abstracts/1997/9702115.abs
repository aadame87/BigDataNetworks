  We review in detail the recently discovered phenomenon of partial spontaneous
breaking of supersymmetry in the case of a N=2 pure gauge U(1) theory, and
recall how the standard lore no-go theorem is evaded. We discuss the extension
of this mechanism to theories with charged matter, and surprisingly find that
the gauging forbids the existence of a magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term.
