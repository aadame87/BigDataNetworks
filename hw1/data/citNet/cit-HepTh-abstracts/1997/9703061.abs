Title: Further illustration of the use of the Frobenius-Schwinger-Dyson
  equations

  The Frobenius-Schwinger-Dyson equations are a rather high-brow abstract
nonsense type of equations describing n-point functions of arbitrarily high
composite insertions. It is not clear how to solve or even find approximate
solutions of these equations in general, but they are worth investigating
because (a certain preferred type of) renormalization of composite insertions
has been performed in advance: it just remains to find solutions given an
action and renormalization conditions. Earlier work in this field involved only
Gaussian actions or variable transformations thereof. In this work we
illustrate the use of Frobenius-Schwinger-Dyson at a less obviously trivial
level, that of the Thirring model.
