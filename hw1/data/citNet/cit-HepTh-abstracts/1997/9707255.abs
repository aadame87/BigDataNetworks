Title: Burgers turbulence with pressure
Author: S. Boldyrev
Comments: 4 pages, revtex
\\
  The randomly driven Burgers equation with pressure is considered as a 1D
model of strong turbulence of compressible fluid. It is shown that infinitely
small pressure provides a finite effect on the velocity and density statistics
and this case therefore is qualitatively different from turbulence without
pressure. We establish the corresponding operator product expansion and predict
the intermittent velocity- difference and mass-difference PDFs. We then apply
the developed methods to the statistics of a passive scalar advected by the
Burgers field.
