  Generalisations of the familiar Euler top equations in three dimensions are
proposed which admit a sufficiently large number of conservation laws to permit
integrability by quadratures. The usual top is a classical analogue of the Nahm
equations. One of the examples discussed here is a seven-dimensional Euler top,
which arises as a classical counterpart to the eight-dimensional self-dual
equations which are currently believed to play a role in new developments in
string theory.
