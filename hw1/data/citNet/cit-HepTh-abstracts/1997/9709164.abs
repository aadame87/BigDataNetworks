Title: Brackets in the jet-bundle approach to field theory
Author: Glenn Barnich
Comments: 15 pages AMS-latex file, talk given at the conference ``Secondary
  Calculus and Cohomological Physics, August 24--31, 1997, Moscow, Russia''
\\
  In the first part the sh Lie structure of brackets in field theory, described
in the jet bundle context along the lines suggested by Gel'fand, Dickey and
Dorfman, is analyzed. In the second part, we discuss how this description
allows us to find a natural relation between the Batalin-Vilkovisky antibracket
and the Poisson bracket.
