  We compute the BRST cohomology of the holomorphic part of the N=2 string at
arbitrary ghost and picture number. We confirm the expectation that the
relative cohomology at non-zero momentum consists of a single massless state in
each picture. The absolute cohomology is obtained by an independent method
based on homological algebra. For vanishing momentum, the relative and absolute
cohomologies both display a picture dependence -- a phenomenon discovered
recently also in the relative Ramond sector of N=1 strings by Berkovits and
Zwiebach.
