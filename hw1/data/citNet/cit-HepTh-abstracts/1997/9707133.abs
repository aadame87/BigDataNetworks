  There have been known "exact" beta functions for the gauge coupling in N=1
supersymmetric gauge theories, the so-called NSVZ beta functions. Shifman and
Vainshtein (SV) further related these beta functions to the exact 1-loop
running of the "Wilsonian" gauge coupling. All these results, however, remain
somewhat mysterious. We attempt to clarify these issues by presenting new
perspectives on the NSVZ beta function. Our interpretation of the results is
somewhat different than the one given by SV, having nothing to do with the
distinction between "Wilsonian" and "1PI" effective actions. Throughout we work
in the context of the Wilsonian Renormalization Group; namely, as the cutoff of
the theory is changed from M to M', we determine the appropriate changes in the
bare couplings needed to keep the low energy physics fixed. The entire analysis
is therefore free of infrared subtleties. When the bare Lagrangian given at the
cutoff is manifestly holomorphic in the gauge coupling, we show that the
required change in the holomorphic gauge coupling is exhausted at 1-loop to all
orders of perturbation theory, and even non-perturbatively in some cases. On
the other hand, when the bare Lagrangian has canonically normalized kinetic
terms, we find that the required change in the gauge coupling is given by the
NSVZ beta function. The higher order contributions in the NSVZ beta function
are due to anomalous Jacobians under the rescaling of the fields done in
passing from holomorphic to canonical normalization. We also give prescriptions
for regularizing certain N=1 theories with an ultraviolet cutoff M preserving
manifest holomorphy, starting from finite N=4 and N=2 theories. It is then in
principle possible to check the validity of the exact beta function by higher
order calculations in these theories.
