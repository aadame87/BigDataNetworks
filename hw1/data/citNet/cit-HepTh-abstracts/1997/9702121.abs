Title: The five exceptional simple Lie superalgebras of vector fields
Author: Irina Shchepochkina
Comments: LeTeX, 23 pages
\\
  The five simple exceptional complex Lie superalgbras of vector fields are
described. One of them is new; the other four are explicitely described for the
first time. All of the exceptional Lie superalgebras are obtained with the help
of the Cartan prolongation or a generalized prolongation.
  The description of several of the exceptional Lie superalgebras is associated
with the Lie superalgebra AS - the nontrivial central extension of the
supertraceless subalgebra SPE(4) of the periplectic Lie superalgebra PE(4) that
preserves the nondegenerate odd bilinear form on the (4|4)-dimensional
superspace. (A nontrivial central extension of SPE(n) only exists for n=4.)
