  The exact decay rate for emission of massless minimally coupled scalar fields
by a non-extremal black hole in 2+1 dimensions is obtained. At low energy, the
decay rate into scalars with zero angular momentum is correctly reproduced
within conformal field theory. The conformal field theory has both left- and
right-moving sectors and their contribution to the decay rate is associated
naturally with left and right temperatures of the black hole.
