  In the generalized Hamiltonian formalism by Dirac, the method of constructing
the generator of local-symmetry transformations for systems with first- and
second-class constraints (without restrictions on the algebra of constraints)
is obtained from the requirement for them to map the solutions of the
Hamiltonian equations of motion into the solutions of the same equations. It is
proved that second-class constraints do not contribute to the transformation
law of the local symmetry entirely stipulated by all the first-class
constraints (and only by them). A mechanism of occurrence of higher derivatives
of coordinates and group parameters in the symmetry transformation law in the
Noether second theorem is elucidated. It is shown that the obtained
transformations of symmetry are canonical in the extended (by Ostrogradsky)
phase space. An application of the method in theories with higher derivatives
is demonstrated with an example of the spinor Christ -- Lee model.
