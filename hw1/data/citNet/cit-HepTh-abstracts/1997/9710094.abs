  Within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory a general method is
presented which allows one to compute and classify the short distance (scaling)
limit of any algebra of local observables. The results can be used to determine
the particle and symmetry content of a theory at very small scales and thereby
give an intrinsic meaning to notions such as ``parton'' and ``confinement''.
The method has been tested in models. (Invited talk given at the International
Congress of Mathematical Physics, July 1997, Brisbane)
