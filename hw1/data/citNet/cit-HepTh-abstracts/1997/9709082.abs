  Using twistor methods we derive a generating function which leads to the
hyperk\" ahler metric on a deformation of the Atiyah-Hitchin monopole moduli
space. This deformation was first considered by Dancer through the quotient
construction and is related to a charge two monopole configuration in a
completely broken SU(3) gauge theory. The manifold and metric are the first
members of a family of hyperk\" ahler manifolds which are deformations of the
$D_k$ rational singularities of $C^2$.
