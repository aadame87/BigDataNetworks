  We develop an adequate description of non-topological solitons with a small
charge, for which the thin-wall approximation is not valid. There is no
classical lower limit on the charge of a stable Q-ball. We examine the
parameters of these small-charge solitons and discuss the limits of
applicability of the semiclassical approximation.
