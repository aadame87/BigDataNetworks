  We study exact renormalization group (RG) in O(4) gauged supergravity using
the effective average action formalism. The nonperturbative RG equations for
cosmological and newtonian coupling constants are found. It is shown the
existence of (nonstable) fixed point of these equations. The solution of RG
equation for newtonian coupling constant is qualitatively the same as in
Einstein gravity(i.e. it is growing at large distances).
