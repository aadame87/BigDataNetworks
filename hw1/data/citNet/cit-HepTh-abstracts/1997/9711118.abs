  In this contribution I summarize the achievements of separation of variables
in integrable quantum systems from the point of view of path integrals. This
includes the free motion on homogeneous spaces, and motion subject to a
potential force, and I would like to propose systematic investigations of
parametric coordinate systems on homogeneous spaces.
