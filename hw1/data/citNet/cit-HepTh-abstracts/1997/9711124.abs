  We study D-branes on three-dimensional orbifold backgrounds that admit
topologically distinct resolutions differing by flop transitions. We show that
these distinct phases are part of the vacuum moduli space of the super
Yang-Mills gauge theory describing the D-brane dynamics. In this way we
establish that D-branes --- like fundamental strings --- allow for physically
smooth topology changing transitions.
