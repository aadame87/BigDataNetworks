  The thermodynamics of a gas of strings and D-branes near the Hagedorn
transition is described by a coupled set of Boltzmann equations for weakly
interacting open and closed long strings. The resulting distributions are
dominated by the open string sector, indicating that D-branes grow to fill
space at high temperature.
