  It is known that the spin structure on a Riemannian manifold can be extended
to noncommutative geometry using the notion of a spectral triple. For finite
geometries, the corresponding finite spectral triples are completely described
in terms of matrices and classified using diagrams. When tensorized with the
ordinary space-time geometry, finite spectral triples give rise to Yang-Mills
theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, whose characteristic features are
given within the diagrammatic approach: vertices of the diagram correspond to
gauge multiplets of chiral fermions and links to Yukawa couplings.
