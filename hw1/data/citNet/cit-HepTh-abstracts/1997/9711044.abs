  We present some methods of determining explicit solutions for self-dual
supermembranes in 4+1 and 8+1 dimensions with spherical or toroidal topology.
For configurations of axial symmetry, the continuous SU(\infty) Toda equation
turns out to play a central role, and a specific method of determining all the
periodic solutions are suggested. A number of examples are studied in detail.
