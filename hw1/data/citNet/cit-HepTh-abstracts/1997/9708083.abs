  The finite N version of Matrix theory describes M-theory and superstrings in
so-called discretized light cone quantization (DLCQ). Its role has been
explained for M-theory in 11 dimensions and for type IIA theory. We show
novelties which arise by generalizing the ideas to heterotic strings. The
states which arise in O(N) theories with odd N we interpret as fields which are
antiperiodic in the longitudinal direction. Consistency of these ideas provides
a new evidence for the conjecture that finite N models describe sectors with a
given longitudinal momentum.
