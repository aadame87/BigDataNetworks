  A model of a relativistic particle moving in the Liouville field is
investigated. Symmetry group of the system is $SL(2,R)/Z_2$. The corresponding
dynamical integrals describe full set of classical trajectories. Dynamical
integrals are used for the gauge-invariant Hamiltonian reduction. The new
scheme is proposed for quantization of the reduced system. Obtained quantum
system reproduces classical symmetry. Physical aspects of the model are
discussed.
