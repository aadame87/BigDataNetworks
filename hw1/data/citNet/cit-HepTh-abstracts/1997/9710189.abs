  In this report we obtain explicit string-like solutions of equations of
motion of massive heterotic supergravity recently obtained by Bergshoeff, Roo
and Eyras. We also find consistent string source which can be embedded in these
backgrounds when space-time dimension is greater than or equal to six.
