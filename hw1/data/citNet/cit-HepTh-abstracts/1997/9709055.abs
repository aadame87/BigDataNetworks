  We derive a two-dimensional effective dilaton - gravity - matter action that
describes the dynamics of an uncharged black p-brane in N dimensions. We show
that this effective theory is completely integrable in the static sector and
establish its general static solution. The solution includes, as a particular
case, the boost symmetric p-brane solution investigated in hep-th/9510202 .
