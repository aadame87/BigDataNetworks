  We use dimensional reduction techniques to relate real time finite T
correlation functions in (2+1) dimensional QCD to bound state parameters in a
generalized 't Hooft model with an infinite number of heavy quark and adjoint
scalar fields. While static susceptibilities and correlation functions of the
DeTar type can be calculated using only the light (static) gluonic modes, the
dynamical correlators require the inclusion of the heavy modes. In particular
we demonstrate that the leading T perturbative result can be understood in
terms of the bound states of the 2d model and that consistency requires bound
state trajectories composed of both quarks and adjoint scalars. We also propose
a non-perturbative expression for the dynamical DeTar correlators at small
spatial momenta.
