  Extending recent N=1 and N=2 results, we propose an explicit formula for the
integration measure on the moduli space of charge-n ADHM multi-instantons in
N=4 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory. As a consistency check, we derive a
renormalization group relation between the N=4, N=2, and N=1 measures. We then
use this relation to construct the purely bosonic (``N=0'') measure as well, in
the classical approximation in which the one-loop small-fluctuations
determinants is not included.
