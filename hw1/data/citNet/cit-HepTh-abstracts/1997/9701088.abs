  We review the properties of classical p-brane solutions to supergravity
theories, i.e. solutions that may be interpreted as Poincare-invariant
hyperplanes in spacetime. Topics covered include the distinction between
elementary/electric and solitonic/magnetic solutions, examples of singularity
and global structure, relations between mass densities, charge densities and
the preservation of unbroken supersymmetry, diagonal and vertical Kaluza-Klein
reduction families, Scherk-Schwarz reduction and domain walls, and the
classification of multiplicities using duality symmetries.
