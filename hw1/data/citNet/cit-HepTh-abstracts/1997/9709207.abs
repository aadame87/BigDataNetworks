  We investigate the classical limit of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard
equations, considered as a system of non-stationar Schr\"{o}odinger equations
on singular curves, where times are the moduli of curves. It has a form of
reduced non-autonomous hamiltonian systems which include as particular examples
the Schlesinger equations, Painlev\'{e} VI equation and their generalizations.
In general case, they are defined as hierarchies of isomonodromic deformations
(HID) with respect to changing the moduli of underling curves. HID are
accompanying with the Whitham hierarchies. The phase space of HID is the space
of flat connections of $G$ bundles with some additional data in the marked
points. HID can be derived from some free field theory by the hamiltonian
reduction under the action of the gauge symmetries and subsequent factorization
with respect to diffeomorphisms of curve. This approach allows to define the
Lax equations associated with HID and the linear system whose isomonodromic
deformations are provided by HID. In addition, it leads to description of
solutions of HID by the projection method.
  In some special limit HID convert into the Hitchin systems. In particular,
for $\SL$ bundles over elliptic curves with a marked point we obtain in this
limit the elliptic Calogero $N$-body system
