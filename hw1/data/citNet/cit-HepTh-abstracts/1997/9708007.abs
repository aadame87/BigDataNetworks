  A global supersymmetry (SUSY) in supersymmetric gauge theory is generally
broken by gauge fixing. A prescription to extract physical information from
such SUSY algebra broken by gauge fixing is analyzed in path integral
framework. If $\delta_{SUSY}\delta_{BRST}\Psi = \delta_{BRST}\delta_{SUSY}\Psi$
for a gauge fixing ``fermion'' $\Psi$, the SUSY charge density is written as a
sum of the piece which is naively expected without gauge fixing and a BRST
exact piece. If $\delta_{SUSY}\delta_{SUSY}\delta_{BRST}\Psi =
\delta_{BRST}\delta_{SUSY}\delta_{SUSY}\Psi$, the equal-time anti-commutator of
SUSY charge is written as a sum of a physical piece and a BRST exact piece. We
illustrate these properties for N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories
and for a D=10 massive superparticle (or ``D-particle'') where the
$\kappa$-symmetry provides extra complications.
