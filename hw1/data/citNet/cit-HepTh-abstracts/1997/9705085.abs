  We subject the methodology used to derive the effective dynamics of
topological defects to a critical reappraisal, using the two-dimensional kink
as an illustrative example. Special care is taken on how the zero modes should
be handled in order to avoid overcounting of degrees of freedom. This is an
issue that has been overlooked in many recent contributions on the derivation
of domain wall effective actions. We show that, unless such redundancy is
completely removed by means of a sort of gauge-fixing, the expression obtained
for the effective action will not be consistent. We readdress some earlier
calculations over the existence of curvature corrections in the light of the
previous discussion and briefly comment on the application of this method to
higher dimensional topological defects.
