Title: Black Hole Thermodynamics in Semi-Classical and Superstring Theory
Authors: Sascha Vongehr
Comments: 65 pages, Latex
\\
  This is a revised and shortened version of a MSc thesis submitted to the
University of Sussex, UK. An introduction into the pre-string physics of black
holes and related thermodynamics is given. Then, starting with an introduction
of how superstring theory is approaching the problem of black hole entropy,
work on that and closely related topics like Hawking radiation and the
information paradox is reviewed.
