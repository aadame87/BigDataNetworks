  We give the general solution for the elementary and solitonic D-brane
configurations as a result of a reinterpretation of the already known p-branes.
These solutions are found by means of a relevant conformal transformation on
the string inspired action and its dual form. From this point of view, the
nature of the electric and magnetic charge is clearer and the elementary and
solitonic behaviour dependence on the initial lagrangian set. We give a
complete characterisation of the spacetime defined by these solutions. The dual
pair of instanton and 7-brane solution is presented as an example.
