  We study the T^5/Z_2 orbifold compactification of the M-theory matrix model.
This model was originally studied by Dasgupta, Mukhi, and Witten. It was found
that one had to add 16 5-branes to the system to make the compactification
consistent. We demonstrate how this is mimicked in the matrix model.
