  We explain the observation by Candelas and Font that the Dynkin diagrams of
nonabelian gauge groups occurring in type IIA and F-theory can be read off from
the polyhedron $\Delta^*$ that provides the toric description of the
Calabi-Yau manifold used for compacification. We show how the intersection
pattern of toric divisors corresponding to the degeneration of elliptic fibers
follows the ADE classification of singularities and the Kodaira classification
of degenerations. We treat in detail the cases of elliptic K3 surfaces and K3
fibered threefolds where the fiber is again elliptic. We also explain how even
the occurrence of monodromy and non-simply laced groups in the latter case is
visible in the toric picture. These methods also work in the fourfold case.
