  Barton Zwiebach constructed the `string products' on the Hilbert space of
combined conformal field theory of matter and ghosts. It is well-known that the
`tree level' specialization of these products forms a strongly homotopy Lie
algebra. A strongly homotopy Lie algebra is given by a square zero coderivation
on the cofree cocommutative connected coalgebra, on the other hand, strongly
homotopy Lie algebras are algebras over the cobar construction on the
commutative algebras operad. The aim of our paper is to give two similar
characterizations of the structure formed by the `string products' of arbitrary
genera. Our first characterization will be based on the notion of a higher
order coderivation, the second characterization will be based on the machinery
of modular operads. We will also discuss possible generalizations to open
string field theory.
