  Dualities between certain supersymmetric gauge field theories in three and
four dimensions have been studied in considerable detail recently, by realizing
them as geometric manipulations of configurations of extended objects in type
II string theory. These extended objects include `D-branes' and
`NS-(five)branes'. In constructing the brane configurations which realize
dualities for orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups, an `orientifold' was
introduced, which results in non-orientable string sectors. Certain features of
orientifolded NS-branes -such as their existence- were assumed in the original
construction, which have not been verified directly. However, those features
fit very well together with the properties of the relevant field theories, and
subsequently yielded the known dualities. This letter describes how
orientifolded NS-branes can exist in type II string theory by displaying
explicitly that the assumed combinations of world-sheet and space-time
symmetries do indeed leave the NS-brane invariant and therefore can be gauged.
The resulting orientifolded NS-brane can be described in terms of background
fields, and furthermore as an exact conformal field theory, to exactly the same
extent as the standard NS-brane.
