  The long-range fields associated with non-abelian vortices generally obstruct
full realization, in the spectrum, of the symmetry of the ground state. In the
context of 2+1 dimensional field theories, we show how this effect manifests
itself concretely in altered conditions for the angular momentum and in the
energy spectrum. A particularly interesting case is supersymmetry, which is
obstructed by the gravitational effect of any mass.
