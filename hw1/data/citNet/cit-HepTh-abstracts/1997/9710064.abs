  In this work we study the recently introduced octonionic duality for
membranes. Restricting the self - duality equations to seven space dimensions,
we provide various forms for them which exhibit the symmetries of the
octonionic and quaternionic structure. These forms may turn to be useful for
the question of the integrability of this system. Introducing a consistent
quadratic Poisson algebra of functions on the membrane we are able to factorize
the time dependence of the self - duality equations. We further give the
general linear embeddings of the three dimensional system into the seven
dimensional one using the invariance of the self-duality equations under the
exceptional group G_2.
