  We studied the lowest order quantum corrections to the macroscopic wave
functions $\Gamma (A,\ell)$ of non-critical string theory using the
semi-classical expansion of Liouville theory. By carefully taking the perimeter
constraint into account we obtained a new type of boundary condition for the
Liouville field which is compatible with the reparametrization invariance of
the boundary and which is not only a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann types but
also involves an integral of an exponential of the Liouville field along the
boundary. This condition contains an unknown function of $A/\ell^2$. We
determined this function by computing part of the one-loop corrections to
$\Gamma (A,\ell)$.
