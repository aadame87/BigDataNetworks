  We construct a Chern-Simons action for q-deformed gauge theory which is a
simple and straightforward generalization of the usual one. Space-time
continues to be an ordinary (commuting) manifold, while the gauge potentials
and the field strengths become q-commuting fields. Our approach, which is
explicitly carried out for the case of `minimal' deformations, has the
advantage of leading naturally to a consistent Hamiltonian structure that has
essentially all of the features of the undeformed case. For example, using the
new Poisson brackets, the constraints form a closed algebra and generate
q-deformed gauge transformations.
