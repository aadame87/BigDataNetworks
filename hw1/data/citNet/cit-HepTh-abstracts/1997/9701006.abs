  Gluodynamics in 3D spacetime with one spatial direction compactified into a
circle of length $L$ is studied. The confinement order parameters, such as
the Polyakov loops, are analyzed in both the limits $L \to 0$ and $L \to
\infty$. In the latter limit the behavior of the confinement order parameters
is shown to be described by a 2D non-linear sigma-model on the compact coset
space $G/ad G$, where $G$ is the gauge group and $ad G$ its adjoint action on
$G$. Topological vortex-like excitations of the compact field variable cause
a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition which is argued to be associated with
the confinement phase transition in the 3D gluodynamics.
