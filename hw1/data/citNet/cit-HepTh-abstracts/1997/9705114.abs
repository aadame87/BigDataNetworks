  A supereigenvalue model with purely positive bosonic eigenvalues is presented
and solved by considering its superloop equations. This model represents the
supersymmetric generalization of the complex one matrix model, in analogy to
the relation between the supereigenvalue and the hermitian one matrix model.
Closed expressions for all planar multi-superloop correlation functions are
found. Moreover an iterative scheme allows the calculation of higher genus
contributions to the free energy and to the correlators. Explicit results for
genus one are given.
