Title: A Comment on a Fivebrane Term in Superalgebra
Author: Dimitri Polyakov
Comments: 5 pages, TeX
Report-no: IHES/97/P/xx
\\
  We review our recent discussion of fivebrane central terms that appear in the
space-time superalgebra in D=10 provided that the space-time supercharges
are taken in non-canonical pictures. We correct the mistake contained in the
original version of the earlier paper hep-th/9703008 which suggested that the
naive picture-changing of the superalgebra could give rise to the
non-perturbative five-form term. The relation between picture-changing and
p-brane central terms appears to be much more subtle, as is pointed out in the
revised version of the mentioned paper.
