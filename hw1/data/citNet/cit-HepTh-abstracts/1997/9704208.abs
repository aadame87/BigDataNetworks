  We present a numerical simulation of the scattering of a topological soliton
off finite size attractive impurities, repulsive impurities and a combination
of both. The attractive and attractive-repulsive cases show similar features to
those found for $\delta$ function type of impurities. For the repulsive case,
corresponding to a finite width barrier, the soliton behaves completely
classically. No tunneling occurs for sub-barrier kinetic energies despite the
extended nature of the soliton.
