  The occupied and unoccupied fermionic BPS quantum states of a type-IIA string
stretched between a D6-brane and an orthogonal D2-brane are described in
M-theory by two particular holomorphic curves embedded in a Kaluza-Klein
monopole. The absence of multiply-occupied fermionic states --- the Pauli
exclusion principle --- is manifested in M-theory by the absence of any other
holomorphic curves satisfying the necessary boundary conditions. Stable,
non-BPS states with multiple strings joining the D6-brane and D2-brane are
described M-theoretically by non-holomorphic curves.
