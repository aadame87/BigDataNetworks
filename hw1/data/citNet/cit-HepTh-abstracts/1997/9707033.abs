  We develop a new approach for bosonization based on the direct comparison of
current correlation functions and apply it to the case of the Massive Thirring
Model in three dimensions in the weak coupling regime, but with an arbitrary
mass. Explicit bosonized forms for the lagrangian and the current are obtained
in terms of a vector gauge field. Exact results for the corresponding
expressions are also obtained in the case of a free massive fermion. Finally, a
comment on the derivation of the current algebra directly from the bosonized
expressions is included.
