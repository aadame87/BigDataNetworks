  We review mechanisms of dynamical supersymmetry breaking. Several
observations that narrow the search for possible models of dynamical
supersymmetry breaking are summarized. These observations include the necessary
and sufficient conditions for supersymmetry breaking. The two conditions are
based on non-rigorous arguments, and we show examples where they are too
restrictive. Dynamical effects present in models with product gauge groups are
given special attention.
