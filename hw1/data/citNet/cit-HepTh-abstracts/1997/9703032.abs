Title: Single particles and composite systems in a mathematically rigorous
  formulation of relativistic quantum field theory
Author: Michael Danos
Comments: 24 pages, latex

  We define quantum field theory by taking the Lagrangian action to be given as
a sequence of mathematically well-defined functionals written in terms of
operator fields fulfilling given \hbox{local} commutation relations. The
renormalized solution fields have a fully defined Fock space expansion and are
\hbox{multi-local}; thus Haag's theorem does not apply, i.e., the interaction
picture exists. Also, the formalism allows immediately the definition of a wave
function and the description of many-body bound-state systems.
