  Anomalous contributions to the Jacobi identity of chromo-electric fields and
non-Abelian vector currents are calculated using a non-perturbative approach
that combines operator product expansion and a generalization of
Bjorken-Johnson-Low limit. The failure of the Jacobi identity and the
associated 3-cocycles are discussed.
