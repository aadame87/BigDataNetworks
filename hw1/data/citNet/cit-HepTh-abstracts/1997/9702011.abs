  We consider theories with a spontaneously broken gauged R-symmetry, which can
only occur in supergravity models. These give rise to cosmic R-strings upon
which gravitino zero modes can exist. We construct solutions to the
Rarita-Schwinger spin-3/2 equation describing the gravitino in the field of
these cosmic strings and show that under some conditions these solutions may
give rise to gravitino currents on the string. We discuss further mathematical
and physical questions associated with these solutions.
