  In this paper we formulate a general method for building completely
integrable quantum systems. The method is based on the use of the so-called
multi-parameter spectral equations, i.e. equations with several spectral
parameters. We show that any such equation, after eliminating some spectral
parameters by means of the so-called inverse procedure of separation of
variables can be reduced to a certain completely integrable model. Starting
with exactly or quasi-exactly solvable multi-parameter spectral equations we,
respectively, obtain exactly or quasi-exactly solvable integrable models.
