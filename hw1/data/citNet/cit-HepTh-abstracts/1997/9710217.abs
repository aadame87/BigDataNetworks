  The recent suggestion that the entropy of Schwarzschild black holes can be
computed in matrix theory using near-extremal D-brane thermodynamics is
examined. It is found that the regime in which this approach is valid actually
describes black strings stretched across the longitudinal direction, near the
transition where black strings become unstable to the formation of black holes.
It is argued that the appropriate dynamics on the other (black hole) side of
the transition is that of the zero modes of the corresponding super Yang-Mills
theory. A suggestive mean field theory argument is given for the entropy of
black holes in all dimensions. Consequences of the analysis for matrix theory
and the holographic principle are discussed.
