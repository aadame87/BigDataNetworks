  A many variable $q$-calculus is introduced using the formalism of braided
covector algebras. Its properties when certain of its deformation parameters
are roots of unity are discussed in detail, and related to fractional
supersymmetry. The special cases of two dimensional supersymmetry and
fractional supersymmetry are developed in detail.
