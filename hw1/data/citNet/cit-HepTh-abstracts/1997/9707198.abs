  The moduli spaces of two (0,2) compactifications of the heterotic string can
share the same Landau-Ginzburg model even though at large radius they look
completely different. It was argued that such a pair of (0,2) models might be
connected via a perturbative transition at the Landau-Ginzburg point.
Situations of this kind are studied for some explicit models. By calculating
the exact dimensions of the generic moduli spaces at large radius, strong
indications are found in favor of a different scenario. The two moduli spaces
are isomorphic and complex, K\"ahler and bundle moduli get exchanged.
