  The normal mode spectrum of the deuteron in the Skyrme model is computed. We
find a bound doublet mode below the pion mass, which can be related to the
well-known $90^{\circ}$ scattering of two skyrmions. We also find a singlet
`breather' mode and another doublet above the pion mass. The qualitative
pattern of the spectrum is similar to that recently found for the B=4
multiskyrmion. The symmetries of all the vibrational modes are presented.
