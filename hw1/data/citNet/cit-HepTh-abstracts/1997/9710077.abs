Title: Solution of a Relativistic Three-Body Problem
Author: H. Pierre Noyes and E. D. Jones
Comments: The second revision of this paper is minor, pointing out that the
  theory presented here is not Hamiltonian quantum mechanics but has instead
  the dispersion-theoretic foundation discussed extensively in HPN, Phys. Rev.
  C26, 1858-1877 (1982)

\\
  Starting from a relativistic s-wave scattering length model for the two
particle input we construct an unambiguous, unitary solution of the
relativistic three body problem given only the masses $m_a,m_b,m_c$ and the
masses of the two body bound states $\mu_{bc},\mu_{ca},\mu_{ab}$.
