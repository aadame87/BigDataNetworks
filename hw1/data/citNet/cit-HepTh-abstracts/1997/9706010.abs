  Superradiant scattering, which can be thought of as the wave analogue of the
Penrose process is revisited. As is well-known, boson fields display
superradiance provided they have frequency in a certain range whereas fermion
fields do not. A succinct superradiance-checking algorithm employing particle
number or energy current is formally reviewed and then applied to the case of
fermion field. The demonstrations of the absence of fermionic superradiance in
terms of the particle number current exist in the literature but they are in
the context of two-component SL(2,C) spinor formalism for massive spinor and
SO(3,1) Dirac spinor formalism for massless spinor. Here we present an
alternative demonstration in terms of both particle number and energy current
but in a different context of local SO(3,1) Dirac spinor formalism for both
massless and massive spinors. It appears that our presentation confirms the
absence of fermionic superradiance in a more simple and systematic manner.
