  We show that the abelian topological mass mechanism in four dimensions,
described by the Cremmer-Sherk action, can be obtained from dimensional
reduction in five dimensions. Starting from a gauge invariant action in five
dimensions, where the dual equivalence between a massless vector field and a
massless second-rank antisymmetric field in five dimensions is established, the
dimensional reduction is performed keeping only one massive mode. Furthermore,
the Kalb-Ramond action and the Stuckelberger formulation for massive spin-1 are
recovered.
