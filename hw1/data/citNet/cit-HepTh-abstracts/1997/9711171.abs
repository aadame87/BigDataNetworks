  The formulation of the local BRST cohomology on infinite jet bundles and its
relation and reduction to gauge covariant algebras are reviewed. As an
illustration, we compute the local BRST cohomology for geodesic motion in
(pseudo-) Riemannian manifolds and discuss briefly the result (symmetries,
constants of the motion, consistent deformations).
