  We discuss the principles to be used in the construction of discrete time
classical and quantum mechanics as applied to point particle systems. In the
classical theory this includes the concept of virtual path and the construction
of system functions from classical Lagrangians, Cadzow's variational principle
applied to the action sum, Maeda-Noether and Logan invariants of the motion,
elliptic and hyperbolic harmonic oscillator behaviour, gauge invariant
electrodynamics and charge conservation, and the Grassmannian oscillator. First
quantised discrete time mechanics is discussed via the concept of system
amplitude, which permits the construction of all quantities of interest such as
commutators and scattering amplitudes. We discuss stroboscopic quantum
mechanics, or the construction of discrete time quantum theory from continuous
time quantum theory and show how this works in detail for the free Newtonian
particle. We conclude with an application of the Schwinger action principle to
the important case of the quantised discrete time inhomogeneous oscillator.
