Title: String duality, automorphic forms, and generalized Kac-Moody algebras
Authors: Gregory Moore
Comments: 12 pages, latex. Talk at the Trieste conference on Duality
  Symmetries. Replaced version has a confusing misprint in equation 22 fixed

  This is a summary of a review talk at the Trieste conference on duality
symmetries in string theory, April 1997. We review some work that has been done
on the relation of BPS states, automorphic forms and the geometry of the
quantum ground states of string compactifications with extended supersymmetry,
emphasizing the (hypothetically) central role of BPS algebras.
