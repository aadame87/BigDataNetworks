Title: Excited-state energies and supersymmetric indices
Authors: Paul Fendley
Comments: 20 pages, 6 figures, amslatex. Revision adds appendix describing
  analogous calculation for a free Dirac fermion. To appear in Advances in
  Theoretical and Mathematical Physics

  We study multi-soliton states in two-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric theories.
We calculate their energy exactly as a function of mass and volume in the
simplest integrable N=2 theory, the sine-Gordon model at a particular coupling.
These energies are related to the expectation value $I= tr [\exp(in\pi F)
\exp(-H/T)]$, where F is the fermion number. For n=1, this is Witten's index;
for n an odd integer, we argue that $I$ is an index in the sense that it is
independent of all D-term variations.
