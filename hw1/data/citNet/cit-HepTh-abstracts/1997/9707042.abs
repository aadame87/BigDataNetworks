  We analyse the world-volume theory of multiple Kaluza-Klein monopoles in
string and M-theory by identifying the appropriate zero modes of various
fields. The results are consistent with supersymmetry, and all conjectured
duality symmetries. In particular for M-theory and type IIA string theory, the
low energy dynamics of N Kaluza-Klein monopoles is described by supersymmetric
U(N) gauge theory, and for type IIB string theory, the low energy dynamics is
described by a (2,0) supersymmetric field theory in (5+1) dimensions with N
tensor multiplets and tensionless self-dual strings. It is also argued that for
the Kaluza-Klein monopoles in heterotic string theory, the apparently flat
moduli space gets converted to the moduli space of BPS monopoles in SU(2) gauge
theory when higher derivative corrections to the supergravity equations of
motion are taken into account.
