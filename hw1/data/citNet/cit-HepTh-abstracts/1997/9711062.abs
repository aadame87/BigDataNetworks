\\
  It is shown that canonical quantization of the $4d$ Siegel superparticle
yields massless Wess-Zumino model as an effective field theory. Quantum states
of the superparticle are realized in terms of the real scalar superfields which
prove to be decomposed into the sum of on-shell chiral and antichiral
superfields.
