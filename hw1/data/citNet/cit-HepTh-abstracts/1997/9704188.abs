  We study the small oscillations regime (RPA approximation) of the
time-dependent mean-field equations, obtained in a previous work, which
describe the time evolution of one-body dynamical variables of a uniform
Chiral Gross-Neveu system. In this approximation we obtain an analytical
solution for the time evolution of the one-body dynamical variables. The
two-fermion physics can be explored through this solution. The condition for
the existence of bound states is examined.
