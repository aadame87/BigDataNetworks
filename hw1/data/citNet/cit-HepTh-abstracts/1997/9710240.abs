  We study the spectrum of 1+1 dimensional large $N$ QCD coupled to an adjoint
Majorana fermion of mass $m$. As $m\to 0$ this model makes a transition from
confinement to screening. We argue that in this limit the spectrum becomes
continuous for mass greater than twice the mass of the lightest bound state.
This critical mass is nothing but the threshold for a decay into two lightest
states. We present numerical results based on DLCQ that appear to support our
claim.
