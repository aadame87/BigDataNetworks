  We find exactly solvable dilaton gravity theories containing a U(1) gauge
field in two dimensional space-time. The classical general solutions for the
gravity sector (the metric plus the dilaton field) of the theories coupled to a
massless complex scalar field are obtained in terms of the stress-energy tensor
and the U(1) current of the scalar field. We discuss issues that arise when we
attempt to use these models for the study of the gravitational back-reaction.
