  We present a lagrangian formulation for recently-proposed supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory in twelve dimensions. The field content of our multiplet has
an additional auxiliary vector field in the adjoint representation. The usual
Yang-Mills field strength is modified by a Chern-Simons form containing this
auxiliary vector field. This formulation needs no constraint imposed on the
component field from outside, and a constraint on the Yang-Mills field is
generated as the field equation of the auxiliary vector field. The invariance
check of the action is also performed without any reference to constraints by
hand. Even though the total lagrangian takes a simple form, it has several
highly non-trivial extra symmetries. We couple this twelve-dimensional
supersymmetric Yang-Mills background to Green-Schwarz superstring, and confirm
fermionic kappa-invariance. As another improvement of this theory, we present a
set of fully Lorentz-covariant and supercovariant field equations with no use
of null-vectors. This system has an additional scalar field, whose gradient
plays a role of the null-vector. This system exhibits spontaneous breaking of
the original Lorentz symmetry SO(10,2) for twelve-dimensions down to SO(9,1)
for ten-dimensions.
