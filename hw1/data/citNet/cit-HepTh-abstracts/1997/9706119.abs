  We give the complete list of all first-order consistent interaction vertices
for a set of exterior form gauge fields of form degree >1, described in the
free limit by the standard Maxwell-like action. A special attention is paid to
the interactions that deform the gauge transformations. These are shown to be
necessarily of the Noether form "conserved antisymmetric tensor" times "p-form
potential" and exist only in particular spacetime dimensions. Conditions for
consistency to all orders in the coupling constant are given. For illustrative
purposes, the analysis is carried out explicitly for a system of forms with two
different degrees p and q (1<p<q<n).
