  We study the embedding of Kac-Moody algebras into Borcherds (or generalized
Kac-Moody) algebras which can be explicitly realized as Lie algebras of
physical states of some completely compactified bosonic string. The extra
``missing states'' can be decomposed into irreducible highest or lowest weight
``missing modules'' w.r.t. the relevant Kac-Moody subalgebra; the
corresponding lowest weights are associated with imaginary simple roots whose
multiplicities can be simply understood in terms of certain polarization states
of the associated string. We analyse in detail two examples where the momentum
lattice of the string is given by the unique even unimodular Lorentzian lattice
$II_{1,1}$ or $II_{9,1}$, respectively. The former leads to the Borcherds
algebra $g_{1,1}$, which we call ``gnome Lie algebra", with maximal Kac-Moody
subalgebra $A_1$. By the use of the denominator formula a complete set of
imaginary simple roots can be exhibited, whereas the DDF construction provides
an explicit Lie algebra basis in terms of purely longitudinal states of the
compactified string in two dimensions. The second example is the Borcherds
algebra $g_{9,1}$, whose maximal Kac-Moody subalgebra is the hyperbolic
algebra $E_{10}$. The imaginary simple roots at level 1, which give rise to
irreducible lowest weight modules for $E_{10}$, can be completely
characterized; furthermore, our explicit analysis of two non-trivial level-2
root spaces leads us to conjecture that these are in fact the only imaginary
simple roots for $g_{9,1}$.
