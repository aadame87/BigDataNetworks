  Type IIB string theory admits a BPS configuration in which three strings (of
different type) meet at a point. Using this three string configuration we
construct a string network and study its properties. In particular we prove
supersymmetry of this configuration. We also consider string lattices, which
can be used to construct BPS states in toroidally compactified string theory.
