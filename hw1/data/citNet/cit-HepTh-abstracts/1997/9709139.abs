  We study consistency conditions on a M(atrix)-model which would describe
M-theory on $T^6$. We argue that there is a limit in moduli space for which it
becomes a 6+1D theory and study the low-energy description of extended objects
in the decompactified limit. We discuss the requirements from a M(atrix)-model
which would describe such an $E_{6(6)}$ theory. We suggest that it could be a
5+1D theory and that a 1+1D theory with $(0,4)$ supersymmetry might be the
M(atrix)-model for the M(atrix)-model of the $E_{6(6)}$ theory.
