  Following recent proposal of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde, we show that
the M(atrix) theory compactified on $S_1/Z_2$ provides with a
non-perturbative description of second-quantized light-cone heterotic string.
This so-called heterotic M(atrix) string theory is defined by two-dimensional
(8,0) supersymmetric chiral gauge theory with gauge group SO(2N) in the large N
limit. We argue that at strong coupling fixed point the chiral gauge theory
flows to a (8,0) superconformal field theory defined via $S_N$ symmetric
product space orbifold. We show that the leading order correction to the strong
coupling expansion corresponds to a unique irrelevant operator of scaling
dimension three and describes joining and splitting cubic interactions of
light-cone heterotic string. We also speculate on M(atrix) description of
bosonic strings via dimensional reduction of d=26 Yang-Mills theory.
