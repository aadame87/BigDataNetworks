  Higher order coefficients of the inverse mass expansion of one-loop effective
actions are obtained from a one-dimensional path integral representation. For
the case of a massive scalar loop in the background of both a scalar potential
and a (non Abelian) gauge field explicit results to $O(T^5)$ in the proper time
parameter are presented.
