  We discuss topological theories, arising from the general $\CN=2$ twisted
gauge theories. We initiate a program of their study in the Gromov-Witten
paradigm. We re-examine the low-energy effective abelian theory in the presence
of sources and study the mixing between the various $p$-observables. We present
the twisted superfield formalism which makes duality transformations
transparent. We propose a scheme which uniquely fixes all the contact terms. We
derive a formula for the correlation functions of $p$-observables on the
manifolds of generalized simple type for $0 \leq p \leq 4$ and on some
manifolds with $b_{2}^{+} =1$. We study the theories with matter and explore
the properties of universal instanton. We also discuss the compactifications of
higher dimensional theories. Some relations to sigma models of type $A$ and $B$
are pointed out and exploited.
