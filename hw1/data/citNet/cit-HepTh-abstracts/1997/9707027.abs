  We study N=1 dualities in four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories as
the worldvolume theory of D4 branes with one compact direction in type IIA
string theory. We generalize the previous work for SO(N_{c1}) x Sp(N_{c2}) with
the superpotential W=Tr X^4 to the case of W= Tr X^4(k+1) in terms of brane
configuration. We conjecture that the new dualities for the product gauge
groups of SO(N_{c1}) x Sp(N_{c2}) x SO(N_{c3}), SO(N_{c1}) x Sp(N_{c2}) x
SO(N_{c3}) x Sp(N_{c4}) and higher multiple product gauge groups can be
obtained by reversing the ordering of NS5 branes and D6 branes while preserving
the linking numbers. We also describe the above dualities in terms of wrapping
D6 branes around 3 cycles of Calabi-Yau threefolds in type IIA string theory.
The theory with adjoint matter can be regarded as taking multiple copies of NS5
brane in the configuration of brane or geometric approaches.
