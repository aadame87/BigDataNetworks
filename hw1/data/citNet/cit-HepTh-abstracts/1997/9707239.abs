  We compute the running of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant
taking into account the effect of quantum fields with any spin between 0 and 2.
We find that Newton's constant does not vary appreciably but the cosmological
constant can change by many orders of magnitude when one goes from cosmological
scales to typical elementary particle scales. In the extreme infrared, zero
modes drive the cosmological constant to zero.
