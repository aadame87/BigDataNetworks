  We present some important corrections to our work which appeared in Nucl.
Phys. B426 (1994) 534 (hep-th/9402144). Our previous results for the
correlation functions $\langle e^{i\alpha \Phi(x)} e^{i\alpha' \Phi (0) }
\rangle$ were only valid for $\alpha = \alpha'$, due to the fact that we didn't
find the most general solution to the differential equations we derived. Here
we present the solution corresponding to $\alpha \neq \alpha'$.
