  As a system which is known to admit classical wormhole instanton solutions,
Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymmetric tensor theory is revisited. As an
untouched issue, the existence of fermionic zero modes in the background of
classical axionic wormhole spacetime and its physical implications is
addressed. In particular, in the context of a minisuperspace quantum cosmology
model based on this Einstein-KR antisymmetric tensor theory, ``quantum
wormhole'', defined as a state represented by a solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation satisfying an appropriate wormhole boundary condition, is discussed.
An exact, analytic wave function for quantum wormholes is actually found.
Finally, it is proposed that the minisuperspace model based on this theory in
the presence of the cosmological constant may serve as an interesting simple
system displaying an overall picture of entire universe's history from the deep
quantum domain all the way to the classical domain.
