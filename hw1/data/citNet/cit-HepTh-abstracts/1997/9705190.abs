  In this paper we consider features of graviton scattering in Matrix theory
compactified on a 2-torus. The features which interest us can only be
determined by nonperturbative effects in the corresponding 2+1 dimensional
super Yang Mills theory. We show that the superconformal symmetry of strongly
coupled Super Yang Mills Theory in 2+1 dimensions almost determines low energy,
large impact parameter ten dimensional graviton scattering at zero longitudinal
momentum in the Matrix model of IIB string theory. We then show that
amplitudes involving arbitrary transverse momentum transfer are governed by
instanton processes similar to the Polchinski Pouliot process. Finally we
consider the influence of instantons on a conjectured nonrenormalization
theorem. This theorem is violated by instanton processes. Far from being a
problem, this fact is seen to be crucial to the consistency of the IIB
interpretation. We suggest that the SO(8) invariance of strongly coupled SYM
theory may lead to a proof of eleven dimensional Lorentz invariance.
