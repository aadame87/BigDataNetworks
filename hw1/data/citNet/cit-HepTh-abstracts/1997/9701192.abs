  Framework for constructing Fock spaces associated either with certain
solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation or with infinite dimensional
Hecke algebra is presented. For the former case, the quantum deformed
oscillator algebra associated with the solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter
equation is found.
