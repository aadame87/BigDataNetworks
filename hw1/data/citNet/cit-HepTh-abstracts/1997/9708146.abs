  We study a model for two-dimensional skyrmions on a sphere of radius L. Such
model simulates a skyrmion lattice of density W/(2 \pi L^2), where W is the
skyrmion winding number. We show that, to a very good approximation, physical
results depend only on the product \alpha L^4, where \alpha is the strength of
potential term. In the range \alpha L^4 approx. or less than 3 the order
parameter vanishes, there is a uniform distribution of the density over the
whole surface and the energy of the W=2 sector lies above twice the energy of
the W=1 sector. If \alpha L^4 approx. or greater than 6 the order parameter
approaches unity and the density concentrates near one of the poles. Moreover
the disoliton is always bound. We also present a variational solution to the
field equations for which the pure \alpha L^4-dependence is exact. Finally,
some consequences of our results for the Quantum Hall Effect are discussed.
