  Multidimensional cosmological, static spherically symmetric and Euclidean
configurations are described in a unified way for gravity interacting with
several dilatonic fields and antisymmetric forms, associated with electric and
magnetic p-branes. Exact solutions are obtained when certain vectors, built
from the input parameters of the model, are either orthogonal in the
minisuperspace, or form mutually orthogonal subsystems. Some properties of
black-hole solutions are indicated, in particular, a no-hair-type theorem and
restrictions emerging in models with multiple times. From the non-existence of
Lorentzian wormholes, a universal restriction is obtained, applicable to
orthogonal or block-orthogonal subsystems of any p-brane systems. Euclidean
wormhole solutions are found, their actions and radii are explicitly
calculated.
