  We introduce some techniques for making a more global analysis of the
existence of geodesics on a Seiberg-Witten Riemann surface with metric $ds^2 =
|\lambda_{SW}|^2$. Because the existence of such geodesics implies the
existence of BPS states in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, one can use
these methods to study the BPS spectrum in various phases of the Yang-Mills
theory. By way of illustration, we show how, using our new methods, one can
easily recover the known results for the N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) pure
gauge theory, and we show in detail how it also works for the N=2, SU(2)
theory coupled to a massive adjoint matter multiplet.
