  A set of physical operators which are responsible for touching interactions
in the framework of c<1 unitary conformal matter coupled to 2D quantum gravity
is found. As a special case the non-critical bosonic strings are considered.
Some analogies with four dimensional quantum gravity are also discussed, e.g.
creation-annihilation operators for baby universes, Coleman mechanism for the
cosmological constant.
