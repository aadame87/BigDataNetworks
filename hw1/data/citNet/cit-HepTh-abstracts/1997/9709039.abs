  Using the path-integral approach, the quantum massive Thirring and
sine-Gordon models are proven to be equivalent at finite temperature. This
result is an extension of Coleman's proof of the equivalence between both
theories at zero temperature. The usual identifications among the parameters of
these models also remain valid at $T \neq 0$.
