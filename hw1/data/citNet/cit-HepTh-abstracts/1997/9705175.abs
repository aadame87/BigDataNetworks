  We suggest that the (2,0) six dimensional field theory compactified on
$S^1\times K3$ is the Matrix model description of both M-theory on $K3$ and the
Heterotic string on $T^3$. This proposal is different from existing proposals
for the Heterotic theory. Different limits of the base space geometry give the
different space-time interpretations, making M-theory/Heterotic duality
manifest. We also present partial results on Heterotic/F-theory duality.
