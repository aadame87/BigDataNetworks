  Perturbation theory in the nonperturbative QCD vacuum and the non-Abelian
Stokes theorem, representing a Wilson loop in the SU(2) gluodynamics as an
integral over all the orientations in colour space, are applied to a derivation
of the correction to the string effective action in the lowest order in the
coupling constant $g$. This correction is due to the interaction of
perturbative gluons with the string world sheet and affects only the coupling
constant of the rigidity term, while its contribution to the string tension of
the Nambu-Goto term vanishes. The obtained correction to the rigidity coupling
constant multiplicatively depends on the colour "spin" of the representation of
the Wilson loop under consideration and a certain path integral, which includes
the background Wilson loop average.
