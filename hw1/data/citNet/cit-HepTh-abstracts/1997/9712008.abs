  We show that the recently proposed confining string theory describes smooth
surfaces with long-range correlations for the normal components of tangent
vectors. These long-range correlations arise as a consequence of a "frustrated
antiferromagnetic" interaction whose two main features are non-locality and a
negative stiffness.
