  I examine the pair creation of black holes in spacetimes with a cosmological
constant of either sign. I consider cosmological C-metrics and show that the
conical singularities in this metric vanish only for three distinct classes of
black hole metric, two of which have compact event horizons on each spatial
slice. One class is a generalization of the Reissner-Nordstrom (anti) de Sitter
black holes in which the event horizons are the direct product of a null line
with a 2-surface with topology of genus $g$. The other class consists of
neutral black holes whose event horizons are the direct product of a null
conoid with a circle. In the presence of a domain wall, black hole pairs of all
possible types will be pair created for a wide range of mass and charge,
including even negative mass black holes. I determine the relevant instantons
and Euclidean actions for each case. Only for spherical are non-static
solutions possible.
