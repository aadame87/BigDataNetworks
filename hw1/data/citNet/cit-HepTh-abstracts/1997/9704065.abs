  The fusion of Verma modules of the osp(1|2) current algebra is studied. In
the framework of an isotopic formalism, the singular vector decoupling
conditions are analyzed. The fusion rules corresponding to the admissible
representations of the osp(1|2) algebra are determined. A relation between the
characters of these last representations and those corresponding to the minimal
superconformal models is found. A series of equations that relate the
descendants of the highest weight vectors resulting from a fusion of Verma
modules are obtained. Solving these equations the singular vectors of the
theory can be determined.
