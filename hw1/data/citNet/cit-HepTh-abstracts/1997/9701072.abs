  We consider the method due to Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin (BFFT)
that makes the conversion of second-class constraints into first-class ones for
the case of nonlinear theories. We first present a general analysis of an
attempt to simplify the method, showing the conditions that must be fulfilled
in order to have first-class constraints for nonlinear theories but that are
linear in the auxiliary variables. There are cases where this simplification
cannot be done and the full BFFT method has to be used. However, in the way the
method is formulated, we show with details that it is not practicable to be
done. Finally, we speculate on a solution for these problems.
