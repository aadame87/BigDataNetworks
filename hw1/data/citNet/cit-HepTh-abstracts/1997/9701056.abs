  We discuss the physics of topological vortices moving on an arbitrary surface
M in a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in which the gauge group G breaks to a finite
subgroup H. We concentrate on the case where M is compact and/or nonorientable.
Interesting new features arise which have no analog on the plane. The
consequences for the quantum statistics of vortices are discussed, particularly
when H is nonabelian.
