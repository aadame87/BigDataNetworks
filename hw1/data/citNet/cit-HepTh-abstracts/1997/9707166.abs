  This extended write-up of a talk gives an introductory survey of mathematical
problems of the quantization of gauge systems. Using the Schwinger model as an
exactly tractable but nontrivial example which exhibits general features of
gauge quantum field theory, I cover the following subjects: The axiomatics of
quantum field theory, formulation of quantum field theory in terms of Wightman
functions, reconstruction of the state space, the local formulation of gauge
theories, indefiniteness of the Wightman functions in general and in the
special case of the Schwinger model, the state space of the Schwinger model,
special features of the model. New results are contained in the Mathematical
Appendix, where I consider in an abstract setting the Pontrjagin space
structure of a special class of indefinite inner product spaces - the so called
quasi-positive ones. This is motivated by the indefinite inner product space
structure appearing in the above context and generalizes results of Morchio and
Strocchi [J. Math. Phys. 31 (1990) 1467], and Dubin and Tarski [J. Math. Phys.
7 (1966) 574].
