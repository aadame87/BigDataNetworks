  We prove that the Calogero-Sutherland Model with reflections (the BC_N model)
possesses a property of duality relating the eigenfunctions of two Hamiltonians
with different coupling constants. We obtain a generating function for their
polynomial eigenfunctions, the generalized Jacobi polynomials. The symmetry of
the wave-functions for certain particular cases (associated to the root systems
of the classical Lie groups B_N, C_N and D_N) is also discussed.
