  We consider configurations of D6-branes with D0-brane charge given by recent
work of Taylor and compute interaction potentials with various D-brane probes
using a 1-loop open string calculation. These results are compared to a
supergravity calculation using the solution given by Sheinblatt of an extremal
black hole carrying 0-brane and 6-brane charge.
