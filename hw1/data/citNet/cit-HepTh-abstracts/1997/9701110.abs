Title: Non-Abelian Eikonal Formalism in QCD_4

  Using a new technique for the extraction of leading-log energy dependence
from the non-Abelian portion of quark-line interactions, hadronic scattering
amplitudes may be represented in terms of functional integrals over gluonic
material exchanged between scattering quarks. If that material is further
represented by a condensed tube of gluonic flux (obtained by dimensional
transmutation), these functional integrals will produce effective propagators
corresponding to plasma oscillations, or ``condensons'', in this condensed
gluonic material. These condensons yield a non-zero, non-tachyonic, finite,
gauge-invariant contribution only when the gluonic flux tube corresponds to a
``rigid string'' of negligible thickness, so that this formalism provides a
natural mechanism for a ``dynamical string'' in QCD4. Summation over a subset of
such relevant condensons (at least in SU(2)) generates a form of the
Donnachie-Landshoff Pomeron for the scattering amplitude. Other, non-condensate
approaches are also available.
