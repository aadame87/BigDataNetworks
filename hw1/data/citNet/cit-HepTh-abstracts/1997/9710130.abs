  Singular configuration of an external static magnetic field in the form of a
string polarizes vacuum in the secondly quantized theory on a plane which is
orthogonal to the string axis. We consider the most general boundary conditions
at the punctured singular point, which are compatible with the self-adjointness
of the two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian. The dependence of the induced vacuum
quantum numbers on the self-adjoint extension parameter and the flux of the
string is determined.
