  We study the one-loop effective action for a generic two-dimensional dilaton
gravity theory conformally coupled to $N$ matter fields. We obtain an explicit
expression for the effective action in the weak-coupling limit under a suitable
restriction of the dilaton potential asymptotics. Our result applies to the
CGHS model as well as to the spherically symmetric general relativity. The
effective action is obtained by using the background-field method, and we take
into account the loop contributions from all the fields in the classical action
and from the ghosts. In the large-$N$ limit, and after an appropriate field
redefinition, the one-loop correction takes the form of the Polyakov-Liouville
action.
