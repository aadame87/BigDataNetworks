  The (generalized) WDVV equations for the prepotentials in $2d$ topological
and $4,5d$ Seiberg-Witten models are covariant with respect to non-linear
transformations, described in terms of solutions of associated linear problem.
Both time-variables and the prepotential change non-trivially, but period
matrix (prepotential's second derivatives) remains intact.
