  The Matrix Darboux-Toda Mapping is represented as a product of a number of
commutative mappings. The Matrix Davey-Stewartson Hierarchy is invariant with
respect to each of these mappings. We thus introduce an entirely new type of
discrete transformation for this hierarchy. The discrete transformation for the
Vector Nonlinear Shrodinger System coincides with one of the mappings under
necessary reduction conditions.
