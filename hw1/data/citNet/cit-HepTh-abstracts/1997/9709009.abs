  We investigate the geometric interpretation of the Standard Model based on
noncommutative geometry. Neglecting the $S_0$-reality symmetry one may
introduce leptoquarks into the model. We give a detailed discussion of the
consequences (both for the Connes-Lott and the spectral action) and compare the
results with physical bounds. Our result is that in either case one contradicts
the experimental results.
