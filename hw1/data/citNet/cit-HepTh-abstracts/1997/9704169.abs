  Within the general framework of Liouville string theory, we construct a model
for quantum D-brane fluctuations in the space-time background through which
light closed-string states propagate. The model is based on monopole and vortex
defects on the world sheet, which have been discussed previously in a treatment
of 1+1-dimensional black-hole fluctuations in the space-time background, and
makes use of a T-duality transformation to relate formulations with Neumann and
Dirichlet boundary conditions. In accordance with previous general arguments,
we derive an open quantum-mechanical description of this D-brane foam which
embodies momentum and energy conservation and small mean energy fluctuations.
Quantum decoherence effects appear at a rate consistent with previous
estimates.
