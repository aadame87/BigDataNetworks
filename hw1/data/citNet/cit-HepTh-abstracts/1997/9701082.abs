  We study axion-dilaton cosmologies derived from the low-energy string
effective action. We present the classical homogeneous
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions and derive the semi-classical perturbation
spectra in the dilaton, axion and moduli fields in the pre-Big Bang scenario.
By constructing the unique S-duality invariant field perturbations for the
axion and dilaton fields we derive S-duality invariant solutions, valid when
the axion field is time-dependent as well as in a dilaton-vacuum cosmology.
Whereas the dilaton and moduli fields have steep blue perturbation spectra
(with spectral index n=4) we find that the axion spectrum depends upon the
expansion rate of the internal dimensions (0.54<n<4) which allows
scale-invariant (n=1) spectra. We note that for n<1 the metric is non-singular
in the conformal frame in which the axion is minimally coupled.
