  We introduce a complete set of gauge-invariant variables and a generalized
Born-Oppenheimer formulation to search for normalizable zero-energy asymptotic
solutions of the Schrodinger equation of SU(2) matrix theory. The asymptotic
method gives only ground state candidates, which must be further tested for
global stability. Our results include a set of such ground state candidates,
including one state which is a singlet under spin(9).
