  The first two Hamiltonian structures and the recursion operator connecting
all evolution systems and Hamiltonian structures of the N=2 supersymmetric
(n,m)-GNLS hierarchy are constructed in terms of N=2 superfields in two
different superfield bases with local evolution equations. Their bosonic limits
are studied in detail. New local and nonlocal bosonic and fermionic integrals
both for the N=2 supersymmetric (n,m)-GNLS hierarchy and its bosonic
counterparts are derived. As an example, in the n=1, m=1 case, the algebra and
the symmetry transformations for some of them are worked out and a rich N=4
supersymmetry structure is uncovered.
