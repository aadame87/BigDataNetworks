Title: Duality in Quantum Field Theory (and String Theory)
Authors: Luis Alvarez-Gaume and Frederic Zamora
Comments: 38 pages, 7 figures, LaTeX, revtex, two references added. Based on a
  lectures delivered by L. A.-G. at `The Workshop on Fundamental Particles and
  Interactions', held in Vanderbilt University, and CERN-La Plata-Santiago de
  Compostela School of Physics, both in May 1997

  These lectures give an introduction to duality in Quantum Field Theory. We
discuss the phases of gauge theories and the implications of the
electric-magnetic duality transformation to describe the mechanism of
confinement. We review the exact results of N=1 supersymmetric QCD and the
Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 super Yang-Mills. Some of its extensions to
String Theory are also briefly discussed.
