  The adiabatic evolution of two doubly-degenerate (Kramers) levels is
considered. The general five-parameter Hamiltonian describing the system is
obtained and shown to be equivalent to one used in the $\Gamma_8
\otimes(\tau_2\oplus\epsilon)$ Jahn-Teller system. It is shown explicitly that
the resulting SU(2) non-Abelian geometric vector potential is that of the
(SO(5) symmetric) SU(2) instanton. Various forms of the potentials are
discussed.
