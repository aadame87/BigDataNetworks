  Using an infinite number of fields, we construct actions for D=4 self-dual
Yang-Mills with manifest Lorentz invariance and for D=10 super-Yang-Mills with
manifest super-Poincar\'e invariance. These actions are generalizations of the
covariant action for the D=2 chiral boson which was first studied by McClain,
Wu, Yu and Wotzasek.
