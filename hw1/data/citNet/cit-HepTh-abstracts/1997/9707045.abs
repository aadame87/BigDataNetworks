  We obtain the exact operator solution of two-dimensional quantum Born-Infeld
theory. This theory has a Lagrangian density non-polynomial in the fundamental
fields. So this analysis might shed some light on the analysis of
non-perturbative effects of field theories. We find the new exact soluble class
of quantum field theories.
