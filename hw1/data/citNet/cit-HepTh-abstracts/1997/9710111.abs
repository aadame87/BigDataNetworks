Title: Quasi exactly solvable matrix models in sl(n)
Authors: Yves Brihaye, Piotr Kosinski
Notes: LaTeX, 8 pages
Report-no: UMH-97/8
\\
  We reconsider the quasi exactly solvable matrix models constructed recently
by R. Zhdanov. The 2$\times$2 matrix operators representing the algebra sl(2)
are generalized to matrices of arbitrary dimension and a similar construction
is achieved for the algebra sl(n).
