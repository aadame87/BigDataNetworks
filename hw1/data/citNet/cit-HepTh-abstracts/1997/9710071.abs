  We analyse the Spherical Model with frustration induced by an external gauge
field. In infinite dimensions, this has been recently mapped onto a problem of
q-deformed oscillators, whose real parameter q measures the frustration. We
find the analytic solution of this model by suitably representing the
q-oscillator algebra with q-Hermite polynomials. We also present a related
Matrix Model which possesses the same diagrammatic expansion in the planar
approximation. Its interaction potential is oscillating at infinity with period
log(q), and may lead to interesting metastability phenomena beyond the planar
approximation. The Spherical Model is similarly q-periodic, but does not
exhibit such phenomena: actually its low-temperature phase is not glassy and
depends smoothly on q.
