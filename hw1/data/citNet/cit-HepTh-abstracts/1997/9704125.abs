  We construct a system of bosonic closed string field theory coupled to a
D-brane. The interaction between the D-brane and closed string field is
introduced using the boundary state which is a function of constant field
strength $F_{\mu\nu}$ and the tilt $\theta_\mu^i$ of the D-brane. We find that
the gauge invariance requirement on the system determines the
$(F_{\mu\nu},\theta_\mu^i)$-dependence of the normalization factor of the
boundary state as well as the form of the purely $(F_{\mu\nu},\theta_\mu^i)$
term of the action. Correspondence between the action in the present formalism
and the low energy effective action (bulk + D-brane actions) in the
$\sigma$-model approach is studied.
