  We examine the geometry near the event horizon of a family of black string
solutions with traveling waves. It has previously been shown that the metric is
continuous there. Contrary to expectations, we find that the geometry is not
smooth, and the horizon becomes singular whenever a wave is present. Both five
dimensional and six dimensional black strings are considered with similar
results.
