  We shortly illustrate how the field-theoretic approach to critical phenomena
takes place in the more complete Wilson theory of renormalization and
qualitatively discuss its domain of validity. By the way, we suggest that the
differential renormalization functions (like the beta-function) of the
perturbative scalar theory in four dimensions should be Borel summable provided
they are calculated within a minimal subtraction scheme.
