  A superconnection is a supermatrix whose even part contains the
gauge-potential one-forms of a local gauge group, while the odd parts contain
the (0-form) Higgs fields; the combined grading is thus odd everywhere. We
demonstrate that the simple supergroup ${\bar P}(4,R)$ (rank=3) in Kac'
classification (even subgroup $\bar {SL}(4,R)$) prverline {SL}(4,R)$) provides
for the most economical spontaneous breaking of $\bar{SL}(4,R)$ as gauge group,
leaving just local $\bar{SO}(1,3)$ unbroken. As a result, post-Riemannian SKY
gravity yields Einstein's theory as a low-energy (longer range) effective
theory. The theory is renormalizable and may be unitary.
