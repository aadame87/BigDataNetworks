  Nonabelian gauge theories with a generic background field A_mu in nonlinear
gauges due to Delbourgo and Jarvis are investigated. The A_mu-dependence is
completely determined by the help of a linear differential equation which
obtaines from the Kluberg-Stern-Zuber and the Lee identity. Its integration
leads to a relation between the one-particle irreducible vertex functional in
the background field A_mu and the corresponding functional for A_mu = 0. An
analogous relation holds for the generating functional of the complete Green
functions which, after restriction to physical Green functions, is used to
confirm a result obtained by Rouet in the case of linear background gauge.
