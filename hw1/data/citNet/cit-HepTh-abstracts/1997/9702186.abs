  It is known that the high-energy quark-quark scattering amplitude can be
described by the expectation value of two lightlike Wilson lines, running along
the classical trajectories of the two colliding particles. Generalizing the
results of a previous paper, we give here the general proof that the
expectation value of two infinite Wilson lines, forming a certain hyperbolic
angle in Minkowski space-time, and the expectation value of two infinite
Euclidean Wilson lines, forming a certain angle in Euclidean four-space, are
connected by an analytic continuation in the angular variables. This result
could be used to evaluate the high-energy scattering amplitude directly on the
lattice.
