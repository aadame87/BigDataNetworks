Title: Quantum properties of general gauge theories with composite and external
  fields
Authors: S. Falkenberg, B. Geyer, and P. Moshin
Comments: 24 pages, LATEX, slightly changed to clarify the essential new aspect
  concerning composite fields depending on external ones; added formulas
  showing lack of (generalized) nilpotence of operators appearing in the Ward
  identities

  The generating functionals of Green's functions with composite and external
fields are considered in the framework of BV and BLT quantization methods for
general gauge theories. The corresponding Ward identities are derived and the
gauge dependence is investigated
