  A survey is given of the formulation of a $\sigma$-model describing an open
string moving in general target space background fields and coupling to both a
matrix-valued D-brane position and a matrix-valued gauge field on the D-brane.
The equations of motion for the D-brane and the gauge field are derived from
the conformal invariance condition on the string world sheet in lowest order of
$\ap$. The ordering problem of the involved matrices is solved. In addition to
our previous work we discuss a conflict between the classical T-duality rules
and renormalization. The calculation of the RG $\beta$-functions does not yield
the mass term obtained by formal application of these rules in the case of
target space separated D-brane copies.
