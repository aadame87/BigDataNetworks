Title: Scaling Laws in Turbulence
Authors: Krzysztof Gawedzki
Comments: 10 pages, latex, no figures
Report-no: IHES/P/97/66
\\
  The largely open problem of scaling laws in fully developed turbulence is
discussed, with the stress put on similarities and differences with scaling in
field theory. A soluble model of the passive advection is examined in more
detail in order to illustrate the principal ideas.
