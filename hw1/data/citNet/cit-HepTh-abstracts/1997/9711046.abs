  We evaluate one-loop finite-time amplitudes for graviton scattering in Matrix
theory and compare to the corresponding amplitudes in supergravity. We find
agreement for arbitrary time intervals at leading order in distance, providing
a functional agreement between supergravity and Matrix theory. At subleading
order, we find corrections to the effective potential found from previous phase
shift calculations in Matrix theory.
