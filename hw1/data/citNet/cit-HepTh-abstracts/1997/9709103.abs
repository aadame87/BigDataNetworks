  We derive the fusion rules for a basic series of admissible representations
of $\hat{sl}(3)$ at fractional level $3/p-3$. The formulae admit an
interpretation in terms of the affine Weyl group introduced by Kac and
Wakimoto. It replaces the ordinary affine Weyl group in the analogous formula
for the fusion rules multiplicities of integrable representations. Elements of
the representation theory of a hidden finite dimensional graded algebra behind
the admissible representations are briefly discussed.
