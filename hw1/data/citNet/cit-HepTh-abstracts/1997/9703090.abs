  A Galilean Chern-Simons field theory is formulated for the case of two
interacting spin-1/2 fields of distinct masses M and M'. A method for the
construction of states containing N particles of mass M and N' particles of
mass M' is given which is subsequently used to display equivalence to the
spin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm effect in the N = N' =1 sector of the model. The latter
is then studied in perturbation theory to determine whether there are
divergences in the fourth order (one loop) diagram. It is found that the
contribution of that order is finite (and vanishing) for the case of parallel
spin projections while the antiparallel case displays divergences which are
known to characterize the spin zero case in field theory as well as in quantum
mechanics.
