  We show how the usual chiral perturbation theory description of
phenomenological pion physics admits an interpretation as a low-energy
string-like model associated with QCD. By naive and straightforward
generalization within the context of a new class of supersymmetrical models, it
is shown that this string-like structure admits a 4D, N = 1 supersymmetrical
extension. The presence of a WZNW term in the model implies modifications of
certain higher order processes involving the ordinary SU(3) pion octet.
