  We study brane configurations which correspond to N=1 field theories in four
dimensions. By inverting the order of the NS 5-branes and D6-branes, a check on
dualities in four dimensional theories can be made.
 We consider a brane configuration which yields electric/magnetic duality for
gauge theories with $SO(N_{c1})\times Sp(N_{c2})$ product gauge group.
 We also discuss the possible extension to any alternating product of SO and Sp
groups. The new features arising from the intersection of the NS 5-branes on
the orientifold play a crucial role in our construction.
