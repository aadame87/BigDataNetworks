  We study the most general renormalization transformations for the first-order
formulation of the Yang-Mills theory. We analyze, in particular, the trivial
sector of the BRST cohomology of two possible formulations of the model: the
standard one and the extended one. The latter is a promising starting point for
the interpretation of the Yang-Mills theory as a deformation of the
topological BF theory. This work is a necessary preliminary step towards any
perturbative calculation, and completes some recently obtained results.
