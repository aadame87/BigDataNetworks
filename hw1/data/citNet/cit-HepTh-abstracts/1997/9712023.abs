  We present an explicit method for translating between the linear sigma model
and the spectral cover description of SU(r) stable bundles over an elliptically
fibered Calabi-Yau manifold. We use this to investigate the 4-dimensional
duality between (0,2) heterotic and F-theory compactifications. We indirectly
find that much interesting heterotic information must be contained in the
`spectral bundle' and in its dual description as a gauge theory on multiple
F-theory 7-branes.
 A by-product of these efforts is a method for analyzing semistability and the
splitting type of vector bundles over an elliptic curve given as the sheaf
cohomology of a monad.
