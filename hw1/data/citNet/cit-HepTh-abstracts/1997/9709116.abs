  Using linearized superfields, $R^4$ terms in the Type II superstring
effective action compactified on $T^2$ are constructed as integrals in N=2 D=8
superspace. The structure of these superspace integrals allows a simple proof
of the $R^4$ non-renormalization theorems which were first conjectured by Green
and Gutperle.
