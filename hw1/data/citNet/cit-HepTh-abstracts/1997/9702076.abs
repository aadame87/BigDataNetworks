  We calculate classical cross sections for absorption of massless scalars by
the extremal 3-branes of type IIB theory, and by the extremal 2- and 5-branes
of M-theory. The results are compared with corresponding calculations in the
world volume effective theories. For all three cases we find agreement in the
scaling with the energy and the number of coincident branes. For 3-branes,
whose stringy description is known in detail in terms of multiple D-branes, the
string theoretic absorption cross section for low energy dilatons is in exact
agreement with the classical gravity. This suggests that scattering from
extremal 3-branes is a unitary process well described by perturbative string
theory.
