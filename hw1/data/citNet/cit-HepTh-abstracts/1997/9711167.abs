  A consistent local approach to the study of interacting relativistic fermion
systems with a condensation of bare particles in its ground or vacuum state,
which may has a finite matter density, is developed. The attention is payed to
some of the not so well explored quantum aspects that survive the thermodynamic
limit. A 4-vector local field, called the primary statistical gauge field, and
a statistical blocking parameter are introduced for a consistent treatment of
the problem. The effects of random fluctuations of the fields on local
observables are discussed. It is found that quasiparticle contributions are not
sufficient to saturate local observables. The property of the primary
statistical gauge field are discussed in some detail. Two models for the strong
interaction are then introduced and studied using the general framework
developed. Four possible phases for these models are found. The possibility of
spontaneous CP violation and local fermion creation in two of the four phases
is revealed. The implications of the finding on our understanding of some of
the strong interaction processes are discussed.
