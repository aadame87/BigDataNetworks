  In this paper we study duality properties of the M(atrix) theory compactified
on a circle. We establish the equivalence of this theory to the strong coupling
limit of type IIB string theory compactified on a circle. In the M(atrix)
theory context, our major evidence for this duality consists of identifying the
BPS states of IIB strings in the spectrum and finding the remnant symmetry of
SL(2,Z) and the associated tau moduli. By this IIB/M duality, a number of
insights are gained into the physics of longitudinal membranes in the infinite
momentum frame. We also point out an accidental affine Lie symmetry in the
theory.
