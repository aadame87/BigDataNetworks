  A combined model of the Kerr spinning particle and superparticle is
considered. The structure of the Kerr geometry is presented in a complex form
as being created by a complex source. A natural supergeneralization of this
construction is obtained corresponding to a complex "supersource". Peforming a
supershift to the Kerr and Kerr-Sen solutions we obtain metrics of supergravity
black holes with a nonlinear realization of broken supersymmetry.
