  Exact solutions to the low-energy effective action of the four-dimensional,
N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with matter (including N=2 super-QCD) are
discussed from the three different viewpoints: (i) instanton calculus, (ii) N=2
harmonic superspace, and (iii) M theory. The emphasis is made on the
foundations of all three approaches and their relationship.
