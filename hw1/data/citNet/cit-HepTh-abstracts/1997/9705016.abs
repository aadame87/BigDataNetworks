  It has been shown recently that the toroidally compactified type IIB string
effective action possesses an SL(2, R) invariance as a consequence of the
corresponding symmetry in ten dimensions when the self-dual five-form field
strength is set to zero. By working in the string frame we clarify how a Z$_2$
subgroup of this SL(2, R) group responsible for producing the strong-weak
coupling duality in the ten dimensional theory produces the same symmetry for
the reduced theory. In the absence of the full covariant action of type IIB
supergravity theory, we show that the T-dual version of type IIA string
effective action (including the R-R terms) in D=9 also possesses the SL(2, R)
invariance indicating that this symmetry is present for the full type IIB
string effective action compactified on torus.
