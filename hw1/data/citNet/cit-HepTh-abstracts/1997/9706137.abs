  A specific Friedmann-Roberstson-Walker (FRW) model derived from the theory of
N=1 supergravity with gauged supermatter is considered in this paper. The
supermatter content is restricted to a vector supermultiplet. The corresponding
Lorentz and supersymmetry quantum constraints are then derived. Non-trivial
solutions are subsquently found. A no-boundary solution is identified while
another state may be interpreted as a wormhole solution.
