  We examine the weak coupling limit of Euclidean SU(n) gauge theory in
covariant gauges. Following an earlier suggestion, an equivariant
BRST-construction is used to define the continuum theory on a finite torus. The
equivariant gauge fixing introduces constant ghost fields as moduli of the
model. We study the parameter- and moduli- space perturbatively. For $n_f \leq
n$ quark flavors, the moduli flow to a non-trivial fixed point in certain
critical covariant gauges and the one-loop effective potential indicates that
the global SU(n) color symmetry of the gauge fixed model is spontaneously
broken to $U(1)^{n-1}$. Ward identities and renormalization group arguments
imply that the longitudinal gauge boson propagator at long range is dominated
by $n(n-1)$ Goldstone bosons in these critical covariant gauges. In the large
$n$ limit, we derive a nonlinear integral equation for the expectation value of
large Wilson loops assuming that the exchange of Goldstone bosons dominates the
interaction at long range in critical covariant gauges. We find numerically
that the expectation value of large circular Wilson loops decreases
exponentially with the enclosed area in the absence of dynamical fermions. The
gauge invariance of this mechanism for confinement in critical covariant gauges
is discussed.
