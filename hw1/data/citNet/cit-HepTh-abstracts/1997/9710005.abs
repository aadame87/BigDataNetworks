  We present a matrix model which interpolates between type IIA and type IIB NS
five-branes. The matrix description involves a three-dimensional bulk quantum
field theory interacting with impurities localized in one spatial direction. We
obtain a dual matrix formulation for the exotic six-dimensional theory on
coincident type IIB NS five-branes by studying the T-dual description in terms
of Kaluza-Klein monopoles in type IIA string theory. After decoupling the bulk
physics, the matrix description reduces to the conformal field theory of the
Coulomb branch for the type IIA matrix string propagating on certain singular
spaces. In many ways, this dual realization of superconformal theories is the
two-dimensional analogue of three-dimensional mirror symmetry.
