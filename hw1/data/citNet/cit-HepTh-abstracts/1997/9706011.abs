  models

  the conclusions remain the same

  In this paper the large $N$ limit of one hermitian matrix models coupled to
an external matrix is considered. It is shown that in the large N limit the
number of degrees of freedom are reduced to be order N even though it is order
$N^{2}$ for finite N. It is claimed that this result is the origin of the
factorization of observables in the path integral formalism.
