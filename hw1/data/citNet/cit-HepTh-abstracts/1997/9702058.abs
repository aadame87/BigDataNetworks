  The plot of allowed p and D values for p-brane solitons in D-dimensional
supergravity is the same whether the solitons are extremal or non-extremal. One
of the useful tools for relating different points on the plot is vertical
dimensional reduction, which is possible if periodic arrays of p-brane solitons
can be constructed. This is straightforward for extremal p-branes, since the
no-force condition allows arbitrary multi-centre solutions to be constructed in
terms of a general harmonic function on the transverse space. This has also
been shown to be possible in the special case of non-extremal black holes in
D=4 arrayed along an axis. In this paper, we extend previous results to include
multi-scalar black holes, and dyonic black holes. We also consider their
oxidation to higher dimensions, and we discuss general procedures for
constructing the solutions, and studying their symmetries.
