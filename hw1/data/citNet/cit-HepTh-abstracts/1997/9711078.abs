  We consider membranes of spherical topology in uncompactified Matrix theory.
In general for large membranes Matrix theory reproduces the classical membrane
dynamics up to 1/N corrections; for certain simple membrane configurations, the
equations of motion agree exactly at finite N. We derive a general formula for
the one-loop Matrix potential between two finite-sized objects at large
separations. Applied to a graviton interacting with a round spherical membrane,
we show that the Matrix potential agrees with the naive supergravity potential
for large N, but differs at subleading orders in N. The result is quite
general: we prove a pair of theorems showing that for large N, after removing
the effects of gravitational radiation, the one-loop potential between
classical Matrix configurations agrees with the long-distance potential
expected from supergravity. As a spherical membrane shrinks, it eventually
becomes a black hole. This provides a natural framework to study Schwarzschild
black holes in Matrix theory.
