  We apply the string inspired worldline formalism to the calculation of the
higher derivative expansion of one-loop effective actions in non-Abelian gauge
theory. For this purpose, we have completely computerized the method, using the
symbolic manipulation programs FORM, PERL and M. Explicit results are given to
sixth order in the inverse mass expansion, reduced to a minimal basis of
invariants specifically adapted to the method. Detailed comparisons are made
with other gauge-invariant algorithms for calculating the same expansion. This
includes an explicit check of all coefficients up to fifth order.
