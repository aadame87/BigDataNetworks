  We give a confirmation of U-duality of type II superstring by discussing mass
spectrum of the BPS states. We first evaluate the mass spectrum of BPS solitons
with one kind of R-R charges. Our analysis is based on the 1-loop effective
action of D-brane, which is known as ``Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action'', and
the fact that BPS states correspond to the SUSY cycles with minimal volumes. We
show the mass formula derived in this manner is completely fitted with that
given by U-duality. We further discuss the cases of BPS solitons possessing
several kinds of R-R charges. These are cases of ``intersecting D-branes'',
which cannot be described by simple DBI actions. We claim that, in these cases,
higher loop corrections should be incorporated as binding energies between the
branes. It is remarkable that the summation of the contributions from all loops
reproduces the correct mass formula predicted by U-duality.
