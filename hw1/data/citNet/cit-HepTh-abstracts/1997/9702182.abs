  We seek to clarify some of the physical aspects of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider
models. This important class of models was presented as a relativistic
generalisation of the Calogero-Moser models but, as we shall argue, this
description is misleading. It is far better to simply view the models as a
one-parameter generalisation of Calogero-Moser models. By viewing the models as
describing certain eigenvalue motions we can appreciate the generic nature of
the models.
