  We describe a dynamical worldsheet origin for the Lagrangian describing the
low-energy dynamics of a system of parallel D-branes. We show how matrix-valued
collective coordinate fields for the D-branes naturally arise as couplings of a
worldsheet sigma-model, and that the quantum dynamics require that these
couplings be mutually noncommutative. We show that the low-energy effective
action for the sigma-model couplings describes the propagation of an open
string in the background of the multiple D-brane configuration, in which all
string interactions between the constituent branes are integrated out and the
genus expansion is taken into account, with a matrix-valued coupling. The
effective field theory is governed by the non-abelian Born-Infeld target space
action which leads to the standard one for D-brane field theory.
