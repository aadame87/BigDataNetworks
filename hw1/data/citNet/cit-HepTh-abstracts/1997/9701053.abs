Title: Classical and quantum aspects of 4 dimensional black holes
Authors: Klaus Behrndt
Comments: 12 pages, 7 figure, LaTeX, small corrections

  In this talk I address some aspects in the recent developments for N=2 black
holes in 4 dimensions. I restrict myself on axion-free solutions that can
classically be related to intersections of isotropic $D$- or $M$-branes. After
reviewing of some classical properties I include corrections coming from a
general cubic prepotential. On the heterotic side these are quantum corrections
for these black hole solutions. Finally, I discuss a microscopic interpretation
of the entropy for the extremal as well as near-extremal black hole.
