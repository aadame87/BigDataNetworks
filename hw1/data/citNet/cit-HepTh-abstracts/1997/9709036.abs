  We discuss the quantum Lax-Phillips theory of scattering and unstable
systems. In this framework, the decay of an unstable system is described by a
semigroup. The spectrum of the generator of the semigroup corresponds to the
singularities of the Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix. In the case of discrete (complex)
spectrum of the generator of the semigroup, associated with resonances, the
decay law is exactly exponential. The states corresponding to these resonances
(eigenfunctions of the generator of the semigroup) lie in the Lax-Phillips
Hilbert space, and therefore all physical properties of the resonant states can
be computed.
  We show that the Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix is unitarily related to the
$S$-matrix of standard scattering theory by a unitary transformation
parametrized by the spectral variable $\sigma$ of the Lax-Phillips theory.
Analytic continuation in $\sigma$ has some of the properties of a method
developed some time ago for application to dilation analytic potentials.
  We work out an illustrative example using a Lee-Friedrichs model for the
underlying dynamical system.
