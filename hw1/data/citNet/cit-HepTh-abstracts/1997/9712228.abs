  We derive the classical transport equation, in scalar field theory with a
V(phi) interaction, from the equation of motion for the quantum field. We
obtain a very simple, but iterative, expression for the effective action which
generates all the n-point Green functions in the high-temperature limit. An
explicit closed form is given in the static case.
