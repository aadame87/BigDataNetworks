  We show that various disconnected components of the moduli space of
superstring vacua with 16 supercharges admit a rationale in terms of BPS
un-orientifolds, i.e. type I toroidal compactifications with constant
non-vanishing but quantized vacuum expectation values of the NS-NS
antisymmetric tensor. These include various heterotic vacua with reduced rank,
known as CHL strings, and their dual type II (2,2) superstrings below D=6. Type
I vacua without open strings allow for an interpretation of several
disconnected components with N_V=10-D. An adiabatic argument relates these
unconventional type I superstrings to type II (4,0) superstrings without
D-branes. The latter are connected by U-duality below D=6 to type II (2,2)
superstrings. We also comment on the relation between some of these vacua and
compactifications of the putative M-theory on unorientable manifolds as well as
F-theory vacua.
