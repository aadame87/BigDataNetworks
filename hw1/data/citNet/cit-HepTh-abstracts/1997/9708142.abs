  The black hole solutions to Einstein's vacuum field equations are also
solutions to the equations of motion of the low energy limit of superstring
theory. At the same time, string theory boasts a much broader and richer
collection of black hole solutions. Fortunately, string theories also possess a
remarkable set of duality symmetries relating states within and between
different string theories. These duality symmetries can be exploited to
construct new black hole solutions from known solutions, giving us powerful
tools with which to explore the black hole solutions of string theory. Here we
introduce and demonstrate these techniques of solution generating.
