  Connes' view at Yang-Mills theories is reviewed with special emphasis on the
gauge invariant scalar product. This landscape is shown to contain Chamseddine
and Connes' noncommutative extension of general relativity restricted to flat
space-time, if the top mass is between 172 and 204 GeV. Then the Higgs mass is
between 188 and 201 GeV.
