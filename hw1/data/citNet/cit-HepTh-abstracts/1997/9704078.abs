  We present simple diagrammatic rules to write down Euclidean n-point
functions at finite temperature directly in terms of 3-dimensional momentum
integrals, without ever performing a single Matsubara sum. The rules can be
understood as describing the interaction of the external particles with those
of the thermal bath.
