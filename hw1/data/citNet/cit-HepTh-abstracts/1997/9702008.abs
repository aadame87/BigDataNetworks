  The component form of the equations of motion for the 5-brane in
eleven-dimensions is derived from the superspace equations. These equations are
fully covariant in six-dimensions. It is shown that double-dimensional
reduction of the bosonic equations gives the equations of motion for a 4-brane
in ten dimensions governed by the Born-Infeld action.
