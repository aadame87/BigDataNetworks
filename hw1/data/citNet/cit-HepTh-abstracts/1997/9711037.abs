  We study field theories in the limit that a compactified dimension becomes
lightlike. In almost all cases the amplitudes at each order of perturbation
theory diverge in the limit, due to strong interactions among the longitudinal
zero modes. The lightlike limit generally exists nonperturbatively, but is more
complicated than might have been assumed. Some implications for the matrix
theory conjecture are discussed.
