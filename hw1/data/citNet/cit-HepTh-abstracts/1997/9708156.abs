Title: Relativistic Stationary Schrodinger Equation for Many Particle System
  and Its Applications
Authors: Guang-Jiong Ni

  Basing on the fundamental symmetry that the space-time inversion is
equivalent to particle-antiparticle transformation, a relativistic modification
on the stationary Schrodinger equation for many-particle system is made. The
eigenvalue in the center of mass system is no longer equal to the negative of
binding energy simply. The possible applications in various fields (e.g. the
model of quarkonium) are discussed.
