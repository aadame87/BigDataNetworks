  Negative dimensional integration is a step further dimensional regularization
ideas. In this approach, based on the principle of analytic continuation,
Feynman integrals are polynomial ones and for this reason very simple to
handle, contrary to the usual parametric ones. The result of the integral
worked out in $D<0$ must be analytically continued again --- of course --- to
real physical world, $D>0$, and this step presents no difficulties. We consider
four two-loop three-point vertex diagrams with arbitrary exponents of
propagators and dimension. These original results give the correct well-known
particular cases where the exponents of propagators are equal to unity.
