  We compute the greybody factors for classical black holes in a domain where
two kinds of charges and their anticharges are excited by the extra energy
over extremality. We compare the result to the greybody factors expected from
an effective string model which was earlier shown to give the correct
entropy. In the regime where the left and right moving temperatures are much
smaller than the square root of the effective string tension, we find a
non-trivial greybody factor which agrees with the effective string model.
However, if the temperatures are comparable with the square root of the
effective string tension, the greybody factors agree only at the leading
order in energy. Nevertheless, there are several interesting relations
between the two results, suggesting that a modification of the effective
string model might lead to better agreement.
