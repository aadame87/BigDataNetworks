  We interpret instantons on a torus with twisted boundary conditions, in terms
of bound states of branes. The interplay between the SU(N) and U(1) parts
of the U(N) theory of N 4-branes allows the construction of a variety of
bound states. The SU(N) and U(1) parts can contribute fractional amounts to
the total instanton number which is integral. The geometry of non-self
intersecting two-cycles in $T^4$ sheds some light on a number of properties of
these solutions.
