  Type-IIB supersymmetric theories have an SL(2,Z) invariance, known as
U-duality, which controls the non-perturbative behavior of the theory. Under
SL(2,Z) the supercharges are doublets, implying that the bosonic charges would
be singlets or triplets. However, among the bosonic charges there are doublet
strings and doublet fivebranes which are in conflict with the doublet property
of the supercharges. It is shown that the conflict is resolved by structure
constants that depend on moduli, such as the tau parameter, which transform
under the same SL(2,Z). The resulting superalgebra encodes the non-perturbative
duality properties of the theory and is valid for any value of the string
coupling constant. The usefulness of the formalism is illustrated by applying
it to purely algebraic computations of the tension of (p,q) strings, and the
mass and entropy of extremal blackholes constructed from D-1-branes and
D-5-branes. In the latter case the non-perturbative coupling dependence of the
BPS mass and metric is computed for the first time in this paper. It is further
argued that the moduli dependence of the superalgebra provides hints for four
more dimensions beyond ten, such that the superalgebra is embedded in a
fundamental theory which would be covariant under SO(11,3). An outline is given
for a matrix theory in 14 dimensions that would be consistent with M(atrix)
theory as well as with the above observations.
