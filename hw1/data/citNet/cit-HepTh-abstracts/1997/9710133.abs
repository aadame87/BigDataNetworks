  The technique of functional integration over velocities is applied to the
calculation of the propagator of a spinning particle with and without anomalous
magnetic moment. A representation for the spin factor is obtained in this
context for the particle in a constant electromagnetic field. As a by-product,
we also obtain a Schwinger representation for the first case.
