  We propose a method for the numerical computation of microcanonical
expectation values--i.e. averages over energy eigenstates with the same
eigenvalue-without any prior knowledge about the spectrum of the Hamiltonian.
This is accomplished by first defining a new Gaussian ensemble to approximate
the microcanonical one. We then develop a ``lattice theory'' for this Gaussian
ensemble and propose a Monte Carlo integration of the expectation values of the
lattice theory.
