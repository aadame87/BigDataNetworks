  Additional evidence is presented for a recently proposed effective string
model, conjectured to hold throughout the parameter space of the basic 5
dimensional, triply charged black holes, which includes the effects of brane
excitations, as well as momentum modes. We compute the low energy spacetime
absorption coefficient $\sigma$ for the scattering of a triply-charged scalar
field in the near extremal case, and conjecture an exact form for $\sigma$. It
is shown that this form of $\sigma$ arises simply from the effective string
model. This agreement encompasses both statistical factors coming from the Bose
distributions of string excitations and a prefactor which depends on the
effective string radius. An interesting feature of the effective string model
is that the change in mass of the effective string system in an emission
process is not equal to the change in the energies of the effective string
excitations. If the model is valid, this may hold clues towards understanding
back reaction due to Hawking radiation. A number of weak spots and open
questions regarding the model are also noted.
