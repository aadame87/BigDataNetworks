  We calculate an effective action and measure induced by the integration over
the auxiliary field in the matrix model recently proposed to describe IIB
superstrings. It is shown that the measure of integration over the auxiliary
matrix is uniquely determined by locality and reparametrization invariance of
the resulting effective action. The large--$N$ limit of the induced measure for
string coordinates is discussed in detail. It is found to be ultralocal and,
thus, possibly is irrelevant in the continuum limit. The model of the GKM type
is considered in relation to the effective action problem.
