  We examine the system where a string stretches between pair of D-branes, and
study the bending of the D-brane caused by the tension of the string. If the
distance between the pair of D-branes is sent to infinity, the tension of the
string stretching between them is strong enough to pull the spike all the way
to infinity. We study the shape of these spikes when the branes are finite
distance apart using two different methods. First, we consider a string
stretched between a pair of D2-branes in type IIA theory by going to the
M-theory limit in which all of these branes are M-theory 2-branes embedded
along a holomorphic curve. Second, we consider a D-string stretched between a
pair of D3-branes in type IIB theory and infer the geometry of the D3-brane
embeddings from the configuration of the adjoint scalar field in the magnetic
monopole solution of Prasad and Sommerfield. The case of fundamental string
stretching between a pair of D3-branes follows from S-duality. The energy of
these configurations matches the expected value based on fundamental string and
D-string tensions.
