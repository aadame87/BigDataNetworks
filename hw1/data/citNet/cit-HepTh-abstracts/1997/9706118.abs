  The identities satisfied by two-dimensional chiral quantum fields are studied
from the point of view of vertex algebras. The Cauchy-Jacobi identity (or the
Borcherds identity) for three mutually local fields is proved and consequently
a direct proof of Li's theorem on a local system of vertex operators is
provided. Several characterizations of vertex algebras are also discussed.
