  Recently we proposed a new Wick rotation for Dirac spinors which resulted in
a hermitean action in Euclidean space. Our work was in a path integral context,
however, in this note, we provide the canonical formulation of the new Wick
rotation along the lines of the proposal of Osterwalder and Schrader.
