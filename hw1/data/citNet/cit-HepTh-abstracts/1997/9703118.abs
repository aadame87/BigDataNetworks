  This is an introductory review on the eleven-dimensional description of the
BPS bound states of type II superstring theories, and on the role of
supermembranes in M-theory. The first part describes classical solutions of 11d
supergravity which upon dimensional reduction and T-dualities give bound states
of NS-NS and R-R p-branes of type IIA and IIB string theories. In some cases
(e.g. (q_1,q_2) string bound states of type IIB string theory), these
non-perturbative objects admit a simple eleven-dimensional description in terms
of a fundamental 2-brane. The BPS excitations of such 2-brane are calculated
and shown to exactly match the mass spectrum for the BPS (q_1,q_2) string bound
states. Different 11d representations of the same bound state can be used to
provide inequivalent (T-dual) descriptions of the oscillating BPS states. This
permits to test T-duality beyond perturbation theory and, in certain cases, to
evade membrane instabilities by going to a stable T-dual representation. We
finally summarize the results indicating in what regions of the modular
parameter space a supermembrane description for M-theory on R^9 x T^2 seems to
be adequate.
