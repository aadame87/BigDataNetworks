  By investigating the critical behavior appearing at the extremal limit of the
non-dilatonic, black p-branes in (d+p) dimensions, we find that some
critical exponents related to the critical point obey the scaling laws. From
the scaling laws we obtain that the effective spatial dimension of the
non-dilatonic black holes and black strings is one, and is p for the
non-dilatonic black p-branes. For the dilatonic black holes and black
p-branes, the effective dimension will depend on the parameters in theories.
Thus, we give an interpretation why the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy may be given
a simple world volume interpretation only for the non-dilatonic black
p-branes.
