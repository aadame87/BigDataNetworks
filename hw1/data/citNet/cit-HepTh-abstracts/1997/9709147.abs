  The semiclassical approximation for the partition function in Chern-Simons
gauge theory is derived using the invariant integration method. Volume and
scale factors which were undetermined and had to be fixed by hand in previous
derivations are automatically taken account of in this framework. Agreement
with Witten's exact expressions for the partition function in the weak coupling
(large k) limit is verified for gauge group SU(2) and spacetimes S^3, S^2 x
S^1, S^1 x S^1 x S^1 and L(p,q).
