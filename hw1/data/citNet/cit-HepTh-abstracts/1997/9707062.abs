  We propose a general mechanism for stabilizing the dilaton against runaway to
weak coupling. The method is based on features of the effective superpotential
which arise for supersymmetric gauge theories which are not asymptotically
free. Consideration of the 2PI effective action for bilinear operators of
matter and gauge superfields allows one to overcome the obstacles to
constructing a nonvanishing superpotential.
