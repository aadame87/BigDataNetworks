  We consider N=2 SUSY QCD with gauge group SU(2) and N_f flavours of
matter with nonzero mass. Using the method of the instanton-induced effective
vertex we calculate higher derivative corrections to the Seiberg-Witten result
in the momentum expansion of the low energy effective Lagrangian in various
regions of the modular space. Then we focus on a certain higher derivative
operator on the Higgs branch. We show that the singular behavior of this
operator comes from values of mass of matter at which charge singularity on the
Coulomb branch collides with the monopole or dyon one. Given the behavior of
this operator at weak coupling coming from instantons as well as its behavior
near points of colliding singularities we find the exact solution for this
operator.
