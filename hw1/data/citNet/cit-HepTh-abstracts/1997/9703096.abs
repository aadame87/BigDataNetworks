  We show the quantum equivalence between certain symmetric space sine-Gordon
models and the massive free fermions. In the massless limit, these fermions
reduce to the free fermions introduced by Goddard, Nahm and Olive (GNO) in
association with symmetric spaces $K/G$. A path integral formulation is given
in terms of the Wess-Zumino-Witten action where the field variable $g$ takes
value in the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic representations of the group
$G$ in the basis of the symmetric space. We show that, for example, such a path
integral bosonization is possible when the symmetric spaces $K/G$ are $SU(N)
\times SU(N)/SU(N); N \le 3, ~ Sp(2)/U(2)$ or $SO(8)/U(4)$. We also address
the relation between massive GNO fermions and the nonabelian solitons, and
explain the restriction imposed on the fermion mass matrix due to the
integrability of the bosonic model.
