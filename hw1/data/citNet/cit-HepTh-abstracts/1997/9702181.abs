  We propose a generalization of meanders, i.e., configurations of
non-selfintersecting loops crossing a line through a given number of points, to
SU(N). This uses the reformulation of meanders as pairs of reduced elements of
the Temperley-Lieb algebra, a SU(2)-related quotient of the Hecke algebra, with
a natural generalization to SU(N). We also derive explicit formulas for SU(N)
meander determinants, defined as the Gram determinants of the corresponding
bases of the Hecke algebra.
