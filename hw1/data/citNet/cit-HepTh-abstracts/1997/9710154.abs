  A geometric formulation of the Moyal deformation for the Self-dual Yang-Mills
theory and the Chiral Model approach to Self-dual gravity is given. We find in
Fedosov's geometrical construction of deformation quantization the natural
geometrical framework associated to the Moyal deformation of Self-dual gravity.
