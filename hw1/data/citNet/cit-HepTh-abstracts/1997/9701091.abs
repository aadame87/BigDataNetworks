  A universality of deformed Heisenberg algebra involving the reflection
operator is revealed. It is shown that in addition to the well-known
infinite-dimensional representations related to parabosons, the algebra has
also finite-dimensional representations of the parafermionic nature. We
demonstrate that finite-dimensional representations are representations of
deformed parafermionic algebra with internal Z_2-grading structure. On the
other hand, any finite- or infinite-dimensional representation of the algebra
supply us with irreducible representation of osp(1|2) superalgebra. We show
that the normalized form of deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection has the
structure of guon algebra related to the generalized statistics.
