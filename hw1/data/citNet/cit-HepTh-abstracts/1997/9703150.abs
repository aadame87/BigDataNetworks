  An inhomogeneous version of pre--Big Bang cosmology emerges, within string
theory, from quite generic initial conditions, provided they lie deeply inside
the weak-coupling, low-curvature regime. Large-scale homogeneity, flatness, and
isotropy appear naturally as late-time outcomes of such an evolution.
