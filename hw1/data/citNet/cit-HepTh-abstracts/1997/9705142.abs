  It is shown that the problem of calculating form factors in ADE affine Toda
field theories can be reduced to the nonperturbative recursive calculation of
polynomials symmetric in each sort of variables. We determine these recursion
equations explicitly for the ADE series and characterize the polynomial
solutions by an interplay between the weight space of the underlying Lie
algebra and representations of the symmetric group.
