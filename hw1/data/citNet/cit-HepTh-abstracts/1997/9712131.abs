Title: Quantum Field Theory on Fock Projective Space
Authors: Peter Leifer
Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX
\\
  It is shown that some analog of the ``second quantization'' exists in the
framework of CP(N) theory. I analyse conditions under that ``geometrical
bosons'' may be identified with real physical fields. The compact character of
a state manifold should preserve the quantities of dynamical variables from
divergences.
