Title: Introduction to Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
Authors: Olivier Piguet
Comments: 33 pages, latex, no figures

\\
  In these lectures I present a basic introduction to supersymmetry, especially
to N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories and their renormalization, in the
Wess-Zumino gauge. I also discuss the various ways supersymmetry may be broken
in order to account for the lack of exact supersymmetry in the actual world of
elementary particles.
