  We review progress in studying the solutions of SQCD in the presence of
explicit, soft SUSY breaking terms. Massive N=1 SQCD in the presence of a small
gaugino mass leads to a controlled solution which has interesting phase
structure with changing theta angle reminiscent of the QCD chiral Lagrangian.
Current attempts to test the solutions of pure glue SQCD on the lattice require
a theoretical understanding of the theory with small gaugino mass in order to
understand the approach to the SUSY point. We provide such a description making
predictions for the gaugino condensate and lightest bound state masses. Finally
we briefly review recent D-brane constructions of 4D gauge theories in string
theory including a non-supersymmetric configuration. We identify this
configuration with softly broken N=2 SQCD.
