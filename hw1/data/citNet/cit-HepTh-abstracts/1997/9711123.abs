  A non-relativistic version of the 2+1 dimensional gauged Chern-Simons O(3)
sigma model, augmented by a Maxwell term, is presented and shown to support
topologically stable static self-dual vortices. Exactly like their counterparts
of the ungauged model, these vortices are shown to exhibit Hall behaviour in
their dynamics.
