  QCD is constructed as a lattice gauge theory in which the elements of the
link matrices are represented by non-commuting operators acting in a Hilbert
space. The resulting quantum link model for QCD is formulated with a fifth
Euclidean dimension, whose extent resembles the inverse gauge coupling of the
resulting four-dimensional theory after dimensional reduction. The inclusion of
quarks is natural in Shamir's variant of Kaplan's fermion method, which does
not require fine-tuning to approach the chiral limit. A rishon representation
in terms of fermionic constituents of the gluons is derived and the quantum
link Hamiltonian for QCD with a U(N) gauge symmetry is expressed in terms of
glueball, meson and constituent quark operators. The new formulation of QCD is
promising both from an analytic and from a computational point of view.
