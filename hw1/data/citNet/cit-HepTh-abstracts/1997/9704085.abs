  In the framework of the generalized Hamiltonian formalism by Dirac, the local
symmetries of dynamical systems with first- and second-class constraints are
investigated. For theories with an algebra of constraints of special form (to
which a majority of the physically interesting theories belongs) the method of
constructing the generator of local-symmetry transformations is obtained from
the requirement of the quasi-invariance of an action. It is proved that
second-class constraints do not contribute to the transformation law of the
local symmetry which entirely is stipulated by all the first-class constraints.
It is thereby shown that degeneracy of special form theories with the first-
and second-class constraints is due to their quasi-invariance under
local-symmetry transformations.
