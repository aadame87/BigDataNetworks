  The zero-signature Killing metric of a new, real-valued, 8-dimensional
gauging of the conformal group accounts for the complex character of quantum
mechanics. The new gauge theory gives manifolds which generalize curved,
relativistic phase space. The difference in signature between the usual
momentum space metric and the Killing metric of the new geometry gives rise to
an imaginary proportionality constant connecting the momentumlike variables of
the two spaces. Path integral quantization becomes an average over dilation
factors, with the integral of the Weyl vector taking the role of the action.
Minimal U(1) electromagnetic coupling is predicted.
