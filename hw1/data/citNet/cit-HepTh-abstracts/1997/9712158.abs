  We show that the spontaneous compactification of the Abelian and non-Abelian
two-form gauge field theories from $D=4+1$ to $D=3+1$ leads to the same
theories plus the Maxwell and Yang-Mills ones, respectively. The vector
potential comes from the zero mode of the fifth component of the tensor gauge
field in D=5. Concerning to the non-Abelian case, it is necessary to make a
more refined definition of the three-form stress tensor in order to be
compatible, after the compactification, with the two-form stress tensor of the
Yang-Mills theory.
