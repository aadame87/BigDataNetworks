  We present a nonperturbative field theoretic method based on the
Liouville-Neumann (LN) equation. The LN approach provides a unified formulation
of nonperturbative quantum fields and also nonequilibrium quantum fields, which
makes use of mean-field type equations and whose results at the lowest level
are identically the same as those of the Gaussian effective potential approach
and the mean-field approach. The great advantageous point of this formulation
is its readiness of applicability to time-dependent quantum systems and to
finite temperature field theory, and its possibility to go beyond the Gaussian
approximation.
