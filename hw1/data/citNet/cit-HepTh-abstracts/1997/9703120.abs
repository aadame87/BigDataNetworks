  We revisit the treatment of the multiflavor massive Schwinger model by
non-Abelian Bosonization. We compare three different approximations to the
low-lying spectrum: i) reading it off from the bosonized Lagrangian (neglecting
interactions), ii) semi-classical quantization of the static soliton, iii)
approximate semi-classical quantization of the ``breather'' solitons. A number
of new points are made in this process. We also suggest a different ``effective
low-energy Lagrangian'' for the theory which permits easy calculation of the
low-energy scattering amplitudes. It correlates an exact mass formula of the
system with the requirement of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.
