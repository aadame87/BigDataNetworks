  We study the Euler numbers and the entropies of the non-extremal intersecting
D-branes in ten-dimensions. We use the surface gravity to constrain the
compactification radii. We correctly obtain the integer valued Euler numbers
for these radii. Moreover, the entropies are found to be invariant under the
T-duality transformation. In the extremal limit, we obtain the finite entropies
only for two intersecting D-branes. We observe that these entropies are
proportional to the product of the charges of each D-brane. We further study
the entropies of the boosted metrics. We find that their entropies can be
interpreted in term of the microscopic states of D-branes.
