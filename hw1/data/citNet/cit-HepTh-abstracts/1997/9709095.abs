  We consider QED - processes in the presence of an infinitely thin and
infinitely long straight string with a magnetic flux inside it. The
bremsstrahlung from an electron passing by the magnetic string and the
electron-positron pair production by a single photon are reviewed. Based on the
exact electron and positron solutions of the Dirac equation in the external
Aharonov-Bohm potential we present matrix elements for these processes. The
dependence of the resulting cross sections on energies, directions and
polarizations of the involved particles is discussed for low energies.
