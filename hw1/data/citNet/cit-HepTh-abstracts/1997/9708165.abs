  The reduced O(3)-sigma model with an O(3)->O(2) symmetry breaking potential
is considered with an additional Skyrmionic term, i.e. a totally antisymmetric
quartic term in the field derivatives. This Skyrme term does not affect the
classical static equations of motionwhich, however, allow an unstable sphaleron
solution. Quantum fluctuations around the static classical solution are
considered for the determination of the rate of thermally induced transitions
between topologically distinct vacua mediated by the sphaleron. The main
technical effect of the Skyrme term is to produce an extra measure factor in
one of the fluctuation path integrals which is therefore evaluated using a
measure-modified Fourier-Matsubara decomposition (this being one of the few
cases permitting this explicit calculation). The resulting transition rate is
valid in a temperature region different from that of the original Skyrme-less
model, and the crossover from transitions dominated by thermal fluctuations to
those dominated by tunneling at the lower limit of this range depends on the
strength of the Skyrme coupling.
