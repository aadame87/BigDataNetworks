  In this paper we consider the class of exact solutions of the Schrodinger
equation with the Razavi potential. By means of this we obtain some
wavefunctions and mass spectra of the relativistic scalar field model with
spontaneously broken symmetry near the static kink solution. Appearance of the
bosons, which have two different spins, will be shown in the theory, thereby
the additional breaking of discrete symmetry between the quantum mechanical
kink particles with the opposite spins (i.e. the T-violation) takes place.
