Title: The Role of Renormalization Group in Fundamental Theoretical Physics
Authors: Dmitri V. Shirkov
Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX The text of the talk presented at the Conference
  "RG-96" (Dubna, Aug.'96). To appear at the proceedings
Journal-ref: Int.J.Mod.Phys. B12 (1998) 1247-1253

  General aspects of fundamental physics are considered. We comment the
Wigner's logical scheme and modify it to adjust to modern theoretical physics.
Then, we discuss the role and indicate the place of renormalization group in
the logic of fundamental physics.
