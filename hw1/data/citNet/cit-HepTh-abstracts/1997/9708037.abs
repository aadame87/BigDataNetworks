  We discuss M(atrix) theory compactification on T^6. This theory is described
by the large N limit of the world volume theory, of N Kaluza-Klein monopoles in
eleven dimensions. We discuss the BPS states, and their arrangement in E_6
multiplets. We then propose the formulation of the world volume theory of KK
monopoles in eleven dimensions that decouples from the bulk. This is given by a
large N_1 m(atrix) theory with eight supercharges, corresponding to the quantum
mechanics theory of N_1 zero-branes inside the Type IIA Kaluza-Klein monopole.
Various limits of the construction are considered.
