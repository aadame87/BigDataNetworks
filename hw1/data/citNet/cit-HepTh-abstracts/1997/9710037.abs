  The transformation properties of the N=2 Virasoro superalgebra generators
under Poisson-Lie T-duality in (2,2)-superconformal WZNW and Kazama-Suzuki
models is considered. It is shown that Poisson-Lie T-duality acts on the N=2
super-Virasoro algebra generators as a mirror symmetry does: it unchanges the
generators from one of the chirality sectors while in another chirality sector
it changes the sign of U(1) current and interchanges spin-3/2 currents. We
discuss Kazama-Suzuki models generalization of this transformation and show
that Poisson-Lie T-duality acts as a mirror symmetry also.
