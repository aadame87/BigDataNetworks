  We study the low-energy behavior of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with
product gauge groups SU(N)^M and M chiral superfields transforming in the
fundamental representation of two of the SU(N) factors. These theories are in
the Coulomb phase with an unbroken U(1)^(N-1) gauge group. For N >= 3, M >= 3
the theories are chiral. The low-energy gauge kinetic functions can be obtained
from hyperelliptic curves which we derive by considering various limits of the
theories. We present several consistency checks of the curves including
confinement through the addition of mass perturbations and other limits.
