  We consider a (2+1) dimensional nonlinear O(3) sigma model with its U(1)
subgroup gauged along with the inclusion of a self-interaction having symmetry
breaking minima.The gauge field dynamics is governed by the Maxwell term.The
model is shown to support topologically stable purely magnetic self-dual
vortices.
