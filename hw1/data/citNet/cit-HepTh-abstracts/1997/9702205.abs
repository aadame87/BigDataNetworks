  We found BPS-saturated solutions of M-theory and Type II string theory which
correspond to (non-marginally) bound states of p-branes intersecting at angles
different from pi/2. These solutions are obtained by starting with a BPS
marginally bound (orthogonally) intersecting configurations of two p-branes
(e.g, two four-branes of Type II string theory), performing a boost
transformation at an angle with respect to the world-volume of the
configuration, performing T-duality transformation along the boost-direction,
S-duality transformation, and T- transformations along the direction
perpendicular to the boost transformation. The resulting configuration is
non-marginally bound BPS-saturated solution whose static metric possesses the
off-diagonal term which cannot be removed by a coordinate transformation, and
thus signifies an angle (different from pi/2) between the resulting
intersecting p-branes. Additional new p-branes are bound to this configuration,
in order to ensure the stability of such a static, tilted configuration.
