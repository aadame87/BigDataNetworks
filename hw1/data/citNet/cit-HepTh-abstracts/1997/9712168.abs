  We study the new ``gauge'' theories in 5+1 dimensions, and their
non-commutative generalizations. We argue that the $\theta$-term and the
non-commutative torus parameters appear on an equal footing in the non-critical
string theories which define the gauge theories. The use of these theories as a
Matrix description of M-theory on $T^5$, as well as a closely related
realization as 5-branes in type IIB string theory, proves useful in studying
some of their properties.
