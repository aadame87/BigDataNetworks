  The 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions are a standard tool to study and
test non-perturbative issues in quantum field theory. We give a new, simple
proof of the anomaly matching conditions in 2D Poincare` invariant theories. We
consider the case of invariance under a large class of generalized symmetries,
which include abelian and non-abelian internal symmetries, space-time
symmetries generated by the stress tensor, and W-type of symmetries generated
by higher spin currents.
