  Extending recent work on SU gauge theory, we engineer local string models
for N=1 four-dimensional SO and USp gauge theories coupled to matter in
the fundamental. The local models are type IIB orientifolds with D7 branes on a
curved orientifold 7-plane, and matter realized by adding D3 branes on the
orientifold plane. The Higgs branches of the SO and USp theories can be
matched with the moduli spaces of SO and USp instantons on the compact
four-dimensional part of the D7 branes worldvolume. The R-charge of the gauge
theories is identified with a U(1) symmetry on the worldvolume of an
Euclidean D3 brane instanton. We argue that the quantum field theory dualities
of these gauge theories arise from T-dualities of type IIB strings exchanging
D7 and D3 charges. A crucial role is played by the induced D3 charge of D7
branes and an orientifold 7-plane, both partially compactified on a $Z_2$
orbifold of K3.
