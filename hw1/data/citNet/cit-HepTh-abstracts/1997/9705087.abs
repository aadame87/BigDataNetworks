  We carry out the Hamiltonian analysis of non-Abelian gauge theories in (2+1)
dimensions in a gauge-invariant matrix parametrization of the fields. A
detailed discussion of regularization issues and the construction of the
renormalized Laplace operator on the configuration space, which is proportional
to the kinetic energy, are given. The origin of the mass gap is analyzed and
the lowest eigenstates of the kinetic energy are explicitly obtained; these
have zero charge and exhibit a mass gap . The nature of the corrections due to
the potential energy, the possibility of an improved perturbation theory and a
Schrodinger-like equation for the states are also discussed.
