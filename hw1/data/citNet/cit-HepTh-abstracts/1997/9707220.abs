  I show that the spin-statistics theorem has been confused with another
theorem that I call the spin-locality theorem. I also argue that the
spin-statistics theorem properly depends on the properties of asymptotic fields
which are free fields. In addition, I discuss how ghosts evade both theorems,
give the basis of the spin-statistics theorem for fields without asymptotic
limits such as quark and gluon fields, and emphasise the weakness of the
requirements for the $TCP$ theorem.
