  The Lie algebraic structures of the S-matrices for the affine Toda field
theories based on the dual pairs (X_N^{(1)}, Y_M^{(l)}) are discussed. For the
non-simply-laced horizontal subalgebra X_N and the simply-laced horizontal
subalgebra Y_M, we introduce a ``q-deformation'' of a Coxeter element and a
``p-deformation'' of a twisted Coxeter element respectively. Using these
deformed objects, expressions for the generating function of the multiplicities
of the building block of the S-matrices are obtained. The relation between the
deformed version of Dorey's rule and generalized Dorey's rule due to Chari and
Pressley are discussed.
