Comments: 27 pages, latex with espcrc2, 3 figures. References added. Some
  corrections at the end of section 10. Based on lectures given by H.V. 
  at the APCTP Winter School held in Sokcho, Korea (Feb 1997) and joint
  lectures at Cargese Summer School (June 1997), as well as on talks given by
  H.V. at SUSY'97 (May 1997), and by R.D. and E.V. at STRINGS'97 (June 1997)

  We review some recent developments in the study of M-theory compactifications
via Matrix theory. In particular we highlight the appearance of IIA strings and
their interactions, and explain the unifying role of the M-theory five-brane
for describing the spectrum of the T^5 compactification and its duality
symmetries. The 5+1-dimensional micro-string theory that lives on the fivebrane
world-volume takes a central place in this presentation.
