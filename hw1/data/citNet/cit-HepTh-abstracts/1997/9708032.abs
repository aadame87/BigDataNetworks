  A recently proposed renormalization scheme can be used to deal with
nonrelativistic potential scattering exhibiting ultraviolet divergence in
momentum space. A numerical application of this scheme is made in the case of
potential scattering with $r^{-2}$ divergence for small r, common in molecular
and nuclear physics, by the use of cut-offs in momentum and configuration
spaces. The cut-off is finally removed in terms of a physical observable and
model-independent result is obtained at low energies. The expected variation of
the off-shell behavior of the t matrix arising from the renormalization scheme
is also discussed.
