  Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary. We study the
vacuum expectation value of an operator Q by studying Tr Qe^{-tD}, where D is
an operator of Laplace type on M, and where Q is a second order operator with
scalar leading symbol; we impose Dirichlet or modified Neumann boundary
conditions.
