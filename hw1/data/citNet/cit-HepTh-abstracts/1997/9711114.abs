  The partition function of type IIA and B strings on R^6xK3, in the T^4/Z_2
orbifold limit, is explicitly computed as a modular invariant sum over spin
strutures required by perturbative unitarity in order to extend the analysis to
include type II strings on R^6 x W4, where W4 is associated with the tube
metric conformal field theory, given by the degrees of freedom transverse to
the Neveu-Schwarz fivebrane solution. This generates partition functions and
perturbative spectra of string theories in six space-time dimensions,
associated with the modular invariants of the level k affine SU(2) Kac-Moody
algebra. These theories provide a conformal field theory (i.e. perturbative)
probe of non-perturbative (fivebrane) vacua. We contrast them with theories
whose N=(4,4) sigma-model action contains n_H=k+2 hypermultiplets as well as
vector supermultiplets, and where k is the level just mentioned. In Appendix B
we also give a D=6, N=(1,1) `free fermion' string model which has a different
moduli space of vacua from the 81 parameter space relevant to the above
examples.
