  The motivation and the challenge in applying the renormalization group for
systems with several scaling regimes is briefly outlined. The four dimensional
$\phi^4$ model serves as an example where a nontrivial low energy scaling
regime is identified in the vicinity of the spinodal instability region. It is
pointed out that the effective theory defined in the vicinity of the spinodal
instability offers an amplification mechanism, a precursor of the condensation
that can be used to explore nonuniversal forces at high energies.
