  A few generalizations of a Poisson algebra to field theory canonically
formulated in terms of the polymomentum variables are discussed. A graded
Poisson bracket on differential forms and an $(n+1)$-ary bracket on functions
are considered. The Poisson bracket on differential forms gives rise to various
generalizations of a Gerstenhaber algebra: the noncommutative (in the sense of
Loday) and the higher-order (in the sense of the higher order graded Leibniz
rule). The $(n+1)$-ary bracket fulfills the properties of the Nambu bracket
including the ``fundamental identity'', thus leading to the Nambu-Poisson
algebra. We point out that in the field theory context the Nambu bracket with a
properly defined covariant analogue of Hamilton's function determines a joint
evolution of several dynamical variables.
