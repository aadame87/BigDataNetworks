  We construct brane configurations leading to chiral four dimensional N=1
supersymmetric gauge theories. The brane realizations consist of intersecting
Neveu-Schwarz five-branes and Dirichlet four-branes in non-flat spacetime
backgrounds. We discuss in some detail the construction in a C^2/Z_M orbifold
background. The infrared theory on the four-brane worldvolume is a four
dimensional N=1 SU(N)^M gauge theory with chiral matter representations. We
discuss various consistency checks and show that the spectral curves describing
the Coulomb phase of the theory can be obtained once the orbifold brane
construction is embedded in M-theory. We also discuss the addition of extra
vectorlike matter and other interesting generalizations.
