  The recently proposed ``correspondence principle'' of Horowitz and Polchinski
provides a concrete means to relate (among others) black holes with electric
NS-NS charges to fundamental strings and correctly match their entropies. We
test further this correspondence by examining the greybody factors in the
absorption rates of neutral, minimally coupled scalars by a near extremal black
hole. Perhaps surprisingly, the results disagree in general with the absorption
by weakly coupled strings. Though this does not disprove the correspondence, it
indicates that it might not be simple in this region of the black hole
parameter space.
