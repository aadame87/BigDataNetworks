  We study the evolution of non-linear spherically symmetric inhomogeneities in
string cosmology. Friedmann solutions of different spatial curvature are
matched to produce solutions which describe the evolution of non-linear density
and curvature inhomogeneities. The evolution of bound and unbound
inhomogeneities are studied. The problem of primordial black hole formation is
discussed in the string cosmological context and the pattern of evolution is
determined in the pre- and post-big-bang phases of evolution.
