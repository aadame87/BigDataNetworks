Title: On the convergence of the usual perturbative expansions
Authors: G.M. Cicuta
Comments: 11 pages, Latex (1 EPS figure included)
\\
  The study of the convergence of power series expansions of energy eigenvalues
for anharmonic oscillators in quantum mechanics differs from general
understanding, in the case of quasi-exactly solvable potentials. They provide
examples of expansions with finite radius and suggest techniques useful to
analyze more generic potentials.
