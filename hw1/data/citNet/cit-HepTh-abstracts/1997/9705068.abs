  We derive four dimensional gauge theories with exceptional groups $F_4$,
$E_8$, $E_7$, and $E_7$ with matter, by starting from the duality between the
heterotic string on $K3$ and F-theory on a elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau
3-fold. This configuration is compactified to four dimensions on a torus, and
by employing toric geometry, we compute the type IIB mirrors of the Calabi-Yaus
of the type IIA string theory. We identify the Seiberg-Witten curves describing
the gauge theories as ALE spaces fibered over a $P^1$ base.
