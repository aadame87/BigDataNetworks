  The screening nature of the potential between external quarks in massless
$SU(N_c)$ $QCD_2$ is derived using an expansion in $N_f$- the number of
flavors. Applying the same method to the massive model, we find a confining
potential. We consider the N=1 super Yang Mills theory, reveal certain
problematic aspects of its bosonized version and show the associated screening
behavior by applying a point splitting method to the scalar current.
