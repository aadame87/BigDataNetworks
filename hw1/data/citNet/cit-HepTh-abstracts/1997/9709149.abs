  It is shown that purely bosonic field theories can have configurations with
half-integral angular momentum even when the topological magnetic charge of the
configuration vanishes. This result is applicable whenever there is a
non-Abelian gauge theory with particles that transform in the fundamental
representation of the non-Abelian symmetry group.
