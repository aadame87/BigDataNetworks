  The one-loop effective potential for gauge models in static de Sitter space
at finite temperatures is computed by means of the $\zeta$--function method. We
found a simple relation which links the effective potentials of gauge and
scalar fields at all temperatures.
  In the de Sitter invariant and zero-temperature states the potential for
the scalar electrodynamics is explicitly obtained, and its properties in
these two vacua are compared. In this theory the two states are shown to
behave similarly in the regimes of very large and very small radii a of the
background space. For the gauge symmetry broken in the flat limit ($a \to
\infty$) there is a critical value of a for which the symmetry is restored in
both quantum states. Moreover, the phase transitions which occur at large or
at small a are of the first or of the second order, respectively, regardless
the vacuum considered. The analytical and numerical analysis of the critical
parameters of the above theory is performed. We also established a class of
models for which the kind of phase transition occurring depends on the choice
of the vacuum.
