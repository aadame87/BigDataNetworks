  We investigate how the gap equations are obtained in the light-front
formalism within the four-Fermi theories. Instead of the zero-mode constraint,
we find that the "fermionic constraints" on nondynamical spinor components are
responsible for symmetry breaking. Careful treatment of the infrared divergence
is indispensable for obtaining the gap equation.
