  Configurations of two or more branes wrapping different homology cycles of
space-time are considered and the amount of supersymmetry preserved is
analysed, generalising the analysis of multiple branes in flat space. For K3
compactifications, these give the Type II or M theory origin of certain
supersymmetric four-dimensional heterotic string solutions that fit into
spin-3/2 multiplets and which become massless at certain points in moduli
space. The interpretation of these BPS states and the possibility of
supersymmetry enhancement are discussed.
