  The Hamiltonian structure of spin generalization of the rational
Ruijsenaars-Schneider model is found by using the Hamiltonian reduction
technique. It is shown that the model possesses the current algebra symmetry.
The possibility of generalizing the found Poisson structure to the
trigonometric case is discussed and degeneration to the Euler-Calogero-Moser
system is examined.
