  Expanding upon earlier work of Pouliot and Strassler, we construct chiral
magnetic duals to nonchiral supersymmetric electric theories based upon SO(7),
SO(8) and SO(9) gauge groups with various numbers of vector and spinor matter
superfields. Anomalies are matched and gauge invariant operators are mapped
within each dual pair. Renormalization group flows along flat directions are
also examined. We find that confining phase quantum constraints in the electric
theories are recovered from semiclassical equations of motion in their magnetic
counterparts when the dual gauge groups are completely Higgsed.
