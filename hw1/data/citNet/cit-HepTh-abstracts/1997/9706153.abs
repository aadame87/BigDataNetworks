  We present a systematic analysis of possible bound states of M-brane
solutions (including waves and monopoles) by using the solution generating
technique of reduction of M-brane to 10 dimensions, use of T-duality and then
lifting back to 11 dimensions. We summarize a list of bound states for one- and
two-charge cases including tilted brane solutions. Construction rules for these
non-marginal solutions are also discussed.
