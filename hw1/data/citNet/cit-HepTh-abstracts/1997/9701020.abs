  We investigate the confining phase vacuum structure of supersymmetric SO(11)
gauge theories with one spinor matter field and Nf \le 6 vectors. We describe
several useful tricks and tools that facilitate the analysis of these chiral
models and many other theories of similar type. The forms of the Nf=5 and Nf=6
quantum moduli spaces are deduced by requiring that they reproduce known
results for SU(5) SUSY QCD along the spinor flat direction. After adding mass
terms for vector fields and integrating out heavy degrees of freedom, we also
determine the dynamically generated superpotentials in the Nf \le 4 quantum
theories. We close with some remarks regarding magnetic duals to the Nf \ge 7
electric SO(11) theories.
