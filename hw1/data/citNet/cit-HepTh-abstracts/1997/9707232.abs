  This is a summary of the work in the author's recent paper with this title
written with Jerome Gauntlett, George Papadopoulos and Paul Townsend,
hep-th/9702202. We showed how to construct hyper-K\"ahler 8-metrics in terms of
arrangements of three-dimensional hyperplanes in six-dimensional euclidean
space. The slopes of the planes define two relatively prime integers $(p,q)$.
Under reduction to ten dimensions and T-duality we get a geometric picture of
the action of $SL(2,Z)$ on the $(NS \otimes NS,q R \otimes R)$ 5-branes of
type IIB string theory. Configurations are exhibited with $3 \over 16$'th SUSY.
