Title: Duality and Topological Quantum Field Theory
Authors: J. M. F. Labastida and M. Marino
Comments: 18 pages, latex. Invited talk at the 'Workshop on Frontiers of Field
  Theory, Quantum Gravity and String Theory' held at Puri, India, on December
  12-21, 1996

  We present a summary of the applications of duality to Donaldson-Witten
theory and its generalizations. Special emphasis is made on the computation of
Donaldson invariants in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants using recent results
in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory. A brief account on the invariants obtained
in the theory of non-abelian monopoles is also presented.
