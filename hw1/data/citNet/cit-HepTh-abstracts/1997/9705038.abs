  The possible tensor constructions of open string theories are analyzed from
first principles. To this end the algebraic framework of open string field
theory is clarified, including the role of the homotopy associative A_\infty
algebra, the odd symplectic structure, cyclicity, star conjugation, and twist.
It is also shown that two string theories are off-shell equivalent if the
corresponding homotopy associative algebras are homotopy equivalent in a strict
sense.
  It is demonstrated that a homotopy associative star algebra with a compatible
even bilinear form can be attached to an open string theory. If this algebra
does not have a spacetime interpretation, positivity and the existence of a
conserved ghost number require that its cohomology is at degree zero, and that
it has the structure of a direct sum of full matrix algebras. The resulting
string theory is shown to be physically equivalent to a string theory with a
familiar open string gauge group.
