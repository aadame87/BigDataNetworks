  After summarizing the development of black hole thermodynamics in the
seventies, we describe a recent microscopic model. This model suggests that the
Bekenstein-Hawking area formula holds for extremal black holes as well as for
ordinary (non-extremal) ones. On the other hand, semiclassical studies have
suggested a discontinuity between non-extremal and extremal cases. We indicate
how a reconciliation has been brought about by summing over topologies.
