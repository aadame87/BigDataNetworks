  The statistical mechanics of black holes arbitrarily far from extremality is
modeled by a gas of weakly interacting strings. As an effective low energy
description of black holes the model provides a number of highly non-trivial
consistency checks and predictions. Speculations on a fundamental origin of the
model suggest surprising simplifications in non-perturbative string theory,
even in the absence of supersymmetry.
