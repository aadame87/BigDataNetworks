  We study the N -> 0 limit of the O(N) Gross-Neveu model in the framework of
the massless form-factor approach. This model is related to the continuum limit
of the Ising model with random bonds via the replica method. We discuss how
this method may be useful in calculating correlation functions of physical
operators. The identification of non-perturbative fixed points of the O(N)
Gross-Neveu model is pursued by its mapping to a WZW model.
