Title: On non-abelian generalisation of Born-Infeld action in string theory
Author: A.A. Tseytlin
Comments: 13 pages, harvmac. Some confusion about instanton matrix model
  solutions corrected (string solution is interpreted as a D-string bound to a
  large number of D-instantons)

  We show that the part of the tree-level open string effective action for the
non-abelian vector field which depends on the field strength but not on its
covariant derivatives, is given by the symmetrised trace of the direct
non-abelian generalisation of the Born-Infeld invariant. We discuss
applications to D-brane dynamics.
