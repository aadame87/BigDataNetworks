  We derive conjectures for the N=2 "chiral" determinant formulae of the
Topological algebra, the Antiperiodic NS algebra, and the Periodic R algebra,
corresponding to incomplete Verma modules built on chiral topological
primaries, chiral and antichiral NS primaries, and Ramond ground states,
respectively. Our method is based on the analysis of the singular vectors in
chiral Verma modules and their spectral flow symmetries, together with some
computer exploration and some consistency checks. In addition, and as a
consequence, we uncover the existence of subsingular vectors in these algebras,
giving examples (subsingular vectors are non-highest-weight null vectors which
are not descendants of any highest-weight singular vectors).
