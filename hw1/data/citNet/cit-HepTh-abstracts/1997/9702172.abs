  We investigate the quantization of two-dimensional version of the generalized
Chern-Simons actions which were proposed previously. The models turn out to be
infinitely reducible and thus we need infinite number of ghosts, antighosts and
the corresponding antifields. The quantized minimal actions which satisfy the
master equation of Batalin and Vilkovisky have the same Chern-Simons form. The
infinite fields and antifields are successfully controlled by the unified
treatment of generalized fields with quaternion algebra. This is a universal
feature of generalized Chern-Simons theory and thus the quantization procedure
can be naturally extended to arbitrary even dimensions.
