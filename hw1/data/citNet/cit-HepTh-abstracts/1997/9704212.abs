  In the DHR theory of superselection sectors, one usually considers states
which are local excitations of some vacuum state. Here, we extend this analysis
to local excitations of a class of "infravacuum" states appearing in models
with massless particles. We show that the corresponding superselection
structure, the statistics of superselection sectors and the energy-momentum
spectrum are the same as with respect to the vacuum state. (The latter result
is obtained with a novel method of expressing the shape of the spectrum in
terms of properties of local charge transfer cocycles.) These findings provide
evidence to the effect that infravacua are a natural starting point for the
analysis of the superselection structure in theories with long-range forces.
