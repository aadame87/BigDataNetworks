  More general constructions are given of six-dimensional theories that look at
low energy like six-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory. The constructions
start with either parallel fivebranes in Type IIB, or M-theory on
$(\C^2\times\S^1)/\Gamma$ for $\Gamma$ a suitable finite group. Via these
constructions, one can obtain six-dimensional theories with any simple gauge
group, and $SU(r)$ theories with any rational theta angle. A matrix
construction of these theories is also possible.
