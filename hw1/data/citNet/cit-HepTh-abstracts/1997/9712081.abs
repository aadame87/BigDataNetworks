  We study the Born-Infeld equation from a Lagrangian point of view emphasizing
the duality symmetry present in such systems. We obtain the Hamiltonian
formulation directly from the Lagrangian. We also show that this system admits
a dispersionless nonstandard Lax representation which directly leads to all the
conserved charges (including the ones not previously obtained). We also present
the generating function for these charges and point out various other
properties of this system.
