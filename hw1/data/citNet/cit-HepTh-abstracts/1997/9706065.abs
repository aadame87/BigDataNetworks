  Using standard coordinates, the Maxwell equations in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om
geometry are written in terms of a couple of scalar fields satisfying
Klein-Gordon like equations. The density of states is derived in the
semi-classical approximation and the first quantum corrections to the black
hole entropy is computed by using the brick-wall model.
