Author: Hirotaka Sugawara

\\
  F theory and M theory are formulated as gauge theories of area preserving
diffeomorphism algebra. Our M theory is shown to be 1-brane formulation rather
than 0-brane formulation of M theory of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind
and the F theory is shown to be 1-brane formulation rather than -1-brane
formulation of type IIB matrix theory of Ishibashi, Kawai, Kitazawa and
Tsuchiya.
