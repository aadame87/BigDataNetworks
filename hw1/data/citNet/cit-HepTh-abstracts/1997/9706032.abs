  We consider the low-energy effective field theory of heterotic string theory
compactified on a seven-torus, and we construct electrically charged as well as
more general solitonic solutions. These solutions preserve 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of
N=8, D=3 supersymmetry and have Killing spinors which exist due to cancellation
of holonomies. The associated space-time line elements do not exhibit the
conical structure that often arises in 2+1 dimensional gravity theories.
