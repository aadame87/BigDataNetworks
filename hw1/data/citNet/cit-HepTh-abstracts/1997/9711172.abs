  We propose an extension of a recent non-perturbative method suited for
solving the N-body problem in (2+1)-gravity to the case of Chern-Simons
supergravity. Coupling with supersymmetric point particles is obtained
implicitly by extending the DJH matching conditions of gravity. The consistent
solution of the interacting case is obtained by building a general non-trivial
mapping, extending the superanalytic mapping, between a flat polydromic $X^M$
supercoordinate system and a physical one $x^N$, representing the DJH matching
conditions around the superparticles. We show how to construct such a mapping
in terms of analytic functions, and we give their exact expressions for the two
body case. The extension to the N body case is also discussed. In the
Minkoskian coordinates the superparticles move freely, and in particular the
fermionic coordinates $\Theta(\xi^N_{(i)})$ are constants, whose values can be
fixed by using the monodromy properties. While the bosonic part of the
supergeodesic equations are obtained, as in gravity, by measuring the bosonic
distance in Minkowskian space-time, we find that the fermionic geodesic
equations can be defined only by requiring that a non-perturbative divergence
of the $X^M = X^M(x^N)$ mapping cancels out on the world-lines of the
superparticles.
