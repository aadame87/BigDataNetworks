  The semi-classical cross-sections for arbitrary partial waves of ordinary
scalars to fall into certain five-dimensional black holes have a form that
seems capable of explanation in terms of the effective string model. The
kinematics of these processes is analyzed in detail on the effective string and
is shown to reproduce the correct functional form of the semi-classical
cross-sections. But it is necessary to choose a peculiar value of the effective
string tension to obtain the correct scaling properties. Furthermore, the
assumptions of locality and statistics combine to forbid the effective string
from absorbing more than a finite number of partial waves. The relation of this
limitation to cosmic censorship is discussed.
