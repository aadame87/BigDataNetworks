  We derive the spectral representations of QED 3-point functions and then
explicitly calculate the 3-point spectral densities in hard thermal loop
approximation within the real time formalism. The Ward identities obeyed by the
retarded and advanced 2- and 3-point functions are discussed. We compare our
results with those for hot QCD .
