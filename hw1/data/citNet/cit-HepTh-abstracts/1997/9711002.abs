Title: String Theory and Quark Confinement
Author: A. Polyakov

  This article is based on a talk given at the ``Strings'97'' conference. It
discusses the search for the universality class of confining strings. The key
ingredients include the loop equations, the zigzag symmetry, the non-linear
renormalization group. Some new tests for the equivalence between gauge fields
and strings are proposed.
