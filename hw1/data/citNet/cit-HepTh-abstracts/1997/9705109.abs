  It is pointed out that affine Lie algebras appear to be the natural
mathematical structure underlying the notion of integrability for
two-dimensional systems. Their role in the construction and classification of
2D integrable systems is discussed. The super- symmetric case will be
particularly enphasized. The fundamental examples will be outlined.
