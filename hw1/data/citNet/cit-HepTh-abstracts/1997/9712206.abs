  We illustrate the various ways in which the algebraic framework of
noncommutative geometry naturally captures the short-distance spacetime
properties of string theory. We describe the noncommutative spacetime
constructed from a vertex operator algebra and show that its algebraic
properties bear a striking resemblence to some structures appearing in M
Theory, such as the noncommutative torus. We classify the inner automorphisms
of the space and show how they naturally imply the conventional duality
symmetries of the quantum geometry of spacetime. We examine the problem of
constructing a universal gauge group which overlies all of the dynamical
symmetries of the string spacetime. We also describe some aspects of toroidal
compactifications with a light-like coordinate and show how certain generalized
Kac-Moody symmetries, such as the Monster sporadic group, arise as gauge
symmetries of the resulting spacetime and of superstring theories.
