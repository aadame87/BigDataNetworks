  S-duality of hetertotic / type II string theory compactified on a six
dimensional torus requires the existence of Kaluza-Klein dyons, carrying
winding charge. We identify the zero modes of the Kaluza-Klein monopole
solution which are responsible for these dyonic excitations, and show that we
get the correct degeneracy of dyons as predicted by S-duality. The self-dual
harmonic two form on the Euclidean Taub-NUT space plays a crucial role in this
construction.
