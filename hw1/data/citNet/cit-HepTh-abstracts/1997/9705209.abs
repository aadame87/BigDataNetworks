  We investigate quantum aspects of the three dimensional (BTZ) black holes.
The discussions are devoted to two subjects: the thermodynamics of quantum
scalar fields and the string theory in the three dimensional black hole
backgrounds. We take two approaches to the thermodynamics. In one approach we
use mode expansion, and in the other we use Hartle-Hawking Green functions. We
obtain exact expressions of mode functions, Hartle-Hawking Green functions,
Green functions on a cone geometry, and thermodynamic quantities. The entropies
depend largely upon methods of calculation including regularization schemes and
boundary conditions. This indicates the importance of precise discussions on
the definition of the thermodynamic quantities for understanding black hole
entropy. Then we investigate the string theory in the framework of conformal
field theory. The model is described by an orbifold of the SL(2,R) WZW model.
We discuss the spectrum by solving the level matching condition and obtain
winding modes. We analyze the physical states and investigate the ghost
problem. Explicit examples of negative-norm physical states (ghosts) are found.
Thus we discuss possibilities for obtaining a sensible theory. The tachyon
propagation and the target-space geometry are also discussed. This is the first
attempt to quantize a string in a black hole background with an infinite number
of propagating modes. Although we cannot overcome all the problems, our results
may provide a useful basis for both subjects.
