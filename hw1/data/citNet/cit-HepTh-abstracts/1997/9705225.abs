  We study supermembranes in the light-cone gauge in eleven flat dimensions
with compact directions. The membrane states are subject to only the central
charges associated with closed two-branes, which, in this case, are generated
by the winding itself. We present arguments why this winding leaves the mass
spectrum continuous. The lower bound on the mass spectrum is set by the winding
number and corresponds to a BPS state.
