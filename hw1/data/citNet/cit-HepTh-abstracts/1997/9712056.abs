  Deriglazov and Galajinsky have recently proposed a new covariant action for
the Green-Schwarz superstring which can be constructed in any spacetime
dimension. In this short note, I show that their action contains extra on-shell
degrees of freedom as compared with the standard action, and is therefore
inequivalent.
