  Although axial QED suffers from a gauge anomaly, gauge invariance may be
maintained by the addition of a nonlocal counterterm. Such nonlocal
conterterms, however, are expected to ruin unitarity of the theory. We
explicitly investigate some relevant Feynman diagrams and show that, indeed,
unitarity is violated, contrary to recent claims.
