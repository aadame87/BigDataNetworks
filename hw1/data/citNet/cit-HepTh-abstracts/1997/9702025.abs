  In a spacetime with nonvanishing torsion there can occur topologically
stable configurations associated with the frame bundle which are independent
of the curvature. The relevant topological invariants are integrals of local
scalar densities first discussed by Nieh and Yan (N-Y). In four dimensions,
the N-Y form $N= (T^a \wedge T_a - R_{ab} \wedge e^a \wedge e^b)$ is the
only closed 4-form invariant under local Lorentz rotations associated with
the torsion of the manifold. The integral of $N$ over a compact D-dimensional
(Euclidean) manifold is shown to be a topological invariant related to the
Pontryagin classes of SO(D+1) and SO(D). An explicit example of a
topologically nontrivial configuration carrying nonvanishing instanton number
proportional to $\int N$ is costructed. The chiral anomaly in a
four-dimensional spacetime with torsion is also shown to contain a
contribution proportional to $N$, besides the usual Pontryagin density
related to the spacetime curvature. The violation of chiral symmetry can thus
depend on the instanton number of the tangent frame bundle of the manifold.
Similar invariants can be constructed in D>4 dimensions and the existence of
the corresponding nontrivial excitations is also discussed.
