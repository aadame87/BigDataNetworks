  We consider the maximal central extension of the supertranslation algebra in
d=4 and 3, which includes tensor central charges associated to topological
defects such as domain walls (membranes) and strings. We show that for all
N-extended superalgebras these charges are related to nontrivial configurations
on the scalar moduli space. For N=2 theories obtained from compactification on
Calabi-Yau threefolds, we give an explicit realization of the moduli-dependent
charges in terms of wrapped branes.
