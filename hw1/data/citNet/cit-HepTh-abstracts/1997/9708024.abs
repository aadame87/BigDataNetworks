  background of antisymmetric fields

  An application of the Newman-Penrose dyad formalism for description of
tensionless (null) string dynamics in 4D Minkowski spacetime is studied in a
background of antisymmetric fields. We present a special class of background
antisymmetric fields which admits exact solutions of the null string motion
equations and formulate a sufficient condition of the absence of interaction of
a null string with such fields.
