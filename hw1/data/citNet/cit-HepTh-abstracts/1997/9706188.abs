  The non-relativistic Maxwell-Chern-Simons model recently introduced by Manton
is shown to admit self-dual vortex solutions with non-zero electric field. The
interrelated ``geometric'' and ``hidden'' symmetries are explained. The theory
is also extended to (non-relativistic) spinors. A relativistic, self-dual
model, whose non-relativistic limit is the Manton model is also presented. The
relation to previous work is discussed.
