  We continue to study 5d N=1 supersymmetric field theories and their
compactifications on a circle through brane configurations. We develop a model,
which we call (p,q) Webs, which enables simple geometrical computations to
reproduce the known results, and facilitates further study. The physical
concepts of field theory are transparent in this picture, offering an
interpretation for global symmetries, local symmetries, the effective (running)
coupling, the Coulomb and Higgs branches, the monopole tensions, and the mass
of BPS particles. A rule for the dimension of the Coulomb branch is found by
introducing Grid Diagrams. Some known classifications of field theories are
reproduced. In addition to the study of the vacuum manifold we develop methods
to determine the BPS spectrum. Some states, such as quarks, correspond to
instantons inside the 5-brane which we call strips. In general, these may not
be identified with (p,q) strings. We describe how a strip can bend out of a
5-brane, becoming a string. A general BPS state corresponds to a Web of strings
and strips. For special values of the string coupling a few strips can combine
and leave the 5-brane as a string.
