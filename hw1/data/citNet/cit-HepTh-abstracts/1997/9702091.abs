Title: Wilson Loop on a Light-Cone Cylinder

  QCD without matter and quantized on a light-cone spatial cylinder is
considered. For the gauge group SU(N) the theory has N-1 quantum mechanical
degrees of freedom, which describe the color fux that circulates around the the
spatial cylinder. In 1+1 dimensions this problem can be solved analytically. I
use the solution for SU(2) to compute the Wilson loop phase on the surface of
the cylinder and find that it is equal to g^2 area/4. This result is different
from the well known result for flat space. I argue that for SU(N) the Wilson
loop phase for a contour on a light-cone spatial cylinder is g^2(area) (N-1)/4.
The underlying reason for this result is that only the N-1 dimensional Cartan
subgroup of SU(N) is dynamical in this problem.
