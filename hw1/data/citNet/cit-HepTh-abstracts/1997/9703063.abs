  We construct the N=2, D=9 supergravity theory up to the quartic fermionic
terms and derive the supersymmetry transformation rules for the fields modulo
cubic fermions. We consider a class of p-brane solutions of this theory, the
stainless p-branes, which cannot be isotropically oxidized into higher
dimensions. The new stainless elementary membrane and elementary particle
solutions are found. It is explicitly verified that these solutions preserve
half of the supersymmetry.
