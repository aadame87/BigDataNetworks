  Following systematically the generalized Hamiltonian approach of Batalin,
Fradkin and Tyutin (BFT), we embed the second-class non-abelian SU(2) Higgs
model in the unitary gauge into a gauge invariant theory. The strongly
involutive Hamiltonian and constraints are obtained as an infinite power series
in the auxiliary fields. Furthermore, comparing these results with those
obtained from the gauged second class Lagrangian, we arrive at a simple
interpretation for the first class Hamiltonian, constraints and observables.
