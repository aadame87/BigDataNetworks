Title: Chiral solitons from dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons gauged
  coupled non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger model

\\
  The soliton structure of a gauge theory proposed to describe chiral
excitations in the multi-Layer Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is investigated.
A new type of derivative multi-component nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation
emerges as effective description of the system that supports novel chiral
solitons. We discuss the classical properties of the solutions and study
relations to integrable systems.
