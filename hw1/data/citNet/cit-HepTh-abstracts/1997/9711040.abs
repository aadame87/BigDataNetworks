  We present a class of BPS solutions of the IIB Matrix Theory which preserve
1/4 supersymmetry. The solutions desrcibe D-string configurations with
left-moving oscillations. We demonstrate that the one-loop quantum effective
action of Matrix Theory vanishes for this solution, confirming its BPS nature.
We also study the world-volume gauge theory of oscillating strings and show its
connection with static D-strings.
