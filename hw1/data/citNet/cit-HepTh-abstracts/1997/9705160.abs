  A manifestly S-dual, and `12 dimensional', IIB superstring action with an
$Sl(2;\bR)$ doublet of `Born-Infeld' fields is presented. The M-theory origin
of the 12th dimension is the M-2-brane tension, which can be regarded as the
flux of a 3-form worldvolume field strength. The latter is required by the fact
that the M-2-brane can have a boundary on an M-5-brane.
