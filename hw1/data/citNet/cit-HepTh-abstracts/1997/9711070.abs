Author: Pierre van Baal

  Duality and Non-perturbative Aspects of QCD'', Newton Institute, Cambridge,

  This lecture is dedicated to the memory of Vladimir Gribov.
  We discuss the procedure of complete gauge fixing to avoid Gribov copies, as
well as results for the low-lying glueball spectrum in intermediate volumes for
the torus and for the sphere that became available recently.
