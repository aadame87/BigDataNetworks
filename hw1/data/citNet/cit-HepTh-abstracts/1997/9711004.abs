  New CP1-soliton behaviour on a flat torus is reported. Defined by the
Weierstrass elliptic function and numerically-evolved from rest, each soliton
splits up in two lumps which eventually reunite, divide and get back together
again, etc.. This result invites speculation on the question of fractional
topological charge.
