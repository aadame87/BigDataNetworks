  We illustrate the phase structure of a deformed two-dimensional Gross-Neveu
model which is defined by undeformed field contents plus deformed Pauli
matrices. This deformation is based on two motives to find a more general
polymer model and to estimate how $q$-deformed field theory affects on its
effective potential. There found some regions where chiral symmetry breaking
and restoration take place repeatedly as temperature increasing.
