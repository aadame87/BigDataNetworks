  It is shown that, in QED$_{3}$, the Pauli-Villars regularization involving a
pair of auxiliary fermion fields with masses of opposite sign leads to results
that are consistent with those obtained using all other parity-preserving
schemes of regularization. At the same time, ambiguity problems remain unsolved
in non-Abelian models (QCD$_{3}$).
