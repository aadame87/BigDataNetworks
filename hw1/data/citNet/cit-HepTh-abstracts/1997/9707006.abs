  There are known problems of Lorentz-Dirac equation for moving with
acceleration charged particle in classical electrodynamics. The model of
extended in one dimension particle is proposed and shown that electromagnetic
self-interaction can lead (with appropriate choice of retarded and advanced
interactions) to zero change in particle momentum. The hypothesis is
formulated: all relativistic internal forces of various nature can give zero
change in particle momentum
