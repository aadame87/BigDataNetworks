  The interaction of a spin 1/2 particle (described by the non-relativistic
"Dirac" equation of L\'evy-Leblond) with Chern-Simons gauge fields is studied.
It is shown, that similarly to the four dimensional spinor models, there is a
consistent possibility of coupling them also by axial or chiral type currents.
Static self dual vortex solutions together with a vortex-lattice are found with
the new couplings.
