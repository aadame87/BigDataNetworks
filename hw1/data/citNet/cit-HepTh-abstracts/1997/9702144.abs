  Infinite-dimensional algebras of hidden symmetries of the self-dual
Yang-Mills equations are considered. A current-type algebra of symmetries and
an affine extension of conformal symmetries introduced recently are discussed
using the twistor picture. It is shown that the extended conformal symmetries
of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations have a simple description in terms of
Ward's twistor construction.
