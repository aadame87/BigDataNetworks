  We show that the field equations for the supercoordinates and the self--dual
antisymmetric tensor field derived from the recently constructed
kappa-invariant action for the M theory five-brane are equivalent to the
equations of motion obtained in the doubly supersymmetric geometrical approach
at the worldvolume component level.
