  The connection between the anomalous dimension and some invariance properties
of the fixed point actions within exact RG is explored. As an application,
Polchinski equation at next-to-leading order in the derivative expansion is
studied. For the Wilson fixed point of the one-component scalar theory in three
dimensions we obtain the critical exponents \eta=0.042, \nu=0.622 and
\omega=0.754.
