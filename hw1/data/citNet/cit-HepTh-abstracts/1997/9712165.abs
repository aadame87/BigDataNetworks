  We derive the embedding structure of unitary N=2 minimal models and show as a
result that these representations have a degeneration of uncharged singular
states. This corrects some earlier mistakes made in the literature. We discuss
the connexion to the N=2 character formulae and finally give a proof for the
embedding diagrams.
