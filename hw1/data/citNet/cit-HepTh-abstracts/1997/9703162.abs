  We discuss how to represent the non-associative octonionic structure in terms
of the associative matrix algebra using the left and right octonionic
operators. As an example we construct explicitly some Lie and Super Lie
algebra. Then we discuss the notion of octonionic Grassmann numbers and explain
its possible application for giving a superspace formulation of the minimal
supersymmetric Yang-Mills models.
