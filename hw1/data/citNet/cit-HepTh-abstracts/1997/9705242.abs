  In this paper we discuss a class of 1+1 dimensional matrix field theories in
the light-cone Hamiltonian approach that are obtained from a dimensional
reduction of 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We present exact massless
solutions of the boundstate integral equations in the large N limit. These
massless states have constant wavefunctions in momentum space and are therefore
fundamental excitations of the theory.
