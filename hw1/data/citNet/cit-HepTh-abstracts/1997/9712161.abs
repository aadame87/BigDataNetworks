  We show that the nonlinear Born-Infeld field equations supplemented by the
"dynamical condition" (certain boundary condition for the field along the
particle's trajectory) define perfectly deterministic theory, i.e. particle's
trajectory is determined without any equations of motion. It is a first step
towards constructing the consistent theory of point particles interacting with
nonlinear electromagnetism.
