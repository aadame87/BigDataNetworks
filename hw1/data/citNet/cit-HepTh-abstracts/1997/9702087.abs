  The Zeroth and First Laws of Black Hole Mechanics are derived in the context
of non-linear electrodynamics coupled to gravity. The Zeroth Law is shown to
hold quite generally even if the Dominant Energy Condition is violated. The
derivation of the First Law is discussed in detail for general matter fields
coupled to gravity. The general mass variation formula obtained includes a term
previously omitted in some of the literature. This is then applied to the case
of non-linear electrodynamics and the usual First Law is found to hold true. As
an example, Born-Infeld theory is discussed. The results are extended to
include scalar fields in a very general way, including additional terms arising
from the variation of the asymptotic values of the scalars.
