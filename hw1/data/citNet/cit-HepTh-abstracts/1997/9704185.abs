  We provide evidence that some four-dimensional N=1 string vacua with
different numbers of generations are connected through phase transitions. The
transitions involve going through a point in moduli space where there is a
nontrivial fixed point governing the low energy field theory. In an M-theory
description, the examples involve wrapped 5-branes leaving one of the ends of
the world.
