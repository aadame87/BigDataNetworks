  In an abelian gauge theory, the Coulombic potential between two static
charges is obtained most directly when a correct separation between
gauge-invariant and gauge degrees of freedom is made. This motivates a similar
separation in the nonabelian theory. When a careful identification of the
Hilbert space is made, along with the proper analyticity requirements, it is
then possible to find the appropriate wavefunctionals describing heavy color
sources in the theory. This treatment is consistent with, and realizes in a
simple way the center symmetry Z_N of SU(N) gauge theories.
