  We study some geometrical and topological aspects of the generalised
dimensional reduction of supergravities in D=11 and D=10 dimensions, which give
rise to massive theories in lower dimensions. In these reductions, a global
symmetry is used in order to allow some of the fields to have a non-trivial
dependence on the compactifying coordinates. Global consistency in the internal
space imposes topological restrictions on the parameters of the
compactification as well as the structure of the space itself. Examples that we
consider include the generalised reduction of the type IIA and type IIB
theories on a circle, and also the massive ten-dimensional theory obtained by
the generalised reduction of D=11 supergravity.
