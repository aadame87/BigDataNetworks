  In this note we study the resolution of conifold singularity by D-branes by
considering compactification of D-branes on $\C^3/(\Z_2\times\Z_2)$. The
resulting vacuum moduli space of D-branes is a toric variety which turns out to
be a resolved conifold, that is a nodal variety in $\C^4$. This has the
implication that all the corresponding phases of Type--II string theory are
geometrical and are accessible to the D-branes, since they are related by
flops.
