  We study classical BPS five-brane solutions in the Horava-Witten
supergravity. The presence of the eleventh dimension add a new feature, namely
the dependence of the solution on this new coordinate. For gauge five-branes
with an instanton size less than the eleventh radius and in the neighborhood of
the center of the neutral five-brane, important corrections to the
ten-dimensional solution appear for all values of the string coupling constant.
We compute the mass and magnetic charge of the five-brane solitons and the
result is shown to agree with the membrane and five-brane quantization
conditions. Compactified to four dimensions, our solutions are interpreted as
axionic strings.
