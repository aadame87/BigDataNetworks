  We show that the boundary state description of a Dp-brane is strictly related
to the corresponding classical solution of the low-energy string effective
action. By projecting the boundary state on the massless states of the closed
string we obtain the tension, the R-R charge and the large distance behavior of
the classical solution. We discuss both the case of a single D-brane and that
of bound states of two D-branes. We also show that in the R-R sector the
boundary state, written in a picture which treats asymmetrically the left and
right components, directly yields the R-R gauge potentials.
