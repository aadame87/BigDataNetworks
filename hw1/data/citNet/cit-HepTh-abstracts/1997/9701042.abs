  We present a general rule determining how extremal branes can interesect in a
configuration with zero binding energy. The rule is derived in a model
independent way and in arbitrary spacetime dimensions $D$ by solving the
equations of motion of gravity coupled to a dilaton and several different
$n$-form field strengths. The intersection rules are all compatible with
supersymmetry, although derived without using it. We then specialize to the
branes occurring in type II string theories and in M-theory. We show that the
intersection rules are consistent with the picture that open branes can have
boundaries on some other branes. In particular, all the D-branes of dimension
$q$, with $1\leq q \leq6$, can have boundaries on the solitonic 5-brane.
