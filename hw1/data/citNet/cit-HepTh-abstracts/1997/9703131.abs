  We identify a class of 2+1 dimensional models, involving multiple
Chern-Simons gauge fields, in which a form of classical confinement occurs.
This confinement is not cumulative, but allows finite mass combinations of
individually confined objects, as in baryons. The occurrence and nature of the
phenomena depends on number theoretic properties of the couplings and charges.
