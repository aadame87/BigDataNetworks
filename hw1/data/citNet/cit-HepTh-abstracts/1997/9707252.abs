  We perform the dimensional reduction of the nonrelativistic CP(1) model
coupled to an Abelian Chern-Simons gauge field in the self-dual limit, and
investigate the soliton and domain wall solutions of the emerging 1+1
dimensional self-dual spin system. This system is described by inhomogeneous
Landau-Lifshitz system with an extra non-local term. The Hamiltonian is
Bogomol'nyi bounded from below and has four adjusting parameters. The
Bogomol'nyi equation is described in detail in analogy with the Newtonian
equation of motion and its numerical solution is presented.
