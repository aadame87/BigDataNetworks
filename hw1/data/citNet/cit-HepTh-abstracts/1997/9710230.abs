  We discuss the relation between the Ramond-Ramond charges of D-branes and the
topology of Chan-Paton vector bundles. We show that a topologically nontrivial
normal bundle induces RR charge and that the result fits in perfectly with the
proposal that D-brane charge is the topology of the Chan-Paton bundle, regarded
as an element of K-theory.
