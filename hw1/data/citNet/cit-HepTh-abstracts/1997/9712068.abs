  We find Wess-Zumino actions for kappa invariant IIB D-branes in the explicit
form. A simple and compact expression is obtained by the grace of spinor
variables which are defined as power series of differential forms. Once
explicit form of the Wess-Zumino actions is determined, global supersymmetry
(SUSY) charges and constraint equations including local supersymmetry (kappa)
generators can be determined. The SUSY algebra and the central charges are also
calculated explicitly.
