  We generalize the Drinfeld-Sokolov formalism of bosonic integrable
hierarchies to superspace, in a way which systematically leads to the zero
curvature formulation for the supersymmetric integrable systems starting from
the Lax equation in superspace. We use the method of symmetric space as well as
the non-Abelian gauge technique to obtain the supersymmetric integrable
hierarchies of the AKNS type from the zero curvature condition in superspace
with the graded algebras, sl(n+1,n), providing the Hermitian symmetric space
structure.
