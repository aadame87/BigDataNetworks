  I attempt to give a pedagogical introduction to the matrix model of M-theory
as developed by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind (BFSS). In the first
lecture, I introduce and review the relevant aspects of D-branes with the
emergence of the matrix model action. The second lecture deals with the
appearance of eleven-dimensional supergravity and M-theory in strongly coupled
type IIA superstring theory. The third lecture combines the material of the two
previous ones to arrive at the BFSS conjecture and explains the evidence
presented by these authors. The emphasis is not on most recent developments but
on a hopefully pedagogical presentation.
