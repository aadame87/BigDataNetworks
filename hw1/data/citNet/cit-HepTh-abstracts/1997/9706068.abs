  We make a detailed investigation on the quantum corrections to Chern-Simons
spinor electrodynamics. Starting from Chern-Simons spinor quantum
electrodynamics with the Maxwell term $-1/(4\gamma){\int}d^3x
F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ and by calculating the vacuum polarization tensor,
electron self-energy and on-shell vertex, we explicitly show that the Ward
identity is satisfied and hence verify that the physical quantities are
independent of the procedure of taking ${\gamma}{\to}{\infty}$ at one-loop and
tree levels. In particular, we find the three-dimensional analogue of the
Schwinger anomalous magnetic moment term of the electron produced from the
quantum corrections.
