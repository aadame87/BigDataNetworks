  We investigate the multi-loop correlators and the multi-point functions for
all of the scaling operators in unitary minimal conformal models coupled to
two-dimensional gravity from the two-matrix model. We show that simple fusion
rules for these scaling operators exist, and these are summarized in a compact
form as fusion rules for loops. We clarify the role of the boundary operators
and discuss its connection to how loops touch each other. We derive a general
formula for the n-resolvent correlators, and point out the structure similar to
the crossing symmetry of underlying conformal field theory. We discuss the
connection of the boundary conditions of the loop correlators to the touching
of loops for the case of the four-loop correlators.
