  A complete definition of the cycles, on the auxiliary Riemann surface defined
by Martinec and Warner for describing pure N=2 gauge theories with arbitrary
group, is provided. The strong coupling monodromies around the vanishing cycles
are shown to arise from a set of dyons which becomes massless at the
singularities. It is shown how the correct weak coupling monodromies are
reproduced and how the dyons have charges which are consistent with the
spectrum that can be calculated at weak coupling using conventional
semi-classical methods. In particular, the magnetic charges are co-root vectors
as required by the Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization condition.
