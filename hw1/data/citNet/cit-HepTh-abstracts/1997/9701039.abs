Title: Application of Microlocal Analysis to the Theory of Quantum Fields
  Interacting with a Gravitational Field
Authors: Wolfgang Junker
Comments: 7 pages, Latex, talk presented at the Conference on Partial
  Differential Equations, Potsdam 1996
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Functional Analysis
\\
  It is explained how techniques from microlocal analysis can be used to settle
some long-standing questions that arise in the study of the interaction of
quantum matter fields with a classical gravitational background field.
