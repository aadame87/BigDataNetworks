  We investigate the correlators in unitary minimal conformal models coupled to
two-dimensional gravity from the two-matrix model. We show that simple fusion
rules for all of the scaling operators exist. We demonstrate the role played by
the boundary operators and discuss its connection to how loops touch each
other.
