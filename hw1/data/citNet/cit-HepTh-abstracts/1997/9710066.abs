  We formulate new gauge principles for n supersymmetric particles in a
worldline formalism with N supersymmetries. The models provide realizations of
the more general supersymmetries that are encountered in sectors of S-theory or
Matrix theory, with a superalgebra that involves products of momenta. Due to
local gauge and kappa symmetries the n superparticle momenta and N supercharges
are constrained. The constraints have solutions only in a space with n timelike
dimensions and SO(d+n-2,n) spacetime symmetry. The cases SO(9,1), SO(10,2) and
SO(10,3), with one, two and three timelike dimensions respectively, are of
special interest. In each case, due to the constraints, the classical motion
and quantum theory of each superparticle are equivalent to the physics with a
single time-like dimension in an effective 10D superspace with SO(9,1) Lorentz
symmetry.
