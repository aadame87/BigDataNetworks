Title: On the Second Quantization of M(atrix) Theory
Author: I.V.Volovich
Comments: 3 pages, Latex, an explicit expression for the interaction
  Hamiltonian in the Boltzmannian Fock space is given

  The second quantization of M(atrix) theory in the free (Boltzmannian) Fock
space is considered. It provides a possible framework to the recent Susskind
proposal that U(N) supersymmetic Yang-Mills theories for all N might be
embedded in a single dynamical system. The second quantization of M(atrix)
theory can also be useful for the study of the Lorentz symmetry and for the
consideration of processes with creation and annihilation of D-branes.
