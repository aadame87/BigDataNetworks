  The neutral Kaon system is used to test the quantum theory of resonance
scattering and decay phenomena. The two dimensional Lee-Oehme-Yang theory with
complex Hamiltonian is obtained by truncating the complex basis vector
expansion of the exact theory in Rigged Hilbert space. This can be done for K_1
and K_2 as well as for K_S and K_L, depending upon whether one chooses the
(self-adjoint, semi-bounded) Hamiltonian as commuting or non-commuting with CP.
As an unexpected curiosity one can show that the exact theory (without
truncation) predicts long-time 2 pion decays of the neutral Kaon system even if
the Hamiltonian conserves CP.
