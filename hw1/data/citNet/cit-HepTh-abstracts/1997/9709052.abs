Title: Path Integral for Relativistic Dionium System
Authors: De-Hone Lin
Comments: 14 pages, Standard LaTex, some descriptions are preseinted in more
  accuracy
\\
  The path integral for relativistic spinless dionium atom is solved, and the
energy spectra are extracted from the resulting amplitude.
