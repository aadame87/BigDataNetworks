  In this work we calculate two two-loop massless Feynman integrals pertaining
to self-energy diagrams using NDIM (Negative Dimensional Integration Method).
We show that the answer we get is 36-fold degenerate. We then consider special
cases of exponents for propagators and the outcoming results compared with
known ones obtained via traditional methods.
