  We study the QED bound-state problem in a light-front hamiltonian approach.
It is important to establish the equivalence (or not) of equal-time and
light-front approaches in the well-understood arena of Quantum Electrodynamics.
Along these lines, the singlet-triplet ground state spin splitting in
positronium is calculated. The well-known result, $(7/6) \alpha^2 Ryd$,
is obtained analytically, which establishes the equivalence between the
equal-time and light-front approaches (at least to this order). The true
equivalence of the two approaches can only be established after higher-order
calculations. It was previously shown that this light-front result could be
obtained analytically, but a simpler method is presented in this paper.
