  A method for calculation of the DWSG coefficients for operators in spaces
with metric incompatible with connection is suggested based on a generalization
of the pseudodifferential operators technique. By using the proposed method,
the lowest DWSG coefficients are calculated for minimal operators of the second
and fourth order and for nonminimal operators of the type $H^{\mu\nu} = -
g^{\mu\nu} g_{\alpha\beta}\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta} +
a\nabla^{\mu}\nabla^{\nu} + X^{\mu\nu}$ in spaces with metric incompatible with
connection.
