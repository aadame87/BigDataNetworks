  The question that guides our discussion is how did the geometry and particles
come into being. The present theory reveals primordial deeper structures
underlying fundamental concepts of contemporary physics. We begin with a
drastic revision of a role of local internal symmetries in physical concept of
curved geometry. A standard gauge principle of local internal symmetries is
generalized. The gravitation gauge group is proposed, which is generated by
hidden local internal symmetries. Last two parts address to the question of
physical origin of geometry and basic concepts of particle physics such as the
fields of quarks with the spins and various quantum numbers, internal
symmetries and so forth; also four basic principles of Relativity, Quantum,
Gauge and Color Confinement, which are, as it was proven, all derivative and
come into being simultaneously. The most promising aspect of our approach so
far is the fact that many of the important anticipated properties, basic
concepts and principles of particle physics are appeared quite naturally in the
framework of suggested theory.
