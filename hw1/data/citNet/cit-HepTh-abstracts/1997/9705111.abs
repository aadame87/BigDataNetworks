  As a step toward satisfactory understanding of the quantum dynamics of
Dirichlet \break (D-) particles, the amplitude for the basic process describing
the scattering of two quantized D-particles is computed in bosonic string
theory. The calucluation is performed and cross-checked using three different
methods, namely, (i) path integral, (ii) boundary state, and (iii) open-channel
operator formalism. The analysis is exact in $\al'$ and includes the first
order correction in the expansion with respect to the acceleration of the
D-particles. The resultant Lorentz-invariant amplitude is capable of describing
general non-forward scattering with recoil effects fully taken into account and
it reproduces the known result for the special case of forward scattering in
the limit of infinitely large D-particle mass. The expected form of the
amplitude for the supersymmetric case is also briefly discussed.
