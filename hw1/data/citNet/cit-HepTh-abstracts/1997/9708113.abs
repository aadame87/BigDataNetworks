  We propose a toy model to illustrate how the effective Lagrangian for super
QCD might go over to the one for ordinary QCD by a mechanism whereby the
gluinos and squarks in the fundamental theory decouple below a given
supersymmetry breaking scale $m$. The implementation of this approach involves
a suitable choice of possible supersymmetry breaking terms. An amusing feature
of the model is the emergence of the ordinary QCD degrees of freedom which were
hidden in the auxiliary fields of the supersymmetric effective Lagrangian.
