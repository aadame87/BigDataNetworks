  We consider the dynamical correlation functions of the quantum Nonlinear
Schrodinger equation. In a previous paper we found that the dynamical
correlation functions can be described by the vacuum expectation value of an
operator-valued Fredholm determinant. In this paper we show that a
Riemann-Hilbert problem can be associated with this Fredholm determinant. This
Riemann-Hilbert problem formulation permits us to write down completely
integrable equations for the Fredholm determinant and to perform an asymptotic
analysis for the correlation function.
