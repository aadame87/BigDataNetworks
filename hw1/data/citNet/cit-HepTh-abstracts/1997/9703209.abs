  We describe the structure of string vacuum states in the supersymmetric
matrix model for M theory compactified on a circle in the large-N limit. We
show that the theory admits topological instanton field configurations which at
short-distance scales reduce to ordinary Yang-Mills instantons that interpolate
between degenerate vacua of the theory. We show that there exists further
classes of hadronic strings associated with the D-string super-fields. We
discuss the relationships between these non-perturbative string states and
rigid QCD strings, critical strings, and membrane states.
