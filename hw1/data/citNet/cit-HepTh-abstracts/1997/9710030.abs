  Starting with topological field theory, we derive space-time uncertainty
relation proposed by Yoneya through breakdown of topological symmetry in the
large $N$ matrix model. Next, on the basis of only two basic principles, those
are, generalized space-time uncertainty principle containing spinor field and
topological symmetry, we construct a new matrix model. If we furthermore impose
a requirement of N=2 supersymmetry, this new matrix model exactly reduces to
the IKKT model or the Yoneya model for IIB superstring depending on an
appropriate choice for a scalar function. A key feature of these formulations
is an appearance of the nontrivial "dynamical" theory through breakdown of
topological symmetry in the matrix model. It is closely examined why the
nontrivial "dynamical" theory appears from the trivial topological field
theory.
