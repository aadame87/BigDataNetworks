  We present a spontaneously broken N=2 supergravity model that reduces in the
flat limit to a globally supersymmetric N=2 system with explicit soft
supersymmetry breaking terms. These soft terms generate a mass O(100 GeV) for
mirror quarks and leptons, while leaving the physical fermions light, thereby
overcoming one of the major obstacles towards the construction of a realistic
N=2 model of elementary interactions.
