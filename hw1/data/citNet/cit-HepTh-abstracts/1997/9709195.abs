  An approximation is used that permits one to explicitly solve the two-point
Schwinger-Dyson equations of the U(N) lattice chiral models. The approximate
solution correctly predicts a phase transition for dimensions $d$ greater than
two. For $d \le 2 $, the system is in a single disordered phase with a mass
gap. The method reproduces known $N=\infty$ results well for $d=1$. For $d=2$,
there is a moderate difference with $N=\infty$ results only in the intermediate
coupling constant region.
