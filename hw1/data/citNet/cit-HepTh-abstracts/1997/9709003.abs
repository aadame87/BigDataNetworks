  We describe gauge-fixing at the level of virtual paths in the path integral
as a non-symplectic BRST-type of flow on the path phase space. As a consequence
a gauge-fixed, non-local symplectic structure arises. Restoring of locality is
discussed. A pertinent anti-Lie-bracket and an infinite dimensional group of
gauge fermions are introduced. Generalizations to Sp(2)-symmetric BLT-theories
are made.
