  We consider a 1+1 dimensional field theory which contains both a complex
fermion field and a real scalar field. We then construct a unitary operator
that, by a similarity transformation, gives a continuum of equivalent theories
which smoothly interpolate between the massive Thirring model and the
sine-Gordon model. This provides an implementation of smooth bosonization
proposed by Damgaard et al. as well as an example of a quantum canonical
transformation for a quantum field theory.
