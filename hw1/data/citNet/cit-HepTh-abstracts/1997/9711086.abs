  We discuss charged black-hole solutions to the equations of motion of the
string-loop-corrected effective action. At the string-tree level, these
solutions provide backgrounds for the "chiral null model". The effective action
contains gravity, dilaton and moduli fields. Analytic solutions of the
one-loop-corrected equations of motion are presented for the extremal magnetic
and dyonic black holes. Using the fact that in magnetic solution the
loop-corrected dilaton is non-singular at the origin, we apply the
correspondence principle to show that the entropy of the loop-corrected
magnetic black hole can be interpreted as the microscopic entropy of the
D-brane system.
