  5-branes of nontrivial topology are associated in the
Diaconescu-Hanany-Witten-Witten (DHWW) approach with the Seiberg-Witten (SW)
theory of low-energy effective actions. There are two different "pictures",
related to the IIA and IIB phases of M-theory. They differ by the choice of
$6d$ theory on the 5-brane world volume. In the IIB picture it is just the 6d
SUSY Yang-Mills, while in the IIA picture it is a theory of SUSY self-dual
2-form. These two pictures appear capable to describe the (non-abelian) Lax
operator and (abelian) low-energy effective action respectively. Thus IIB-IIA
duality is related to the duality between Hitchin and Whitham integrable
structures.
