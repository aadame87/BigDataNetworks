\\
  The $SL(2,R)$ duality symmetric action for the Born-Infeld theory in terms of
two potentials, coupled with non-trivial backgroud fields in four dimensions is
established. This construction is carried out in detail by analysing the
hamiltonian structure of the Born-Infeld theory. The equivalence with the usual
Born-Infeld theory is shown.
