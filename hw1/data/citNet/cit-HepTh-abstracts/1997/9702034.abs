  We extend work done previously concerning the formation of vortices in a
U(1)->1 gauge theory at a first order phase transition to the symmetry breaking
SU(2)xU(1)->U(1). It is shown that the collision of bubbles, appearing at the
phase transition, allow the possibility for forming non-topological strings
associated with the gauge group. The method used also shows clearly how these
vortices are related to the Nielsen-Olesen vortices.
