  This paper presents a 6d world-volume action that describes the dynamics of
the M theory five-brane in a flat 11d space-time background. The world-volume
action has global 11d super-Poincare invariance, as well as 6d general
coordinate invariance and kappa symmetry, which are realized as local
symmetries. The paper mostly considers a formulation in which general
coordinate invariance is not manifest in one direction. However, it also
describes briefly an alternative formulation, due to Pasti, Sorokin, and Tonin,
in which general coordinate invariance is manifest. The latter approach
requires auxiliary fields and new gauge invariances.
