  We obtain a low-energy effective superpotential for a phase with a single
confined photon in N=1 gauge theory with an adjoint matter with ADE gauge
groups. The expectation values of gauge invariants built out of the adjoint
field parametrize the singularities of moduli space of the Coulomb phase. The
result can be used to derive the N=2 curve in the form of a foliation over
$CP^1$. Our N=1 theory exhibits non-trivial fixed points which naturally
inherit the properties of the ADE classification of N=2 superconformal field
theories in four dimensions. We also discuss how to include matter
hypermultiplets toward deriving the Riemann surface which describes N=2 QCD
with exceptional gauge groups.
