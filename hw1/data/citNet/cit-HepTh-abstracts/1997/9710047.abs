  We propose a geometric method to parameterize inequivalent vacua by dynamical
data. Introducing quantum Clifford algebras with arbitrary bilinear forms we
distinguish isomorphic algebras --as Clifford algebras-- by different
filtrations resp. induced gradings. The idea of a vacuum is introduced as the
unique algebraic projection on the base field embedded in the Clifford algebra,
which is however equivalent to the term vacuum in axiomatic quantum field
theory and the GNS construction in C^*-algebras. This approach is shown to be
equivalent to the usual picture which fixes one product but employs a variety
of GNS states. The most striking novelty of the geometric approach is the fact
that dynamical data fix uniquely the vacuum and that positivity is not
required. The usual concept of a statistical quantum state can be generalized
to geometric meaningful but non-statistical, non-definite, situations.
Furthermore, an algebraization of states takes place. An application to physics
is provided by an U(2)-symmetry producing a gap-equation which governs a phase
transition. The parameterization of all vacua is explicitly calculated from
propagator matrix elements. A discussion of the relation to BCS theory and
Bogoliubov-Valatin transformations is given.
