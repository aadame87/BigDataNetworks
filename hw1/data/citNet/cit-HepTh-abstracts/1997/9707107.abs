  The duality properties of perturbative string characters associated with the
transverse space-time rotations are studied. T duality is achieved by suitably
integrating over the total momentum, contrary to earlier discussions. The O(8)
triality properties of the characters for critical superstrings, are derived.
This shows the existence of a third formulation (unnoticed so far to our
knowledge) equivalent to, but different from the ones of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond,
and Green-Schwarz. Projectors in the NS and R sectors are defined in the GS
formalism. The consequences of supersymmetry are neatly derived at once for all
massive states by factorising the character of the long SUSY multiplet.
