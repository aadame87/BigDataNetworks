Title: Quantum equivalence of sigma models related by non Abelian Duality
  Transformations

Comments: As a result of the collaboration of new authors the previously
  overlooked gauge contribution is inserted into eq.(43) changing not so much
  the formulae as part of the conclusion: for the models considered non Abelian
  duality is OK in one loop

  Coupling constant renormalization is investigated in 2 dimensional sigma
models related by non Abelian duality transformations. In this respect it is
shown that in the one loop order of perturbation theory the duals of a one
parameter family of models, interpolating between the SU(2) principal model and
the O(3) sigma model, exhibit the same behaviour as the original models. For
the O(3) model also the two loop equivalence is investigated, and is found to
be broken just like in the already known example of the principal model.
