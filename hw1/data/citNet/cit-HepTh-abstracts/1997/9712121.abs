  The exact perturbation approach is used to derive the elementary correlation
lengths $\xi_i$ and related mass gaps $m_i$ of the two-dimensional dilute A_L
lattice model in regimes 1 and 2 for L odd from the Bethe Ansatz solution. In
regime 2 the A_3 model is the E_8 lattice realisation of the two-dimensional
Ising model in a magnetic field at T=T_c. The calculations for the A_3 model in
regime 2 start from the eight thermodynamically significant string types found
in previous numerical studies. These string types are seen to be consistent in
the ordered high field limit. The eight masses obtained reduce with the
approach to criticality to the E_8 masses predicted by Zamolodchikov, thus
providing a further direct lattice determination of the E_8 mass spectrum.
