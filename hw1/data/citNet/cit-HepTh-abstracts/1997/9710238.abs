  We compute the Schwinger terms in the energy-momentum tensor commutator
algebra from the anomalies present in Weyl-invariant and
diffeomorphism-invariant effective actions for two dimensional massless scalar
fields in a gravitational background. We find that the Schwinger terms are not
sensitive to the regularization procedure and that they are independent of the
background metric.
