  We examine harmonic oscillator defects coupled to a photon field in the
environs of an optical fiber. Using techniques borrowed or extended from the
theory of two dimensional quantum fields with boundaries and defects, we are
able to compute exactly a number of interesting quantities. We calculate the
scattering S-matrices (i.e. the reflection and transmission amplitudes) of the
photons off a single defect. We determine using techniques derived from
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) the thermodynamic potentials of the
interacting photon-defect system. And we compute several correlators of
physical interest. We find the photon occupancy at finite temperature, the
spontaneous emission spectrum from the decay of an excited state, and the
correlation functions of the defect degrees of freedom. In an extension of the
single defect theory, we find the photonic band structure that arises from a
periodic array of harmonic oscillators. In another extension, we examine a
continuous array of defects and exactly derive its dispersion relation. With
some differences, the spectrum is similar to that found for EM wave propagation
in covalent crystals. We then add to this continuum theory isolated defects, so
as to obtain a more realistic model of defects embedded in a frequency
dependent dielectric medium. We do this both with a single isolated defect and
with an array of isolated defects, and so compute how the S-matrices and the
band structure change in a dynamic medium.
