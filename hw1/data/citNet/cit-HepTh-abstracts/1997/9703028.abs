  We study correlation functions of coset constructions by utilizing the method
of gauge dressing. As an example we apply this method to the minimal models and
to the Witten 2D black hole. We exhibit a striking similarity between the
latter and the gravitational dressing. In particular, we look for logarithmic
operators in the 2D black hole.
