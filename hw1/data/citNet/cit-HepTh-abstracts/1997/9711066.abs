  A C*-algebra containing the CCR and CAR algebras as its subalgebras and
naturally described as the semidirect product of these algebras is discussed. A
particular example of this structure is considered as a model for the algebra
of asymptotic fields in quantum electrodynamics, in which Gauss' law is
respected. The appearence in this algebra of a phase variable related to
electromagnetic potential leads to the universal charge quantization.
Translationally covariant representations of this algebra with energy-momentum
spectrum in the future lightcone are investigated. It is shown that vacuum
representations are necessarily nonregular with respect to total
electromagnetic field. However, a class of translationally covariant,
irreducible representations is constructed excplicitly, which remain as close
as possible to the vacuum, but are regular at the same time. The spectrum of
energy-momentum fills the whole future lightcone, but there are no vectors with
energy-momentum lying on a mass hyperboloid or in the origin.
