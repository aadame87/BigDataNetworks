  Sigma models describing low energy effective actions on D0-brane probes with
N=8 supercharges are studied in detail using a manifestly d=1, N=4 super-space
formalism. Two 0+1 dimensional N=4 multiplets together with their general
actions are constructed. We derive the condition for these actions to be N=8
supersymmetric and apply these techniques to various D-brane configurations. We
find that if in addition to N=8 supersymmetry the action must also have Spin(5)
invariance, the form of the sigma model metric is uniquely determined by the
one-loop result and is not renormalized perturbatively or non-perturbatively.
