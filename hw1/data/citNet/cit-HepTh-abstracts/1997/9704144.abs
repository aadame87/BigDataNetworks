  We construct an explicit covariant Majorana formulation of Maxwell
electromagnetism which does not make use of vector 4-potential. This allows to
write a ``Dirac'' equation for the photon containing all the known properties
of it. In particular, the spin and (intrinsic) boost matrices are derived and
the helicity properties of the photon are studied.
