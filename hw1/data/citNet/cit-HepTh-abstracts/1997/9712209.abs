  We propose a string-theoretic ansatz describing the dynamics of SU(N)
Yang-Mills theories in the limit of large N in D=4. The construction uses in a
crucial way open-string vertex operators that describe non-perturbative brane
dynamics. According to our proposal, various gauge theories are described by
string theories with the same action, but with different measures in the
functional integral. The choice of measure defines the gauge group, as well as
the effective space-time dimension of the resulting gauge theory.
