Title: Conformal field theory and graphs
Authors: V.B. Petkova and J.-B. Zuber
Comments: Plain Tex, 7 pages; 2 figures. Talk given at the 21st International
  Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Goslar, Germany, 15-20

  We review a method of construction of exceptional graphs generalising the ADE
Dynkin diagrams which encode the spectrum of conformal field theories described
by conformal embeddings of $\widehat{sl}(n)_k$.
