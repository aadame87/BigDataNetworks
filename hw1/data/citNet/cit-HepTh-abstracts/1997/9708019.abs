  Functional measures for lattice quantum gravity should agree with their
continuum counterparts in the weak field, low momentum limit. After showing
that the standard simplicial measure satisfies the above requirement, we prove
that a class of recently proposed non-local measures for lattice gravity do not
satisfy such a criterion, already to lowest order in the weak field expansion.
We argue therefore that the latter cannot represent acceptable discrete
functional measures for simplicial geometries.
