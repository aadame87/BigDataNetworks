  In quantum gravity, fields may lose quantum coherence by scattering off
vacuum fluctuations in which virtual black hole pairs appear and disappear.
Although it is not possible to properly compute the scattering off such
fluctuations, we argue that one can get useful qualitative results, which
provide a guide to the possible effects of such scattering, by considering a
quantum field on the $C$ metric, which has the same topology as a virtual black
hole pair. We study a scalar field on the Lorentzian $C$ metric background,
with the scalar field in the analytically-continued Euclidean vacuum state. We
find that there are a finite number of particles at infinity in this state,
contrary to recent claims made by Yi. Thus, this state is not determined by
data at infinity, and there is loss of quantum coherence in this semi-classical
calculation.
