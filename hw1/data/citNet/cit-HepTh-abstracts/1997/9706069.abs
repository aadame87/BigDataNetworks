  We show that the strength of the leading non-perturbative effects in
non-critical string theory is of the order $e^{-O(1/{\beta_{st}})}$. We show
how this restricts the space of consistent theories. We also identify
non-critical one dimensional D-instantons as dynamical objects which exchange
closed string states and calculate the order of their size.
