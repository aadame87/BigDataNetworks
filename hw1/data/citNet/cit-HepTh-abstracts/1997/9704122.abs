\\
  Halpern's field strength's formulation of gauge theories is applied to
effective QED_3, namely, a gauge invariant theory for an Abelian gauge field
$A_\mu$ with non-localities and self-interactions. The resulting description in
terms of the pseudovector field $\tilde{F}_\mu =
\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda}\partial_\nu A_\lambda$ is applied to different
examples.
