  We set up a systematic expansion of the prepotential for ${\cal N}=2$
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with SU(N) gauge group in the region of
strong coupling where a maximal number of mutually local fields become
massless. In particular, we derive the first non-trivial non-perturbative
correction, which is the first term in the strong coupling expansion providing
a coupling between the different U(1) factors, and which governs for example
the strength of gaugino Yukawa couplings.
