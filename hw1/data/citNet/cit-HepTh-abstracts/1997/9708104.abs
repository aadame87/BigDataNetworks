  A new approach is demonstrated that QFTs can be UV finite if they are viewed
as the low energy effective theories of a fundamental underlying theory (that
is complete and well-defined in all respects) according to the nowaday's
standard point of view. No subtraction procedure, counter terms and hence bare
parameters are needed. It can also be viewed as a new formulation of the
wilson's renormalization program. In contrast to the old ones, this new
approach works for any interaction model and spacetime dimensions. Its
important implications are sketched.
