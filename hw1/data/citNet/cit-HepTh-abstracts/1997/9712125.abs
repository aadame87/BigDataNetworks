  We analyse completely the BRST cohomology on local functionals for two
dimensional sigma models coupled to abelian world sheet gauge fields, including
effective bosonic D-string models described by Born-Infeld actions. In
particular we prove that the rigid symmetries of such models are exhausted by
the solutions to generalized Killing vector equations which we have presented
recently, and provide all the consistent first order deformations and candidate
gauge anomalies of the models under study. For appropriate target space
geometries we find nontrivial deformations both of the abelian gauge
transformations and of the world sheet diffeomorphisms, and antifield dependent
candidate anomalies for both types of symmetries separately, as well as mixed
ones.
