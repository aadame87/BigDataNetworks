  A new non-perturbative approach to quantum theory in curved spacetime and to
quantum gravity, based on a generalisation of the Wigner equation, is proposed.
Our definition for a Wigner equation differs from what have otherwise been
proposed, and does not imply any approximations. It is a completely exact
equation, fully equivalent to the Heisenberg equations of motion. The approach
makes different approximation schemes possible, e.g. it is possible to perform
a systematic calculation of the quantum effects order by order. An iterative
scheme for this is also proposed. The method is illustrated with some simple
examples and applications. A calculation of the trace of the renormalised
energy-momentum tensor is done, and the conformal anomaly is thereby related to
non-conservation of a current in d=2 dimensions and a relationship between a
vector and an axial-vector current in d=4 dimensions.
  The corresponding ``hydrodynamic equations'' governing the evolution of
macroscopic quantities are derived by taking appropriate moments. The emphasis
is put on the spin-1/2 case, but it is shown how to extend to arbitrary spins.
Gravity is treated first in the Palatini formalism, which is not very
tractable, and then more successfully in the Ashtekar formalism, where the
constraints lead to infinite order differential equations for the Wigner
functions.
