  We study the correspondence between the moduli space of vacua of
three-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills (Maxwell) Chern-Simons theories and
brane configurations with (p,q)5-brane. For Coulomb branches, the number of the
massless adjoint scalar fields in various supersymmetric theories exactly
coincides with the number of the freely moving directions of D3-branes
stretched between two 5-branes. When we include a matter superfield into the
supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory two distinct symmetric and asymmetric phase
appear. The symmetric phase is peculiar to this Chern-Simons Higgs system. We
find the corresponding brane configuration for these phases. We also identify
the stringy counterpart of the topological vortex state in the asymmetric
phase.
