  We construct a topological invariant of the renormalization group
trajectories of a large class of 2D quantum integrable models, described by the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz approach. A geometrical description of this
invariant in terms of triangulations of three-dimensional manifolds is proposed
and associated dilogarithm identities are proven.
