  We develop further the theory of Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) on
a cylinder with specified boundary conditions emphasizing the role of a triplet
of algebras: the Verlinde, graph fusion and Pasquier algebras. We show that
solving Cardy's equation, expressing consistency of a RCFT on a cylinder, is
equivalent to finding integer valued matrix representations of the Verlinde
algebra. These matrices allow us to naturally associate a graph $G$ to each
RCFT such that the conformal boundary conditions are labelled by the nodes of
$G$. This approach is carried to completion for $sl(2)$ theories leading to
complete sets of conformal boundary conditions, their associated cylinder
partition functions and the $A$-$D$-$E$ classification. We also review the
current status for WZW $sl(3)$ theories. Finally, a systematic generalization
of the formalism of Cardy-Lewellen is developed to allow for multiplicities
arising from more general representations of the Verlinde algebra. We obtain
information on the bulk-boundary coefficients and reproduce the relevant
algebraic structures from the sewing constraints.
