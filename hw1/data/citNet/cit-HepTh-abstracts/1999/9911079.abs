  We formulate the renormalization procedure using the domain wall
regularization that is based on the heat-kernel method. The quantum effects of
both fermions and bosons (gauge fields) are taken into account. The background
field method is quite naturally introduced. With regard to the treatment of the
loop-momentum integrals, an interesting contrast between the
fermion-determinant part and other parts is revealed. These points are
elucidated by considering some examples. The Weyl anomalies for 2D QED and 4D
QED are correctly obtained. It is found that the ``chiral solution'' produces
(1/2)$^{d/2}$ $\times$ ``correct values'', where $d$ is the spatial dimension.
Considering the model of 2D QED, both Weyl and chiral anomalies are directly
obtained from the effective action. The mass and wave function renormalization
are explicitly performed in 4D QED. We confirm the multiplicative (not
additive) renormalization, which demonstrates the advantage of no fine-tuning.
The relation with the recently popular higher-dimensional approach, such as the
Randall- Sundrum model, is commented on.
