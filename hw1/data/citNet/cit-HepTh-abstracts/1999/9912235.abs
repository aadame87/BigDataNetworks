Title: Euclidean field theory on a sphere

  This paper is concerned with a structural analysis of euclidean field
theories on the euclidean sphere. In the first section we give proposal for
axioms for a euclidean field theory on a sphere in terms of C*-algebras.
  Then, in the second section, we investigate the short-distance behavior of
euclidean field theory models on the sphere by making use of the concept of
{\em scaling algebras}, which has first been introduced by D. Buchholz, and R.
Verch and which has also be applied to euclidean field theories on flat
euclidean space in a previous paper. We establish the expected statement that
that scaling limit theories of euclidean field theories on a sphere are
euclidean field theories on flat euclidean space.
  Keeping in mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean sphere is the
de Sitter space, we develop a Osterwalder-Schrader type construction scheme
which assigns to a given euclidean field theory on the sphere a quantum field
theory on de Sitter space. We show that the constructed quantum field
theoretical data fulfills the so called geodesic KMS condition in the sense of
H. J. Borchers and D. Buchholz, i.e. for any geodesic observer the system looks
like a system within a thermal equilibrium state.
