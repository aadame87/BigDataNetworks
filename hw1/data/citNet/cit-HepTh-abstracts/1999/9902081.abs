  A new type of non-Abelian generalization of the Born-Infeld action is
proposed, in which the spacetime indices and group indices are combined. The
action is manifestly Lorentz and gauge invariant. In its power expansion, the
lowest order term is the Yang-Mills action and the second term corresponds to
the bosonic stringy correction to this action. Solutions of the Euler-Lagrange
equation for the SU(2) case are considered and we show that there exists an
instanton-like solution which has winding number one and finite action.
