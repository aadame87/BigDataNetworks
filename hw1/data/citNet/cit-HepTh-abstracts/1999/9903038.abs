  We construct SUGRA solutions of brane configurations of intersecting Dp and
NS branes. These solutions are semi-localized in the sense that one of the
intersecting branes is smeared along the world volume of the other, while the
second is localized. We examine the gauge theory that lives on the localized
brane, and the various descriptions possible via T and S dualities, and
M-theory.
