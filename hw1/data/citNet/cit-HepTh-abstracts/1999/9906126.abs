  I present cosmological arguments which point towards a Horava-Witten like
picture of the universe, with the unification scale of order the fundamental
gravitational scale. The SUSY breaking scale is determined by the dynamics of
gauge fields which are weakly coupled at the fundamental scale. Bulk moduli
whose potential originates at short distances are the inflatons, while bulk
moduli whose potential originates from SUSY breaking are the origin of the
energy density in the present era. The latter decay just before
nucleosynthesis, and a consistent theory of baryogenesis requires that there be
renormalizable baryon number violating interactions at the TeV scale. The dark
matter is a boundary modulus, perhaps the QCD axion, and the temperature of
matter radiation equality is related to the ratio between the fundamental and
effective four dimensional Planck scales. The same ratio determines the
amplitude of fluctuations in the microwave background.
