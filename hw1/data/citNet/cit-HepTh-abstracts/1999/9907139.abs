  The maximal center gauge, combined with center projection, is a means to
associate Yang-Mills lattice gauge configurations with closed center vortex
world-surfaces. This technique allows to study center vortex physics in lattice
gauge experiments. In the present work, the continuum analogue of the maximal
center gauge is constructed. This sheds new light on the meaning of the
procedure on the lattice and leads to a sketch of an effective vortex theory in
the continuum. Furthermore, the manner in which center vortex configurations
generate the Pontryagin index is investigated. The Pontryagin index is built up
from self-intersections of the vortex world-surfaces, where it is crucial that
the surfaces be globally non-oriented.
