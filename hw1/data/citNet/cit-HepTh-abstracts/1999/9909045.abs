  Neutral fermions of spin 1/2 with magnetic moment can interact with
electromagnetic fields through nonminimal coupling. In 2+1 dimensions the
electromagnetic field strength plays the same role to the magnetic moment as
the vector potential to the electric charge. This duality enables one to obtain
physical results for neutral particles from known ones for charged particles.
We give the probability of neutral particle-antiparticle pair creation in the
vacuum by non-uniform electromagnetic fields produced by constant uniform
charge and current densities.
