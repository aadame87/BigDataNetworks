  We consider the parity-invariant Dirac operator with a mass term in
three-dimensional QCD for $N_c=2$ and quarks in the fundamental representation.
We show that there exists a basis in which the matrix elements of the Euclidean
Dirac operator are real. Assuming there is spontaneous breaking of flavor
and/or parity, we read off from the fermionic action the flavor
symmetry-breaking pattern $Sp(4N_f) \to Sp(2N_f) \times Sp(2N_f)$ that might
occur in such a theory. We then construct a random matrix theory with the same
global symmetries as two-color QCD$_3$ with fundamental fermions and derive
from here the finite-volume partition function for the latter in the static
limit. The expected symmetry breaking pattern is confirmed by the explicit
calculation in random matrix theory. We also derive the first
Leutwyler-Smilga-like sum rule for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator.
