  The Schr\"odinger equation is investigated in the Euclidean Taub-NUT
geometry. The bound states are degenerate and an extra degeneracy is due to the
conserved Runge-Lenz vector. The existence of the extra conserved quantities,
quadratic in four-velocities implies the possibility of separating variables in
two different coordinate systems. The eigenvalues and the eigenvectors are
given in both cases in explicit, closed form.
