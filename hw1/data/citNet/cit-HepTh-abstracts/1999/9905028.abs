  This paper is almost an exercise in which the Hamiltonian scheme is developed
for Polyakov's classical string, by following the usual framework suggested by
Dirac and Bergman for the reduction of gauge theories to their essential
physical degrees of freedom. The results collected here will be useful in some
forthcoming papers, where strings will be studied in the unusual context of
Wigner-covariant rest frame theory.
  After a short introduction outlining the work, the Lagrangean scheme is
presented in Section II, where the classical equivalence between Polyakov and
Nambu-Goto string is rederived. In Section III the Hamiltonian framework is
worked out, primary and secondary constraints are deduced. Then Lagrange
multipliers are introduced; finally the Hamiltonian equations of motion are
presented.
  In Section IV gauge symmetries are treated, by constructing their canonical
generators; then some gauge degrees of freedom are eliminated by Dirac-Bergmann
fixing procedure. In this paper only the gauge-freedom coming from primary
constraints is fixed, while secondary constraints will need a deeper analysis.
At the end of
  Section IV the classical version of Virasoro algebra is singled out as that
of the secondary constraints, surviving to the first gauge fixing.
