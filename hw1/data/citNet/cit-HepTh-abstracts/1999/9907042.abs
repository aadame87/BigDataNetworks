  Given a symmetry group acting on a principal fibre bundle, symmetric states
of the quantum theory of a diffeomorphism invariant theory of connections on
this fibre bundle are defined. These symmetric states, equipped with a scalar
product derived from the Ashtekar-Lewandowski measure for loop quantum gravity,
form a Hilbert space of their own. Restriction to this Hilbert space yields a
quantum symmetry reduction procedure in the framework of spin network states
the structure of which is analyzed in detail. Three illustrating examples are
discussed: Reduction of 3+1 to 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity, spherically
symmetric electromagnetism and spherically symmetric gravity.
