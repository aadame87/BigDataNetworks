  In this paper we discuss two approaches to anomaly-free quantization of a
two-dimensional string. The first approach is based on the canonical Dirac
prescription of quantization of degenerated systems. At the second approach we
"weaken" the Dirac quantization conditions requiring the solving of first class
constraints only in the sense of mean values. At both approaches there are no
states with the indefinite metrics.
