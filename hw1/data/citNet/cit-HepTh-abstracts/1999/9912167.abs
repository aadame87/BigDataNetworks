  Here we discuss the ultraviolet and infrared aspects of the noncommutative
counterpart of QED, which is called as noncommutative QED, as well as some
infrared dynamics of noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theory. First we
demonstrate that the divergence in the theory can be subtracted by the similar
counterterms as in ordinary theory at one loop level. Then the anomalous
magnetic moment is calculated to see the infrared aspect of the theory which
reflects the violation of Lorentz symmetry. The evaluation of the finite part
of the photon vacuum polarization shows that the logarithmically singular term
in the infrared limit appears with the same weight as UV logarithmic
divergence, showing the correlation between the UV and infrared dynamics in
NCYM theory. NC-QED theory does not show such a property. We also consider the
extension to chiral gauge theory in the present context, but the requirement of
anomaly cancellation allows only noncommutative QED.
