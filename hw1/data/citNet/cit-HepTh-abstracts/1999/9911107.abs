  A proof of renormalizability of the theory of the dynamical non-Abelian
two-form is given using the Zinn-Justin equation. Two previously unknown
symmetries of the quantum action, different from the BRST symmetry, are needed
for the proof. One of these is a gauge fermion dependent nilpotent symmetry,
while the other mixes different fields with the same transformation properties.
The BRST symmetry itself is extended to include a shift transformation by use
of an anticommuting constant. These three symmetries restrict the form of the
quantum action up to arbitrary order in perturbation theory. The results show
that it is possible to have a renormalizable theory of massive vector bosons in
four dimensions without a residual Higgs boson.
