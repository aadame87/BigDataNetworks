  The two-point Green function of a local operator in CFT corresponding to a
massive symmetric tensor field on the AdS background is computed in the
framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The obtained two-point function is
shown to coincide with the two-point function of the graviton in the limit when
the mass vanishes.
