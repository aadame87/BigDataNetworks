  Using a sigma model formulation of the field equations as on a
two-dimensional manifold we provide the proof of a black hole uniqueness
solution in N=4, d=4 supergravity subject to certain boundary conditions. We
considered the black hole solutions both in SU(4) and SO(4) versions of the
underlying theory.
