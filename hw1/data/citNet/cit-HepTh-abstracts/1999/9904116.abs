  A longstanding puzzle concerns the calculation of the gluino condensate
<{tr\lambda^2\over 16\pi^2}> = c\Lambda^3 in N=1 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge
theory: so-called weak-coupling instanton (WCI) calculations give c=1, whereas
strong-coupling instanton (SCI) calculations give, instead,
c=2[(N-1)!(3N-1)]^{-1/N}. By examining correlators of this condensate in
arbitrary multi-instanton sectors, we cast serious doubt on the SCI calculation
of <{tr\lambda^2\over 16\pi^2}> by showing that an essential step --- namely
cluster decomposition --- is invalid. We also show that the addition of a
so-called Kovner-Shifman vacuum (in which <{tr\lambda^2\over 16\pi^2}> = 0)
cannot straightforwardly resolve this mismatch.
