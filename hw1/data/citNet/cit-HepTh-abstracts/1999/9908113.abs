  We derive a new form of loop equations for light-like Wilson loops. In
bosonic theories those loop equations close only for straight light-like Wilson
lines. In the case of N=1 in ten dimensions they close for any light-like
Wilson loop. Upon dimensional reduction to N=4 SYM in four dimensions, these
loops become exactly the chiral loops which can be evaluated semiclassically,
in the strong coupling limit, by a minimal surface in anti de-Sitter space. We
show that the AdS calculation satisfies those loop equations. We also find a
new fermionic loop equation derived from the gauge theory fermionic equation of
motion.
