  Integrable systems underlying the Seiberg-Witten solutions for the N=2 SQCD
with gauge groups SO(n) and Sp(n) are proposed. They are described by the
inhomogeneous XXX spin chain with specific boundary conditions given by
reflection matrices. We attribute reflection matrices to orientifold planes in
the brane construction and briefly discuss its possible deformations.
