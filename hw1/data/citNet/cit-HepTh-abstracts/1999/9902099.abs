  The superstring is quantized in a manner which manifestly preserves a U(5)
subgroup of the (Wick-rotated) ten-dimensional super-Poincar\'e invariance.
This description of the superstring contains critical N=2 worldsheet
superconformal invariance and is a natural covariantization of the
U(4)-invariant light-cone Green-Schwarz description.
