  We study the emission rates of scalar, spinor and vector particles from a 5
dimensional black hole for arbitrary partial waves. The solution is lifted to 6
dimensions, and the near horizon $ BTZ \times S^3$ geometry of the black hole
solution is probed to determine the greybody factors. We show that the exact
decay rates can be reproduced from a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory
which lies on the boundary of the near horizon geometry. The AdS/CFT
correspondence is used to determine the dimension of the CFT operators
corresponding to the bulk fields. These operators couple to plane waves
incident on the CFT from infinity to produce emission in the bulk.
