  We summarize recent results on the resolution of two intimately related
problems, one physical, the other mathematical. The first deals with the
resolution of the non-perturbative low energy dynamics of certain N=2
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. We concentrate on the theories with one
massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of an arbitrary gauge
algebra G. The second deals with the construction of Lax pairs with spectral
parameter for certain classical mechanics Calogero-Moser integrable systems
associated with an arbitrary Lie algebra G. We review the solution to both of
these problems as well as their interrelation.
