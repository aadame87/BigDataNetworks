  It is shown that global fermionic charges induced in vacuum by slowly
varying, topologically non-trivial background scalar fields are not
renormalized provided that expansion in momenta of background fields is valid.
This suggests that strongly coupled theories obey induced charge matching
conditions which are analogous, but generally not equivalent, to 't Hooft
anomaly matching conditions. We give a few examples of induced charge matching.
In particular, the corresponding constraints in softly broken supersymmetric
QCD suggest non-trivial low energy mass pattern, in full accord with the
results of direct analyses.
