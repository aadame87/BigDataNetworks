  We briefly review the nonlinear sigma model approach for the subject of
increasing interest: "two-step" phase transitions in the Gross-Neveu and the
modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models at low $N$ and condensation from pseudogap
phase in strong-coupling superconductors. Recent success in describing
"Bose-type" superconductors that possess two characterstic temperatures and a
pseudogap above $T_c$ is the development approximately comparable with the BCS
theory. One can expect that it should have influence on high-energy physics,
similar to impact of the BCS theory on this subject. Although first
generalizations of this concept to particle physics were made recently, these
results were not systematized. In this review we summarize this development and
discuss similarities and differences of the appearence of the pseudogap phase
in superconductors and the Gross-Neveu and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio - like models. We
discuss its possible relevance for chiral phase transition in QCD and color
superconductors. This paper is organized in three parts: in the first section
we briefly review the separation of temperatures of pair formation and pair
condensation in strong - coupling and low carrier density superconductors (i.e.
the formation of the {\it pseudogap phase}).
  Second part is a review of nonlinear sigma model approach to an analogous
phenomenon in the Chiral Gross-Neveu model at small N. In the third section we
discuss the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model where the chiral phase transition
is accompanied by a formation of a phase analogous to the pseudogap phase.
