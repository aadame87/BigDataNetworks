  We calculate from M-theory the two-dimensional low energy effective dynamics
of various brane configurations. In the first part we study configurations that
have a dual description in type IIA string theory as two-dimensional (4,0)
Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N_1)xSU(N_2) and chiral fermions in the
bi-fundamental representation. In the second part we derive related equations
of motion which describe the low energy internal dynamics of a supersymmetric
black hole in four-dimensional N=1 supergravity, obtained as an M-fivebrane
wrapped on a complex four-cycle.
