  We propose a mechanism to break the translational invariance of compactified
space spontaneously. As a simple model, we study a real $\phi^4$ model
compactified on $M^{D-1}\otimes S^1$ in detail, where we impose a nontrivial
boundary condition on $\phi$ for the $S^1$-direction. It is shown that the
translational invariance for the $S^1$-direction is spontaneously broken when
the radius $R$ of $S^1$ becomes larger than a critical radius $R^*$ and also
that the model behaves like a $\phi^4$ model on a single kink background for $R
\to \infty$. It is pointed out that spontaneous breakdown of translational
invariance is accompanied by that of some global symmetries, in general, in our
mechanism.
