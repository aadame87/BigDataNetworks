  The quantum mechanics and thermodynamics of SU(2) non-Abelian Chern-Simons
particles (non-Abelian anyons) in an external magnetic field are addressed. We
derive the N-body Hamiltonian in the (anti-)holomorphic gauge when the Hilbert
space is projected onto the lowest Landau level of the magnetic field. In the
presence of an additional harmonic potential, the N-body spectrum depends
linearly on the coupling (statistics) parameter. We calculate the second virial
coefficient and find that in the strong magnetic field limit it develops a
step-wise behavior as a function of the statistics parameter, in contrast to
the linear dependence in the case of Abelian anyons. For small enough values of
the statistics parameter we relate the N-body partition functions in the lowest
Landau level to those of SU(2) bosons and find that the cluster (and virial)
coefficients dependence on the statistics parameter cancels.
