  The one-loop four-graviton amplitude in either of the type II superstring
theories is expanded in powers of the external momenta up to and including
terms of order s^4 log s R^4, where R^4 denotes a specific contraction of four
linearized Weyl tensors and s is a Mandelstam invariant. Terms in this series
are obtained by integrating powers of the two-dimensional scalar field theory
propagator over the toroidal world-sheet as well as the moduli of the torus.
The values of these coefficients match expectations based on duality relations
between string theory and eleven-dimensional supergravity.
