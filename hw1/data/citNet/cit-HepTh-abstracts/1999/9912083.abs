  We find the most general low energy dynamics of 1/2 BPS monopoles in the N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories (SYM) when all six adjoint Higgs expectation
values are turned on. When only one Higgs is turned on, the Lagrangian is
purely kinetic. When all six are turned on, however, this moduli space dynamics
is augmented by five independent potential terms, each in the form of half the
squared norm of a Killing vector field on the moduli space. A generic
stationary configuration of the monopoles can be interpreted as stable non BPS
dyons, previously found as non-planar string webs connecting D3-branes. The
supersymmetric extension is also found explicitly, and gives the complete
quantum mechanics of monopoles in N=4 SYM theory. We explore its supersymmetry
algebra.
