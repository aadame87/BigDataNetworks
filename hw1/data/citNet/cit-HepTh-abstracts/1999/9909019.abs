  I discuss and extend the recent proposal of Leclair and Mussardo for finite
temperature correlation functions in integrable QFTs. I give further
justification for its validity in the case of one point functions of conserved
quantities. I also argue that the proposal is not correct for two (and higher)
point functions, and give some counterexamples to justify that claim.
