  Recently D. Buchholz and R. Verch have proposed a method for implementing in
algebraic quantum field theory ideas from renormalization group analysis of
short-distance (high energy) behavior by passing to certain scaling limit
theories. Buchholz and Verch distinguish between different types of theories
where the limit is unique, degenerate, or classical, and the method allows in
principle to extract the `ultraparticle' content of a given model, i.e. to
identify particles (like quarks and gluons) that are not visible at finite
distances due to `confinement'. It is therefore of great importance for the
physical interpretation of the theory. The method has been illustrated in a
simple model in with some rather surprising results.
  This paper will focus on the question how the short distance behavior of
models defined by euclidean means is reflected in the corresponding behavior of
their Minkowski counterparts. More specifically, we shall prove that if a
euclidean theory has some short distance limit, then it is possible to pass
from this limit theory to a theory on Minkowski space, which is a short
distance limit of the Minkowski space theory corresponding to the original
euclidean theory.
