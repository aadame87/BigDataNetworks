  We establish a direct correspondence between certain higher-rank p-form
Chern-Simons topological type theories in the bulk of a manifold with boundary
and particular sectors of supergravity models on the boundary, provided that
certain boundary conditions are satisfied. The cases we investigate include
eleven-dimensional supergravity and both of the type II theories in ten
dimensions.
