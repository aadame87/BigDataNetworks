  We examine supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories on R^3*S^1 with a circle of
circumference beta. These theories interpolate between four-dimensional N=1
pure gauge theory for beta=infinity and three-dimensional N=2 gauge theory for
beta=0. The dominant field configurations of the R^3*S^1 SU(N) theories in the
semi-classical regime arise from N varieties of monopole. Periodic instanton
configurations correspond to mixed configurations of N single monopoles of the
N different types. We semi-classically evaluate the non-perturbatively
generated superpotential of the R^3*S^1 theory and hence determine its vacuum
structure. We then calculate monopole contributions to the gluino condensate in
these theories and take the decompactification limit beta=infinity. In this way
we obtain a value for the gluino condensate in the four-dimensional N=1
supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, which agrees with the previously known
`weak coupling' expression but not with the `strong coupling' expression
derived in the early literature solely from instanton considerations. Moreover,
we discover that the superpotential gives a mass to the dual (magnetic) photon,
which implies confinement of the original electric photon and disappearance of
all the massless modes.
