  We discuss the functional representation of fermions, and obtain exact
expressions for wave-functionals of the Schwinger model. Known features of the
model such as bosonization and the vacuum angle arise naturally. Contrary to
expectations, the vacuum wave-functional does not simplify at large distances,
but it may be reconstructed as a large time limit of the corresponding
Schrodinger functional, which has an expansion in local terms. The functional
Schrodinger equation reduces to a set of algebraic equations for the
coefficients of these terms. These ideas generalize to a numerical approach to
QCD in higher dimensions.
