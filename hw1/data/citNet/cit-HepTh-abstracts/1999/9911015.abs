  We consider an exotic `compactification' of spacetime in which there are two
infinite extra dimensions, using a global string instead of a domain wall. By
having a negative cosmological constant we prove the existence of a nonsingular
static solution using a dynamical systems argument. A nonsingular solution also
exists in the absence of a cosmological constant with a time-dependent metric.
We compare and contrast this solution with the Randall-Sundrum universe and the
Cohen-Kaplan spacetime, and consider the options of using such a model as a
realistic resolution of the hierarchy problem.
