  I discuss some issues of perturbative quantum gravity, namely of a theory of
self-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge fields, the gravitons, on flat
space-time, in the framework of causal perturbation theory. The central aspects
of this approach lie in the construction of the scattering matrix by means of
causality and Poincare covariance and in the analysis of the gauge structure of
the theory. For this purpose, two main tools will be used: the Epstein-Glaser
inductive and causal construction of the perturbation series for the scattering
matrix and the concept of perturbative operator quantum gauge invariance
borrowed from non-Abelian quantum gauge theories. The first method deals with
the ultraviolet problem of quantum gravity and the second one ensures gauge
invariance at the quantum level, formulated by means of a gauge charge, in each
order of perturbation theory. The gauge charge leads to a characterization of
the physical subspace of the graviton Fock space. Aspects of quantum gravity
coupled to scalar matter fields are also discussed.
