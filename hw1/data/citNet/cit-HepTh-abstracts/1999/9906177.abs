  Following the Papapetrou-Dixon-Wald procedure we derive the equation of
motion for a dilatonic test body(probe) with the dilaton coupling $\alpha =
{\sqrt {p/(2+p)}}$ in four dimension. Since the dilatonic freedom sometimes
comes from extra dimensions, it is best to derive the EOM by a dimensional
reduction from $(p+4)-$dimensions. We discuss about the force balance up to the
gravitational spin-spin interactions via the probe technique. The force balance
condition yields the saturation of a Bogomol'nyi bound and the gyromagnetic
ratio of the test body.
