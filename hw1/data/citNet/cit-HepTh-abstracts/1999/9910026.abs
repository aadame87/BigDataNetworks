  We study the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for a one-parameter quantum
field theory recently introduced by V.A.Fateev. The presence of chemical
potentials produces a kink condensate that modifies the excitation spectrum.
For some combinations of the chemical potentials an additional gapless mode
appears. Various energy scales emerge in the problem. An effective field
theory, describing the low energy excitations, is also introduced.
