  Certain exact results in supersymmetric gauge theories are generated by
non-perturbative effects different from instantons. In supersymmetric QCD with
N colours and Nf fundamental flavours we examine the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg (ADS)
superpotential using controlled semi-classical analysis. We show how for Nf <
N-1 the ADS superpotential arises from monopole contributions to the path
integral of the supersymmetric gauge theory compactified on R^3*S^1. These are
the monopole effects leading to gaugino condensation and confinement of the
low-energy SU(N-Nf) supersymmetric gauge theory.
