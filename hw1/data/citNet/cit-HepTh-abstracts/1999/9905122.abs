  We calculate gaugino masses in string-derived models with hidden-sector
gaugino condensation. The linear multiplet formulation for the dilaton
superfield is used to implement perturbative modular invariance. The
contribution arising from quantum effects in the observable sector includes the
term recently found in generic supergravity models. A much larger contribution
is present if matter fields with Standard Model gauge couplings also couple to
the Green-Schwarz counter term. We comment on the relation of our K\"ahler U(1)
superspace formalism to other calculations.
