  Starting from the Fierz transform of the two-flavour 't Hooft interaction (a
four-fermion Lagrangian with antisymmetric Lorentz tensor interaction terms
augmented by an NJL type Lorentz scalar inetraction responsible for dynamical
symmetry breaking and quark mass generation), we show that: (1) antisymmetric
tensor Nambu-Goldstone bosons appear provided that the scalar and tensor
couplings stand in the proportion of two to one, which ratio appears naturally
in the Fierz transform of the two-flavour 't Hooft interaction; (2) non-Abelian
vector gauge bosons coupled to this system acquire a non-zero mass.
Axial-vector fields do not mix with antisymmetric tensor fields, so there is no
mass shift there.
