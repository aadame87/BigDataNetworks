  We develop the general theory of Noether symmetries for constrained systems.
In our derivation, the Dirac bracket structure with respect to the primary
constraints appears naturally and plays an important role in the
characterization of the conserved quantities associated to these Noether
symmetries. The issue of projectability of these symmetries from tangent space
to phase space is fully analyzed, and we give a geometrical interpretation of
the projectability conditions in terms of a relation between the Noether
conserved quantity in tangent space and the presymplectic form defined on it.
We also examine the enlarged formalism that results from taking the Lagrange
multipliers as new dynamical variables; we find the equation that characterizes
the Noether symmetries in this formalism. The algebra of generators for Noether
symmetries is discussed in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms. We
find that a frequent source for the appearance of open algebras is the fact
that the transformations of momenta in phase space and tangent space only
coincide on shell. Our results apply with no distinction to rigid and gauge
symmetries; for the latter case we give a general proof of existence of Noether
gauge symmetries for theories with first and second class constraints that do
not exhibit tertiary constraints in the stabilization algorithm. Among some
examples that illustrate our results, we study the Noether gauge symmetries of
the Abelian Chern-Simons theory in $2n+1$ dimensions. An interesting feature of
this example is that its primary constraints can only be identified after the
determination of the secondary constraint. The example is worked out retaining
all the original set of variables.
