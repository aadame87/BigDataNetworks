  We demonstrate that QCD gluon amplitudes can be used to construct a
Lagrangian for gravity. This procedure makes use of perturbative `squaring'
relations between gravity and gauge theory that follow from string theory. We
explicitly carry out the construction for up to five-point interactions and
discuss a set of field variables in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian for
interpreting the Lagrangian obtained from QCD. A spin-off from our analysis is
that it can be used to provide simpler tree-level gravity Feynman rules than
for conventional gauges.
