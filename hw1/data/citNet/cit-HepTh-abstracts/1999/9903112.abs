  It is shown that noncommutative geometry is a nonperturbative regulator which
can manifestly preserve a space supersymmetry and a supergauge symmetry while
keeping only a finite number of degrees of freedom in a theory. The simplest
N=1 case of an U(1) supergauge theory on the sphere is worked out in detail.
