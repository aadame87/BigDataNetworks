  It has been conjectured that at a stationary point of the tachyon potential
for the D-brane of bosonic string theory, the negative energy density exactly
cancels the D-brane tension. We evaluate this tachyon potential by off-shell
calculations in open string field theory. Surprisingly, the condensation of the
tachyon mode alone into the stationary point of its cubic potential is found to
cancel about 70% of the D-brane tension. Keeping relevant scalars up to four
mass levels above the tachyon, the energy density at the shifted stationary
point cancels 99% of the D-brane tension.
