  In the context of the free-fermionic formulation of the heterotic
superstring, we construct a three generation N=1 supersymmetric
SU(4)xSU(2)LxSU(2)R model supplemented by an SU(8) hidden gauge symmetry and
five Abelian factors. The symmetry breaking to the standard model is achieved
using vacuum expectation values of a Higgs pair in (4bar,2R)+(4,2R) at a high
scale. One linear combination of the Abelian symmetries is anomalous and is
broken by vacuum expectation values of singlet fields along the flat directions
of the superpotential. All consistent string vacua of the model are completely
classified by solving the corresponding system of F- and D-flatness equations
including non-renormalizable terms up to sixth order. The requirement of
existence of electroweak massless doublets further restricts the
phenomenologically viable vacua. The third generation fermions receive masses
from the tree-level superpotential. Further, a complete calculation of all
non-renormalizable fermion mass terms up to fifth order shows that in certain
string vacua the hierarchy of the fermion families is naturally obtained in the
model as the second and third generation fermions earn their mass from fourth
and fifth order terms. Along certain flat directions it is shown that the ratio
of the SU(4) breaking scale and the reduced Planck mass is equal to the up
quark ratio m_c/m_t at the string scale. An additional prediction of the model,
is the existence of a U(1) symmetry carried by the fields of the hidden sector,
ensuring thus the stability of the lightest hidden state. It is proposed that
the hidden states may account for the invisible matter of the universe.
