  We study quantum dilaton coupled spinors in two and four dimensions. Making
classical transformation of metric, dilaton coupled spinor theory is
transformed to minimal spinor theory with another metric and in case of 4d
spinor also in the background of the non-trivial vector field. This gives the
possibility to calculate 2d and 4d dilaton dependent conformal (or Weyl)
anomaly in easy way. Anomaly induced effective action for such spinors is
derived. In case of 2d, the effective action reproduces, without any extra
terms, the term added by hands in the quantum correction for RST model, which
is exactly solvable. For 4d spinor the chiral anomaly which depends explicitly
from dilaton is also found. As some application we discuss SUSY Black Holes in
dilatonic supergravity with WZ type matter and Hawking radiation in the same
theory. As another application we investigate spherically reduced Einstein
gravity with 2d dilaton coupled fermion anomaly induced effective action and
show the existence of quantum corrected Schwarszchild-de Sitter (SdS) (Nariai)
BH with multiple horizon.
