  As superstring solitons that carry Neuveu-Schwarz charge can be described in
terms of gerbes, one expects non-Abelian gerbes to appear e.g. in the exotic
six-dimensional world-volume theories of coinciding NS5 branes. We consider
open bosonic strings on a space-time that is branched in such a way that the
B-field is provided with the same Lie algebra structure as the world-volume
gauge field on a D-brane. These considerations motivate a generalization of the
cocycle conditions and the transformation rules of an Abelian gerbe in
hypercohomology. The resulting system incorporates in a natural way the NS
two-form, the RR gauge field, the Chan-Paton gauge field, the relevant gauge
transformations and the holonomies associated to Wilson surface observables.
