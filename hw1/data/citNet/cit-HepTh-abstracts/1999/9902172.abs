  The fields nonlinear modes quantization scheme is discussed. New form of the
perturbation theory achieved by unitary mapping the quantum dynamics in the
space $W_G$ of (action, angle)-type collective variables. It is shown why the
transformed perturbation theory contributions may accumulated exactly on the
boundary $\pa W_G$. Abilities of the developed formalism are illustrated by
examples from quantum mechanics and field theory.
