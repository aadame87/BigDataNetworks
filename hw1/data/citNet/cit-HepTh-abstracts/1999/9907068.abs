  We study the Lund-Regge equation that governs the motion of strings in a
constant background antisymmetric tensor field by using the duality between the
Lund-Regge equation and the complex sine-Gordon equation. Similar to the cases
of vortex filament configurations in fluid dynamics, we find various exact
solitonic string configurations which are the analogue of the Kelvin wave, the
Hasimoto soliton and the smoke ring. In particular, using the duality relation,
we obtain a completely new type of configuration which corresponds to the
breather of the complex sine-Gordon equation.
