  Recently, a number of authors have challenged the conventional assumption
that the string scale, Planck mass, and unification scale are roughly
comparable. It has been suggested that the string scale could be as low as a
TeV. The greatest obstacle to developing a string phenomenology is our lack of
understanding of the ground state. We explain why the dynamics which determines
this state is not likely to be accessible to any systematic approximation. We
note that the racetrack scheme, often cited as a counterexample, suffers from
similar difficulties. We stress that the weakness of the gauge couplings, the
gauge hierarchy, and coupling unification suggest that it may be possible to
extract some information in a systematic approximation. We review the ideas of
Kahler stabilization, an attempt to reconcile these facts. We consider whether
the system is likely to sit at extremes of the moduli space, as in recent
proposals for a low string scale. Finally we discuss the idea of Maximally
Enhanced Symmetry, a hypothesis which is technically natural, compatible with
basic facts about cosmology, and potentially predictive.
