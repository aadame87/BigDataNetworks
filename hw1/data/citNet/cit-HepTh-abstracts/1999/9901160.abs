  We consider a model for tensionless (null) super p-branes with N chiral
supersymmetries in ten dimensional flat space-time. After establishing the
symmetries of the action, we give the general solution of the classical
equations of motion in a particular gauge. In the case of a null superstring
(p=1) we find the general solution in an arbitrary gauge. Then, using a
harmonic superspace approach, the initial algebra of first and second class
constraints is converted into an algebra of Lorentz-covariant, BFV-irreducible,
first class constraints only. The corresponding BRST charge is as for a first
rank dynamical system.
