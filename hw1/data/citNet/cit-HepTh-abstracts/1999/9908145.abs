Title: Ultra-Relativistic Hamiltonian with Various Singular Potentials
Authors: Atsushi Yoshida
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  It is shown from a simple scaling invariance that the ultra-relativistic
Hamiltonian (mu=0) does not have bound states when the potential is Coulombic.
This supplements the application of the relativistic virial theorem derived by
Lucha and Schoeberl which shows that bound states do not exist for potentials
more singular than the Coulomb potential.
