  A complete derivation, from first principles, of the reaction-rate formula
for a generic reaction taking place in an out of equilibrium quantum-field
system is given. It is shown that the formula involves no finite-volume
correction. Each term of the reaction-rate formula represents a set of physical
processes that contribute to the reaction under consideration.
