  We study brane configurations that give rise to large-N gauge theories with
eight supersymmetries and no hypermultiplets. These configurations include a
variety of wrapped, fractional, and stretched branes or strings. The
corresponding spacetime geometries which we study have a distinct kind of
singularity known as a repulson. We find that this singularity is removed by a
distinctive mechanism, leaving a smooth geometry with a core having an enhanced
gauge symmetry. The spacetime geometry can be related to large-N Seiberg-Witten
theory.
