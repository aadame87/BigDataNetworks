  It is shown that certain extremal correlators in four-dimensional N=2
superconformal field theories (including N=4 super-Yang-Mills as a special
case) have a free-field functional form. It is further argued that the coupling
constant dependence receives no correction beyond the lowest order. These
results hold for any finite value of N_c.
