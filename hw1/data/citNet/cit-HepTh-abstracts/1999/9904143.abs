  An AdS_2 black hole spacetime is an AdS_2 spacetime together with a preferred
choice of time. The Boulware, Hartle-Hawking and SL(2,R) invariant vacua are
constructed, together with their Green functions and stress tensors, for both
massive and massless scalars in an AdS_2 black hole. The classical
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is found to be independent of the temperature, but
at one loop a non-zero entanglement entropy arises. This represents a
logarithmic violation of finite-temperature decoupling for AdS_2 black holes
which arise in the near-horizon limit of an asymptotically flat black hole.
Correlation functions of the SL(2,R) invariant boundary quantum mechanics are
computed as functions of the choice of AdS_2 vacuum.
