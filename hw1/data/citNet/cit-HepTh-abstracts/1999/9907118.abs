  The two different approaches - K\"{a}llen's and Brandt's methods - for the
calculations of the Schwinger terms in the 1+1 dimensional Abelian and
non-Abelian free current algebras are discussed. These methods are applied to
calculation of the single and double commutators. The validity of the Jacobi
identities is examined in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions and in this way is given
natural restriction on the regularization. It is shown that the Jacobi identity
cannot be broken in 1+1 dimensions even using the regularization which fails in
the 3+1 dimensional case. A connection between the Schwinger term and anomaly
is shown in the simplest case of the Schwinger model.
