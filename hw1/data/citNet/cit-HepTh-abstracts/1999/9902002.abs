  We evaluate the fermionic determinant for massless QED_2 at finite
temperature, in the imaginary time formalism. By using a decoupling
transformation of the fermionic fields, we show that the determinant factorizes
into the usual, temperature independent expression, times an extra factor which
depends on the temperature and on the constant component of the gauge field.
