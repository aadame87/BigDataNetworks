  A new method is discussed which vastly simplifies one of the two integrals
over AdS(d+1) required to compute exchange graphs for 4-point functions of
scalars in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The explicit form of the bulk-to-bulk
propagator is not required. Previous results for scalar, gauge boson and
graviton exchange are reproduced, and new results are given for massive
vectors. It is found that precisely for the cases that occur in the AdS(5) X
S(5) compactification of Type IIB supergravity, the exchange diagrams reduce to
a finite sum of graphs with quartic scalar vertices. The analogous integrals in
n-point scalar diagrams for n>4 are also evaluated.
