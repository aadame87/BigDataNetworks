  We consider domain walls embedded in curved backgrounds as an approximation
for braneworld scenarios. We give a large class of new exact solutions,
exhausting the possibilities for describing one and two walls for the cases
where the curvature of both the bulk and the wall is locally constant. In the
case of two walls, we find solutions where each wall has positive tension. An
interesting property of these solutions is that the curvature of the walls can
be much smaller than the tension, leading to a significant cancellation of the
effective cosmological constant, which however is still much larger than the
observational limits. We further discuss some aspects of inflation in models
based on wall solutions.
