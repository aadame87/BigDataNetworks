  In this paper we construct explicitly an infinite number of Hopfions (static,
soliton solutions with non-zero Hopf topological charges) within the recently
proposed 3+1-dimensional, integrable and relativistically invariant field
theory. Two integers label the family of Hopfions we have found. Their product
is equal to the Hopf charge which provides a lower bound to the soliton's
finite energy. The Hopfions are constructed explicitly in terms of the toroidal
coordinates and shown to have a form of linked closed vortices.
