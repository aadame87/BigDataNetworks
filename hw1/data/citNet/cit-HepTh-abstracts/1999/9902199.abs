  The two-dimensional chiral anomaly is calculated using differential
regularization. It is shown that the anomaly emerges naturally in the vector
and axial Ward identities on the same footing as the four-dimensional case. The
vector gauge symmetry can be achieved by an appropriate choice of the mass
scales without introducing the seagull term. We have analyzed the reason why
such a universal result can be obtained in differential regularization.
