  We calculate the classical cross-section for absorption of a minimally
coupled scalar in the double-centered D3-brane geometry. The dual field theory
has gauge symmetry broken to S(U(N_1)*U(N_2)) and is on the Coulomb branch of
N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory. Our analysis is valid at energy scales much
smaller than the W particles mass, giving logarithmic corrections to the cross
section calculated at the IR conformal fixed points. These corrections are
associated with deformations of the N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory by irrelevant
operators that break conformal invariance and correspond to processes where a
virtual pair of gauge particles or a virtual pair of W bosons interact with the
incident wave to create a pair of gauge particles.
