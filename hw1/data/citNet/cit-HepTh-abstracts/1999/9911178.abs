  Extending previous work on $a_2^{(1)}$, we present a set of reflection
matrices, which are explicit solutions to the $a_n^{(1)}$ boundary Yang-Baxter
equation. Unlike solutions found previously these are multiplet-changing
$K$-matrices, and could therefore be used as soliton reflection matrices for
affine Toda field theories on the half-line.
