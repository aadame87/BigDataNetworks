  The free energy of a field theory can be considered as a functional of the
free correlation function. As such it obeys a nonlinear functional differential
equation which can be turned into a recursion relation. This is solved order by
order in the coupling constant to find all connected vacuum diagrams with their
proper multiplicities. The procedure is applied to a multicomponent scalar
field theory with a phi^4-self-interaction and then to a theory of two scalar
fields phi and A with an interaction phi^2 A. All Feynman diagrams with
external lines are obtained from functional derivatives of the connected vacuum
diagrams with respect to the free correlation function. Finally, the recursive
graphical construction is automatized by computer algebra with the help of a
unique matrix notation for the Feynman diagrams.
