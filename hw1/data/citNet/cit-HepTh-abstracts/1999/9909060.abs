  We show that correlation functions for branched polymers correspond to those
for $\phi^3$ theory with a single mass insertion, not those for the $\phi^3$
theory themselves, as has been widely believed. In particular, the two-point
function behaves as 1/p^4, not as 1/p^2. This behavior is consistent with the
fact that the Hausdorff dimension of the branched polymer is four.
