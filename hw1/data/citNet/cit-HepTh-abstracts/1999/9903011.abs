Title: Some Aspects of Quantum Gravity in the Causal Approach
Authors: Nicola Grillo (Institute for Theoretical Physics, Zurich University)
Comments: 7 pages, latex, no figures

\\
  We describe the construction of quantum gravity, i.e. of a theory of
self-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge fields, the gravitons, on flat
space-time, in the framework of causal perturbation theory.
