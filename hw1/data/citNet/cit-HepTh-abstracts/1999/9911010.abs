  We study massless and massive Hawking radiations on a two-dimensional AdS
spacetime. For the massless case, the quantum stress-energy tensor of a
massless scalar field on the AdS background is calculated, and the expected
null radiation is obtained. However, for the massive case, the scattering
analysis is performed in order to calculate the absorption and reflection
coefficients which are related to statistical Hawking temperature. On the
contrary to the massless case, we obtain a nonvanishing massive radiation.
