  It has been conjectured that Little String Theories in six dimensions are
holographic to critical string theory in a linear dilaton background. We test
this conjecture for theories arising on the worldvolume of heterotic
fivebranes. We compute the spectrum of chiral primaries in these theories and
compare with results following from Type I-heterotic duality and the AdS/CFT
correspondence. We also construct holographic duals for heterotic fivebranes
near orbifold singularities. Finally we find several new Little String Theories
which have Spin(32)/Z_2 or E_8 \times E_8 global symmetry but do not have a
simple interpretation either in heterotic or M-theory.
