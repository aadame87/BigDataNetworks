  In the 't Hooft-Veltman dimensional regularization scheme it is necessary to
introduce finite counterterms to satisfy chiral Ward identities. It is a
non-trivial task to evaluate these counterterms even at two loops. We suggest
the use of Wilsonian exact renormalization group techniques to reduce the
computation of these counterterms to simple master integrals. We illustrate
this method by a detailed study of a generic Yukawa model with massless
fermions at two loops.
