  According to the holographic principle all information in the bulk of a space
is coded at its border. We will check this statement in three situations
involving the AdS/CFT correspondence. There is a well known equivalence between
the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and the self-dual model in 3 dimensions when
the parameters of both theories are related in a given way. We will show that
when this relation holds the corresponding CFT's at the border are the same.
Then we will study scalar fields. There are two quantum theories for the scalar
field in AdS space. The usual prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence which
takes Dirichlet boundary conditions at the border corresponds to one of the
quantum theories. We will show that changing boundary conditions will allow us
to get the other quantum theory. Finally we consider an Abelian gauge theory in
AdS. We will show that the corresponding CFT is independent of the gauge choice
and that the gauge dependence stays only in the contact terms at the border.
