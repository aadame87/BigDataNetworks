  The Chern-Simons formulation of $AdS_3$ supergravity is considered.
Asymptotic conditions on the Rarita-Schwinger fields are given. Together with
the known boundary conditions on the bosonic fields, these ensure that the
asymptotic algebra is the superconformal algebra, with the same central charge
as the one of pure gravity. It is also indicated that the asymptotic dynamics
is described by super-Liouville.
