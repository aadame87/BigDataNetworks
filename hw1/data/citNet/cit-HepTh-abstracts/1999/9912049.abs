  We show how non-near horizon p-brane theories can be obtained from two
embedding constraints in a flat higher dimensional space with 2 time
directions. In particular this includes the construction of D3 branes from a
flat 12-dimensional action, and M2 and M5 branes from 13 dimensions. The
worldvolume actions are determined by constant forms in the higher dimension,
reduced to the usual expressions by Lagrange multipliers. The formulation
affords insight in the global aspects of the spacetime geometries and makes
contact with recent work on two-time physics.
