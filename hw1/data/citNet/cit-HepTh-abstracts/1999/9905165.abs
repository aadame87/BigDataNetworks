  We consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric QCD with Nf < Nc
massive flavours. In particular, for 2 Nf < Nc we explicitly construct the
domain walls that interpolate between vacua labeled by i and (i+ N_f). We show
that these solutions are Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) saturated for any
value of the mass of the matter fields. This fact allows us to evaluate the
large mass limit of these domain walls. We comment on the relevance of these
solutions for supersymmetric gluodynamics.
