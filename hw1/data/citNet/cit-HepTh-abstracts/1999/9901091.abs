  We use toric geometry to investigate the recently proposed relation between a
set of D3 branes at a generalized conifold singularity and type IIA
configurations of D4 branes stretched between a number of relatively rotated
NS5 branes. In particular we investigate how various resolutions of the
singularity corresponds to moving the NS branes and how Seiberg's duality is
realized when two relatively rotated NS-branes are interchanged.
