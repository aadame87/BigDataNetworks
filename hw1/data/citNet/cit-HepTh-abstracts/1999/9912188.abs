  D-branes on one-parameter Calabi-Yau spaces and two-parameter K3-fibered
Calabi-Yau manifolds are analyzed from both the Gepner model point of view and
the geometric perspective. We compute part of the spectrum of the boundary
states and comment on the appearance of the D0-brane as well as on
nonsupersymmetric large volume configurations becoming supersymmetric at the
Gepner point.
