  The use of proper time as a tool for causality implementation in field theory
is clarified and extended to allow a manifestly covariant definition of
discrete fields proper to be applied in field theory and quantum mechanics. It
implies on a constraint between a radiation field and its sources, valid in
principle for all fundamental interactions and with a solid experimental
confirmation for the electromagnetic one. Some results of its applications to
an abelian classical theory (electrodynamics taken as a first example), and
with the discrete field being regarded as a classical representation of the
field quantum (photon) are anticipated in order to illuminate the physical
meaning and the origins of gauge fields and of their symmetries and
singularities. They are associated to a loss of field-source coherence.
