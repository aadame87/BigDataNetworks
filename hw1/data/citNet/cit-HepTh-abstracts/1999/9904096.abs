  We present a direct field theoretical calculation of the consistent gauge
anomaly in the superfield formalism, on the basis of a definition of the
effective action through the covariant gauge current. The scheme is
conceptually and technically simple and the gauge covariance in intermediate
steps reduces calculational labors considerably. The resultant superfield
anomaly, being proportional to the anomaly $d^{abc}=\tr T^a\{T^b,T^c\}$, is
minimal without supplementing any counterterms. Our anomaly coincides with the
anomaly obtained by Marinkovi\'c as the solution of the Wess-Zumino consistency
condition.
