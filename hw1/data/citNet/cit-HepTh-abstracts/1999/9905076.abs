  The one-loop renormalization of a general chiral gauge theory without scalar
and Majorana fields is fully worked out within Breitenlohner and Maison
dimensional renormalization scheme. The coefficients of the anomalous terms
introduced in the Slavnov-Taylor equations by the minimal subtraction algorithm
are calculated and the asymmetric counterterms needed to restore the BRS
symmetry, if the anomaly cancellation conditions are met, are computed. The
renormalization group equation and its coefficients are worked out in the
anomaly free case. The computations draw heavily from the existence of action
principles and BRS cohomology theory.
