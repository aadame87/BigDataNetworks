  We consider Chern-Simons gauged nonlinear sigma model with boundary which has
a manifest bulk diffeomorphism invariance. We find that the Gauss's law can be
solved explicitly when the nonlinear sigma model is defined on the Hermitian
symmetric space, and the original bulk theory completely reduces to a boundary
nonlinear sigma model with the target space of Hermitian symmetric space. We
also study the symplectic structure, compute the diffeomorphism algebra on the
boundary, and find an (enlarged) Virasoro algebra with classical central term.
