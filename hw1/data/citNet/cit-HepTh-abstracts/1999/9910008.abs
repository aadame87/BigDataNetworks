  We re-examine Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) with massless electron as a
finite quantum field theory as advocated by Gell-Mann-Low, Baker-Johnson,
Adler, Jackiw and others. We analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation satisfied by
the massless electron in finite QED and conclude that the theory admits no
nontrivial eigenvalue for the fine structure constant.
