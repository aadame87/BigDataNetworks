  We compute part of the superfield in terms of the component fields of
11-dimensional on-shell supergravity by using `Gauge completion' in 2nd-order
formalism. The result is the same as was derived recently in 1.5-order
formalism by B. de Wit, K. Peeters and J. Plefka. We use 2nd-order formalism
because in order to hold $\kappa $-invariance generally 2nd-order formalism is
more hopeful and simpler than 1.5-order formalism.
