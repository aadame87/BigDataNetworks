  It is found that the 2-index potential in nonabelian theories does not behave
geometrically as a connection but that, considered as an element of the second
de Rham cohomology group twisted by a flat connection, it fits well with all
the properties assigned to it in various physical contexts. We also prove some
results on the Euler characteristic of the twisted de Rham complex. Finally,
provided that some conditions are satisfied, we propose a non-Abelian
generalisation of S-duality.
