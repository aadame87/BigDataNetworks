  We relate various black hole solutions in the near-horizon region to black
hole solutions in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories in order to argue
that thermodynamics of black holes in D>=4 can be effectively described by
thermodynamics of black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. We
show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies of single-charged dilatonic black
holes and dilatonic p-branes with an arbitrary dilaton coupling parameter in
arbitrary spacetime dimensions are exactly reproduced by the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy of the two-dimensional black hole in the associated two-dimensional
dilaton gravity model. We comment that thermodynamics of non-extreme stringy
four-dimensional black hole with four charges and five-dimensional black hole
with three charges may be effectively described by thermodynamics of the black
hole solutions with constant dilaton field in two-dimensional dilaton gravity
theories.
