  In this note, we review various seemingly different ways of obtaining
Eguchi-Hanson metric with or without a cosmological constant term.
Interestingly, the conformal class of metric corresponding to hyperbolic
$n$-monopole solution obtained from the generalized Gibbons-Hawking ansatz,
reduces to the Eguchi-Hanson metric in a particular limit. These results,
though known from an algebraic geometry point of view, are useful while dealing
with rotational killing symmetry of self-dual metrics in general theory of
relativity as well as in the context of duality symmetry in string theory.
