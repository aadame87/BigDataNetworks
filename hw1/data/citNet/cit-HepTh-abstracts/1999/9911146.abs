  We present a general description of two mixed branes interactions. For this
we consider two mixed branes with dimensions p_1 and p_2, in external field
B_{\mu\nu} and arbitrary gauge fields A^1_{\alpha_1} and A^2_{\alpha_2} on the
world volume of them, in spacetime in which some of its directions are
compactified on circles with different radii. Some examples are considered to
clear these general interactions. Finally contribution of the massless states
on the interactions is extracted. Closed string with mixed boundary conditions
and boundary state formalism, provide useful tools for calculation of these
interactions.
