  The three-phase version of the hybrid chiral bag model, containing the phase
of asymptotic freedom, the hadronization phase as well as the intermediate
phase of constituent quarks, is proposed. For this model the self-consistent
solution, which takes into account the fermion vacuum polarization effects, is
found in (1+1) D. Within this solution the total energy of the bag, including
the one-loop contribution from the Dirac's sea, is studied as the function of
the bag geometry under condition of nonvanishing boson condensate density in
the interior region. The existence and uniqueness of the ground state bag
configuration, which minimizes the total energy and contains all the three
phases, are shown.
