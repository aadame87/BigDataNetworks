  We study the near horizon limit of a four dimensional extreme rotating black
hole. The limiting metric is a completely nonsingular vacuum solution, with an
enhanced symmetry group SL(2,R) x U(1). We show that many of the properties of
this solution are similar to the AdS_2 x S^2 geometry arising in the near
horizon limit of extreme charged black holes. In particular, the boundary at
infinity is a timelike surface. This suggests the possibility of a dual quantum
mechanical description. A five dimensional generalization is also discussed.
