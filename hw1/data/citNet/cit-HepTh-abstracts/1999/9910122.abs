  In a recent essay, we discussed the possibility of using polymer sizing to
model the collapse of a single, long excited string to a black hole. In this
letter, we apply this idea to bring further support to string/black hole
correspondence. In particular, we reproduce Horowitz and Polchinki's results
for self-gravitating fundamental strings and speculate on the nature of the
quantum degrees of freedom of black holes in string theory.
