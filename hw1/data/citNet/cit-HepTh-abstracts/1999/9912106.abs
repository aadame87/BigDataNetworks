  We consider type IIB (p,q) 5-branes in constant non-zero background tensor
potentials, or equivalently, with finite constant field strength on the brane.
At linear level, zero-modes are introduced and the physical degrees of freedom
are found to be parametrised by a real 2- or 4-form field strength on the
brane. An exact, SL(2;Z)-covariant solution to the full non-linear supergravity
equations is then constructed. The resulting metric space-times are analysed,
with special emphasis on the limiting cases with maximal values of the tensor.
The analysis provides an answer to how the various background tensor fields are
related to Born-Infeld degrees of freedom and to non-commutativity parameters.
