  An exposition of the different definitions and approaches to quantum
statistics is given, with emphasis in one-dimensional situations. Permutation
statistics, scattering statistics and exclusion statistics are analyzed. The
Calogero model, matrix model and spin chain models constitute specific
realizations.
