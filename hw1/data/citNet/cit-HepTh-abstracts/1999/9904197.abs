  The physical properties of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in
(n+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime are related, by a holographic map,
to the physics of a class of n-dimensional field theories coupled to a
background global current. Motivated by that fact, and the recent observations
of the striking similarity between the thermodynamic phase structure of these
black holes (in the canonical ensemble) and that of the van der Waals-Maxwell
liquid-gas system, we explore the physics in more detail. We study fluctuations
and stability within the equilibrium thermodynamics, examining the specific
heats and electrical permittivity of the holes, and consider the analogue of
the Clayperon equation at the phase boundaries. Consequently, we refine the
phase diagrams in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We study the
interesting physics in the neighbourhood of the critical point in the canonical
ensemble. There is a second order phase transition found there, and that region
is characterized by a Landau-Ginzburg model with A_3 potential. The
holographically dual field theories provide the description of the microscopic
degrees of freedom which underlie all of the thermodynamics, as can be seen by
examining the form of the microscopic fluctuations.
