  We derive the complete set of supersymmetric Ward identities involving only
two- and three- point proper vertices in supersymmetric QED. We also present
the most general form of the proper vertices consistent with both the
supersymmetric and U(1) gauge Ward identities. These vertices are the
supersymmetric equivalent of the non supersymmetric Ball-Chiu vertices.
