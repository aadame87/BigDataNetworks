Title: Z_2-Graded Cocycles in Higher Dimensions
Authors: C. Ekstrand

\\
  Current superalgebras and corresponding Schwinger terms in 1 and 3 space
dimensions are studied. This is done by generalizing the quantization of chiral
fermions in an external Yang-Mills potential to the case of a Z_2-graded
potential coupled to bosons and fermions.
