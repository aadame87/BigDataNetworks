  We give an explicit formulation of the three-dimensional $SL(4,R)/SO(2,2)
\sigma$-model representing the five-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to the
dilaton and the three-form field for spacetimes with two commuting Killing
vector fields. New matrix representation is obtained which is similar to one
found earlier in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA)
theory. The SL(4,R) symmetry joins a variety of 5D solutions of different
physical types including strings, 0-branes, KK monopoles etc. interpreting them
as duals to the four-dimensional Kerr metric translated along the fifth
coordinate. The symmetry transformations are used to construct new rotating
strings and composite 0-1-branes endowed with a NUT parameter.
