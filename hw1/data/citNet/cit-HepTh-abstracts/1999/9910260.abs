  Via T-duality, a stack of unwrapped type 0 NS5-branes is transformed into a
Kaluza-Klein monopole with A_n type singularity at its center. The spectrum of
twisted modes at the singularity contains tachyonic modes. We show that, in
certain parameter region, this tachyonic spectrum is completely reproduced as
modes of the bulk tachyon field localized on a classical NS5-brane solution. In
passing, we show how twisted modes at the singularity reproduce gauge fields on
stacks of NS5-branes.
