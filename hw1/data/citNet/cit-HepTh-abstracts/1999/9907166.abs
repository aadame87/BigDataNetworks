  We study the non-commutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at strong
coupling using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The supergravity description and the
UV/IR relation confirms the expectation that the non-commutativity affects the
ultra-violet but not the infra-red of the Yang-Mills dynamics. We show that the
supergravity solution dual to the non-commutative N=4 SYM in four dimensions
has no boundary and defines a minimal scale. We also show that the relation
between the B field and the scale of non-commutativity is corrected at large
coupling and determine its dependence on the 't Hooft coupling \lambda.
