  We explore all the possible ways of fixing the kappa symmetry for both branes
and strings by means of a constant projector. We find that they can be
classified according to their behaviour under Dirac conjugation and
conjugation. This latter controls the maximum power of the fermionic variables
in which the (super)vielbein can be expanded while the former determines which
states cannot be described in the gauge. In particular there exists an
interesting class of projectors for which vielbein are at most quadratic in the
fermionic variables. As an example we compute the action for the type IIb on a
AdS_{5} X S_{5} background with a lightcone-like projector; this action reduces
to the usual lightcone GS string action in the flat limit.
