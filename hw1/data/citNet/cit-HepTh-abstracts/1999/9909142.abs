  The periodic bounce configurations responsible for quantum tunneling are
obtained explicitly and are extended to the finite energy case for
minisuperspace models of the Universe. As a common feature of the tunneling
models at finite energy considered here we observe that the period of the
bounce increases with energy monotonically. The periodic bounces do not have
bifurcations and make no contribution to the nucleation rate except the one
with zero energy. The sharp first order phase transition from quantum tunneling
to thermal activation is verified with the general criterions.
