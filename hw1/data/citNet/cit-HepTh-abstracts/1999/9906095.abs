  Modifications of the area law are crucial in order to find agreement with
microscopic entropy calculations based on string theory, when including
contributions that are subleading for large charges. The deviations of the area
law are in accord with Wald's proposal for the entropy based on a Noether
charge. We discuss this for the case of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric
black holes.
