  We investigate non-Abelian gauge theories within a Wilsonian Renormalisation
Group approach. Our main question is: How close can one get to a gauge
invariant flow, despite the fact that a Wilsonian coarse-graining seems to be
incompatible with gauge invariance? We discuss the possible options in the case
of quantum fluctuations, and argue that for thermal fluctuations a fully gauge
invariant implementation can be obtained.
