  In anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, classical supergravity solutions are
represented "holographically" by conformal field theory (CFT) states in which
operators have expectation values. These 1-point functions are directly related
to the asymptotic behaviour of bulk fields. In some cases, distinct
supergravity solutions have identical asymptotic behaviour; so dual expectation
values are insufficient to distinguish them. We argue that non-local objects in
the gauge theory can resolve the ambiguity, and explicitly show that
collections of point particles in AdS_3 can be detected by studying kinks in
dual CFT Green functions. Three dimensional black holes can be formed by
collision of such particles. We show how black hole formation can be detected
in the holographic dual, and calculate CFT quantities that are sensitive to the
distribution of matter inside the event horizon.
