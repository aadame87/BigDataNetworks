  We argue that there are generic solutions to the type 0 gravity equations of
motion that are confining in the infrared and have log scaling in the
ultraviolet. The background curvature generically diverges in the IR.
Nevertheless, there exist solutions where higher order string corrections
appear to be exponentially suppressed in the IR with respect to the leading
type 0 gravity terms. For these solutions the tachyon flows to a fixed value.
 We show that the generic solutions lead to a long range linear quark
potential, magnetic screening and a discrete glueball spectrum. We also
estimate some WKB glueball mass ratios and compare them to ratios found using
finite temperature models and lattice computations.
