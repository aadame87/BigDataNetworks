  We propose a new mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The
existence of extra dimensions with nontrivial topology plays an important role.
We investigate new features resulted from the mechanism in two simple
supersymmetric Z_2 and U(1) models. One of remarkable features is that there
exists a phase in which the translational invariance for the compactified
directions is broken spontaneously, accompanying the breakdown of the
supersymmetry. The mass spectrum of the models appeared in reduced dimensions
is a full of variety, reflecting the highly nontrivial vacuum structure of the
models. The Nambu-Goldstone bosons (fermions) associated with breakdown of
symmetries are found in the mass spectrum. Our mechanism also yields quite
different vacuum structures if models have different global symmetries.
