  Boulatov and Ooguri have generalized the matrix models of 2d quantum gravity
to 3d and 4d, in the form of field theories over group manifolds. We show that
the Barrett-Crane quantum gravity model arises naturally from a theory of this
type, but restricted to the homogeneous space S^3=SO(4)/SO(3), as a term in its
Feynman expansion. From such a perspective, 4d quantum spacetime emerges as a
Feynman graph, in the manner of the 2d matrix models. This formalism provides a
precise meaning to the ``sum over triangulations'', which is presumably
necessary for a physical interpretation of a spin foam model as a theory of
gravity. In addition, this formalism leads us to introduce a natural
alternative model, which might have relevance for quantum gravity.
