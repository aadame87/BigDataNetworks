  We study the solutions of the Einstein equations in (d+2)-dimensions,
describing parallel p-branes (p=d-1) in a space with two transverse dimensions
of positive gaussian curvature. These solutions generalize the solutions of
Deser and Jackiw of point particle sources in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with
cosmological constant. Determination of the metric is reduced to finding the
roots of a simple algebraic equation. These roots also determine the nontrivial
"warp factors" of the metric at the positions of the branes. We discuss the
possible role of these solutions and the importance of "warp factors" in the
context of the large extra dimensions scenario.
