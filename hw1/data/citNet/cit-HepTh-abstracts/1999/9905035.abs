  Non-equilibrium quantum field theory studies time dependence of processes
which are not available for the S-matrix description. One of the new methods of
investigation in non-equilibrium quantum theory is the stochastic limit method.
This method is an extension of the works by Bogoliubov, van Hove and Prigogine
and it permits to study not only the system but also the reservoir degrees of
freedom. We consider the stochastic limit of translation invariant Hamiltonians
in quantum field theory and show that the master field satisfies a new type of
commutation relations, the so called entangled (or interacting) commutation
relations. These relations extend the interacting Fock relations established
earlier in non-relativistic QED and the free (or Boltzmann) commutation
relations which have been found in the large N limit of QCD. As an application
of the stochastic limit method we consider the photon splitting cascades in
magnetic field and show that photons in cascades form entangled states
("triphons") and they obey not Bose but a new type of statistics corresponding
to the entangled commutation relations.
