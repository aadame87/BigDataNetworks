  The phase diagram for Dp-branes in M-theory compactified on $T^4$, $T^4/Z_2$,
$T^5$, and $T^6$ is constructed. As for the lower-dimensional tori considered
in our previous work (hep-th/9810224), the black brane phase at high entropy
connects onto matrix theory at low entropy; we thus recover all known instances
of matrix theory as consequences of the Maldacena conjecture. The difficulties
that arise for $T^6$ are reviewed. We also analyze the D1-D5 system on $T^5$;
we exhibit its relation to matrix models of M5-branes, and use spectral flow as
a tool to investigate the dependence of the phase structure on angular
momentum.
