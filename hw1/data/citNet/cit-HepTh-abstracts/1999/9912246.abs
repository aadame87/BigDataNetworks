  A model for quantized gravitation based on the simplicial lattice
discretization is studied in detail using a comprehensive finite size scaling
analysis combined with renormalization group methods. The results are
consistent with a value for the universal critical exponent for gravitation
$\nu=1/3$, and suggest a simple relationship between Newton's constant, the
gravitational correlation length and the observable average space-time
curvature. Some perhaps testable phenomenological implications of these results
are discussed. To achieve a high numerical accuracy in the evaluation of the
lattice path integral a dedicated parallel machine was assembled.
