Title: Defect Formation Through Boson Condensation in Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Giuseppe Vitiello
Comments: Lectures given at Les-Houches Winter School "Topological Defects and
  the Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Symmetry Breaking Phase Transitions",
  February 16 - 26, 1999
\\
  Kinks, vortices, monopoles are extended objects, or defects, of quantum
origin with topologically non-trivial properties and macroscopic behavior. They
are described in Quantum Field Theory in terms of non-homogeneous boson
condensation. I will review the related QFT formalism, the spontaneous
breakdown of symmetry framework in which the defects appear and discuss finite
temperature effects, also in connection with phase transition problematics.
