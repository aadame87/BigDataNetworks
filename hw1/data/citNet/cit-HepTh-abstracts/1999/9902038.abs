  Models of interactions of D-dimensional hypermultiplets and supersymmetric
gauge multiplets with $\cN=8$ supercharges $(D{\leq} 6)$ can be formulated in
the framework of harmonic superspaces. The effective Coulomb low-energy action
for D=5 includes the free and Chern-Simons terms. We consider also the
non-Abelian superfield D=5 Chern-Simons action. The biharmonic $D=3,\cN=8$
superspace is introduced for a description of l and r supermultiplets and the
mirror symmetry. The D=2,(4,4) gauge theory and hypermultiplet interactions are
considered in the triharmonic superspace. Constraints for $D{=}1,\cN{=}8$
supermultiplets are solved with the help of the $SU(2){\times}Spin(5)$
harmonics. Effective gauge actions in the full $D{\leq}3,\cN{=}8$ superspaces
contain constrained (harmonic) superpotentials satisfying the (6-D) Laplace
equations for the gauge group U(1) or corresponding (6-D)p-dimensional
equations for the gauge groups $[U(1)]^p$. Generalized harmonic representations
of superpotentials connect equivalent superfield structures of these theories
in the full and analytic superspaces. The harmonic approach simplifies the
proofs of non-renormalization theorems.
