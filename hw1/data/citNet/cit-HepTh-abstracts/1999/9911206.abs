  Supersymmetric configurations of type II D-branes with nonzero gauge field
strengths in general supersymmetric backgrounds with nonzero B fields are
analyzed using the kappa-symmetric worldvolume action. It is found in dimension
four or greater that the usual instanton equation for the gauge field obtains a
nonlinear deformation. The deformation is parameterized by the topological data
of the B-field, the background geometry and the cycle wrapped by the brane. In
the appropriate dimensions, limits and settings these equations reduce to
deformed instanton equations recently found in the context of noncommutative
geometry as well as those following from Lagrangians based on Bott-Chern forms.
We further consider instantons comprised of M5-branes wrapping a Calabi-Yau
space with non-vanishing three-form field strengths. It is shown that the
instanton equations for the three-form are related to the Kodaira-Spencer
equations.
