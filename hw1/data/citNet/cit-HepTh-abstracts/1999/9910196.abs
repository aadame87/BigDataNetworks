  We study the structure of the monopole configuration in U(2) non-commutative
super Yang-Mills theory. Our analysis consists of two steps: solving the BPS
equation and then the eigenvalue equation in the non-commutative space.
Calculation to the first non-trivial order in the non-commutativity parameter
theta shows that the monopole exhibits a certain non-locality. This structure
is precisely the one expected from the recent predictions by the
brane-configuration technique.
