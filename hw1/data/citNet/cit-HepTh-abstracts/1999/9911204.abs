  We critically examine a recent suggestion that "ambiguous" statistics is
equivalent to infinite quon statistics and that it describes a dilute,
nonrelativistics ideal gas of extremal black holes. We show that these two
types of statistics are different and that the description of extremal black
holes in terms of "ambiguous" statistics cannot be applied.
