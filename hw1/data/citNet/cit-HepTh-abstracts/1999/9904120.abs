  The most radical version of the holographic principle asserts that all
information about physical processes in the world can be stored on its surface.
This formulation is at odds with inflationary cosmology, which implies that
physical processes in our part of the universe do not depend on the boundary
conditions. Also, there are some indications that the radical version of the
holographic theory in the context of cosmology may have problems with unitarity
and causality. Another formulation of the holographic principle, due to
Fischler and Susskind, implies that the entropy of matter inside the
post-inflationary particle horizon must be smaller than the area of the
horizon. Their conjecture was very successful for a wide class of open and flat
universes, but it did not apply to closed universes. Bak and Rey proposed a
different holographic bound on entropy which was valid for closed universes of
a certain type. However, as we will show, neither proposal applies to open,
flat and closed universes with matter and a small negative cosmological
constant. We will argue, in agreement with Easther, Lowe, and Veneziano, that
whenever the holographic constraint on the entropy inside the horizon is valid,
it follows from the Bekenstein-Hawking bound on the black hole entropy. These
constraints do not allow one to rule out closed universes and other universes
which may experience gravitational collapse, and do not impose any constraints
on inflationary cosmology.
