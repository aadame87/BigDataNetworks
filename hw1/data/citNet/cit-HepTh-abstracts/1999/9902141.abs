  We analyze the integrability properties of models defined on the symmetric
space SU(2)/U(1) in 3+1 dimensions, using a recently proposed approach for
integrable theories in any dimension. We point out the key ingredients for a
theory to possess an infinite number of local conservation laws, and discuss
classes of models with such property. We propose a 3+1-dimensional,
relativistic invariant field theory possessing a toroidal soliton solution
carrying a unit of topological charge given by the Hopf map. Construction of
the action is guided by the requirement that the energy of static configuration
should be scale invariant. The solution is constructed exactly. The model
possesses an infinite number of local conserved currents. The method is also
applied to the Skyrme-Faddeev model, and integrable submodels are proposed.
