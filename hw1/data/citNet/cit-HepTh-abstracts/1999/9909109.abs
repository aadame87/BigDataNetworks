  We study a ${{\IZ}}_2$ orbifold of Type 0B string theory by reflection of six
of the coordinates (this theory may also be thought of as a ${{\IZ}}_4$
orbifold of Type IIB string theory by a rotation by $\pi$ in three independent
planes). We show that the only massless mode localized on the fixed fourplane
$\IR^{3,1}$ is a U(1) gauge field. After introducing D3-branes parallel to the
fixed fourplane we find non-supersymmetric non-abelian gauge theories on their
worldvolume. One of our results is that the theory on equal numbers of electric
and magnetic D3-branes placed at the fourplane is the ${{\IZ}}_4$ orbifold of
${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by the center of its R-symmetry
group.
