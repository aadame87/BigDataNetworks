  We examine the effect of perturbative string loops on the cosmological
pre-big-bang evolution. We study loop corrections derived from heterotic string
theory compactified on a $Z_N$ orbifold and we consider the effect of the
all-order loop corrections to the Kahler potential and of the corrections to
gravitational couplings, including both threshold corrections and corrections
due to the mixed Kahler-gravitational anomaly. We find that string loops can
drive the evolution into the region of the parameter space where a graceful
exit is in principle possible, and we find solutions that, in the string frame,
connect smoothly the superinflationary pre-big-bang evolution to a phase where
the curvature and the derivative of the dilaton are decreasing. We also find
that at a critical coupling the loop corrections to the Kahler potential induce
a ghost-like instability, i.e. the kinetic term of the dilaton vanishes. This
is similar to what happens in Seiberg-Witten theory and signals the transition
to a new regime where the light modes in the effective action are different and
are related to the original ones by S-duality. In a string context, this means
that we enter a D-brane dominated phase.
