Title: Low Energy String: An Aristotelian Top ?

  It is argued that a low energy string may be an Aristotelian top, i.e. a
rigid body which however cannot be rotationally excited, but in an external
electromagnetic field exhibits a sort of precession with a Larmor type angular
velocity. On the basis of this observation a proposal is made for a new two
steps derivation of the electroweak standard model from the string dynamics. In
the first step a theory of Aristotelian top is formulated and studied in more
detail and in the second step an attempt is made to derive the electroweak
standard model from the top dynamics. Before the symmetry breaking fermions are
represented by straight frozen strings - rotators, whose symmetry under the
rotation around their axes is interpreted as the group $U(1)_Y$. The emergence
of $SU(2)_L$ group is somewhat less transparent and is supposed to be connected
with the new degree of freedom of relativistic rotators, which leads to the up
and down type fermions. The symmetry breaking is associated with the bending of
the rotators under the influence of Higgs field and with their subsequent
transformation into the curved frozen strings - tops. In this new picture of
electroweak interaction the chirality of the theory has a simple and natural
explanation, the weak isospin and hypercharge are inherent properties of
relativistic rotators/tops and the superselection rule associated with electric
charge is a consequence of the accepted distinction between up and down type
fermions.
