  We propose a new method to generate the internal isospin degree of freedom by
non-local bound states. This can be seen as motivated by Bargmann-Wigner like
considerations, which originated from local spin coupling. However, our
approach is not of purely group theoretical origin, but emerges from a
geometrical model. The rotational part of the Lorentz group can be seen to
mutate into the internal iso-group under some additional assumptions. The bound
states can thereafter be characterized by either a triple of spinors (\xi_1,
\xi_2, \eta) or a pair of an average spinor and a ``gauge'' transformation
(\phi, R). Therefore, this triple can be considered to be an isospinor.
Inducing the whole dynamics from the covariant gauge coupling we arrive at an
isospin gauge theory and its Lagrangian formulation. Clifford algebraic
methods, especially the Hestenes approach to the geometric meaning of spinors,
are the most useful concepts for such a development. The method is not
restricted to isospin, which served as an example only.
