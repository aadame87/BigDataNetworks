  We discuss the thermodynamics of a gas of black holes in five-dimensional
anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space, showing that they are described by a van der Waals
equation of state. Motivated by the Maldacena conjecture, we relate the energy
density and pressure of this non-ideal AdS black-hole gas to those of
four-dimensional gauge theory in the unconfined phase. We find that the energy
density rises rapidly above the deconfinement transition temperature, whilst
the pressure rises more slowly towards its asymptotic high-temperature value,
in qualitative agreement with lattice simulations.
