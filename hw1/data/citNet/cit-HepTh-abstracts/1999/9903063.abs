Title: Singularities in axially symmetric solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills and
  related theories
Authors: Ludger Hannibal
Comments: 3 pages, revtex
\\
  We show that the solutions of SU(2) Yang-Mills-dilation and
Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theories described in a sequence of papers by
Kleihaus and Kunz are not regular in the gauge field part.
