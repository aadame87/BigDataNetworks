Title: Aspects of Heterotic/M-Theory Duality in D=3
Authors: Michael Haack and Jan Louis
Comments: 5 pages, no figures, uses cargese.cls; changed some references and
  the discussion of the moduli space on the M-Theory side
\\
  We study the duality between M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds
and the heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds times a circle.
Our analysis is based on a comparison of the low energy effective actions in
three dimensions.
