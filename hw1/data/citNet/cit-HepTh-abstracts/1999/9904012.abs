  We provide compelling evidence that a previously introduced model of
non-perturbative 2d Lorentzian quantum gravity exhibits (two-dimensional)
flat-space behaviour when coupled to Ising spins. The evidence comes from both
a high-temperature expansion and from Monte Carlo simulations of the combined
gravity-matter system. This weak-coupling behaviour lends further support to
the conclusion that the Lorentzian model is a genuine alternative to Liouville
quantum gravity in two dimensions, with a different, and much `smoother'
critical behaviour.
