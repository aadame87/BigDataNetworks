  The system of D1 and D5 branes with a Kaluza-Klein momentum is
re-investigated using the five-dimensional U-duality group E_{6(+6)}(Z). We
show that the residual U-duality symmetry that keeps this D1-D5-KK system
intact is generically given by a lift of the Weyl group of F_{4(+4)}, embedded
as a finite subgroup in E_{6(+6)}(Z). We also show that the residual U-duality
group is enhanced to F_{4(+4)}(Z) when all the three charges coincide. We then
apply the analysis to the AdS(3)/CFT(2) correspondence, and discuss that among
28 marginal operators of CFT(2) which couple to massless scalars of AdS(3)
gravity at boundary, 16 would behave as exactly marginal operators for generic
D1-D5-KK systems. This is shown by analyzing possible three-point couplings
among 42 Kaluza-Klein scalars with the use of their transformation properties
under the residual U-duality group.
