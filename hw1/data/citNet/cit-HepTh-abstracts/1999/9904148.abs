  Using a boundary counterterm prescription motivated by the AdS/CFT
conjecture, I evaluate the energy, entropy and angular momentum of the class of
Kerr-NUT/bolt-AdS spacetimes. As in the non-rotating case, when the NUT charge
is nonzero the entropy is no longer equal to one-quarter of the area due to the
presence of the Misner string. When the cosmological constant is also non-zero,
the entropy is bounded from above.
