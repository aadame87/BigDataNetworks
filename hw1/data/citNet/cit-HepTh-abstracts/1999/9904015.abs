  The density of mass levels \rho(m) and the critical temperature for strings
in de Sitter space-time are found. QFT and string theory in de Sitter space are
compared. A `Dual'-transform is introduced which relates classical to quantum
string lengths, and more generally, QFT and string domains. Interestingly, the
string temperature in De Sitter space turns out to be the Dual transform of the
QFT-Hawking-Gibbons temperature. The back reaction problem for strings in de
Sitter space is addressed selfconsistently in the framework of the `string
analogue' model (or thermodynamical approach), which is well suited to combine
QFT and string study.We find de Sitter space-time is a self-consistent solution
of the semiclassical Einstein equations in this framework. Two branches for the
scalar curvature R(\pm) show up: a classical, low curvature solution (-), and a
quantum high curvature solution (+), enterely sustained by the strings. There
is a maximal value for the curvature R_{\max} due to the string back reaction.
Interestingly, our Dual relation manifests itself in the back reaction
solutions: the (-) branch is a classical phase for the geometry with intrinsic
temperature given by the QFT-Hawking-Gibbons temperature.The (+) is a stringy
phase for the geometry with temperature given by the intrinsic string de Sitter
temperature. 2 + 1 dimensions are considered, but conclusions hold generically
in D dimensions.
