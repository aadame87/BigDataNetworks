  We discuss the thermal properties of string gases propagating in various
D-brane backgrounds in the weak-coupling limit, and at temperatures close to
the Hagedorn temperature. We determine, in the canonical ensemble, whether the
Hagedorn temperature is limiting or non-limiting. This depends on the
dimensionality of the D-brane, and the size of the compact dimensions. We find
that in many cases the non-limiting behaviour manifest in the canonical
ensemble is modified to a limiting behaviour in the microcanonical ensemble and
show that, when there are different systems in thermal contact, the energy
flows into open strings on the `limiting' D-branes of largest dimensionality.
Such energy densities may eventually exceed the D-brane intrinsic tension. We
discuss possible implications of this for the survival of Dp-branes with large
values of p in an early cosmological Hagedorn regime. We also discuss the
general phase diagram of the interacting theory, as implied by the holographic
and black-hole/string correspondence principles.
