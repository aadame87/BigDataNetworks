  We find the spectrum P(w)dw of the gravitational wave background produced in
the early universe in string theory. We work in the framework of String Driven
Cosmology, whose scale factors are computed with the low-energy effective
string equations as well as selfconsistent solutions of General Relativity with
a gas of strings as source. The scale factor evolution is described by an early
string driven inflationary stage with an instantaneous transition to a
radiation dominated stage and successive matter dominated stage. This is an
expanding string cosmology always running on positive proper cosmic time. A
careful treatment of the scale factor evolution and involved transitions is
made. A full prediction on the power spectrum of gravitational waves without
any free-parameters is given. We study and show explicitly the effect of the
dilaton field, characteristic to this kind of cosmologies. We compute the
spectrum for the same evolution description with three differents approachs.
Some features of gravitational wave spectra, as peaks and asymptotic
behaviours, are found direct consequences of the dilaton involved and not only
of the scale factor evolution. A comparative analysis of different treatments,
solutions and compatibility with observational bounds or detection perspectives
is made.
