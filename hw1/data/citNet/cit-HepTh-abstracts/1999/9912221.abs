Title: Introduction to Hopf algebras in renormalization and noncommutative
  geometry
Authors: Raimar Wulkenhaar (CPT Marseille)
Comments: 12 pages, 1 eps figure, LaTeX 2e; based on talk at workshop `The
  Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics from a Mathematical-Geometrical
  Viewpoint', Hesselberg, March 1999; to appear in proceedings (written in May
  1999, recent developments not covered, hopefully still useful)
Report-no: CPT-99/P.3814

  We review the appearance of Hopf algebras in the renormalization of quantum
field theories and in the study of diffeomorphisms of the frame bundle
important for index computations in noncommutative geometry.
