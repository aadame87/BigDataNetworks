Title: The One-loop UV Divergent Structure of U(1) Yang-Mills Theory on
  Noncommutative R^4
Authors: C.P. Martin and D. Sanchez-Ruiz (Departamento de Fisica Teorica I,
  Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain)
Comments: 8 pages. A missing complex "i" is included in the field strength and
  the divergent contributions corrected accordingly. As a result the model
  turns out to be asymptotically free

  We show that U(1) Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative R^4 can be renormalized
at the one-loop level by multiplicative dimensional renormalization of the
coupling constant and fields of the theory. We compute the beta function of the
theory and conclude that the theory is asymptotically free. We also show that
the Weyl-Moyal matrix defining the deformed product over the space of functions
on R^4 is not renormalized at the one-loop level.
