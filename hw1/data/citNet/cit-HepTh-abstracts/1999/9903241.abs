  We consider the inclusion of brane charges in AdS_5 superalgebras that
contain the maximal central extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra on the
boundary of AdS_5. For theories with N supersymmetries on the boundary, the
maximal extension is OSp(1/8N,R), which contains the group $Sp(8N,R)\supset
U(2N,2N) \supset SU(2,2)\times U(N)$ as extension of the conformal group. An
``intermediate'' extension to U(2N,2N/1) is also discussed, as well as the
inclusion of brane charges in AdS_7 and AdS_4 superalgebras. BPS conditions in
the presence of brane charges are studied in some details.
