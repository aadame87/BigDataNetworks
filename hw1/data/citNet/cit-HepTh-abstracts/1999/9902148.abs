  We analyze p-brane black hole solutions with `block-orthogonal' intersection
rules. The post-Newtonian parameters beta and gamma corresponding to
4-dimensional section of the metric are calculated. A family of solutions with
gamma=1 is singled out. Some examples of solutions (e.g. in D=11 supergravity)
are considered.
