  The propagators in axial-type, light-cone and planar gauges contain
1/(\eta\cdot k)^p-type singularities. These singularities have generally been
treated by inventing prescriptions for them. In this work, we propose an
alternative procedure for treating these singularities in the path integral
formalism using the known way of treating the singularities in Lorentz gauges.
To this end, we use a finite field-dependent BRS transformation that
interpolates between Lorentz-type and the axial-type gauges. We arrive at the
$\epsilon$-dependent tree propagator in the axial-type gauges. We examine the
singularity structure of the propagator and find that the axial gauge
propagator so constructed has {\it no} spurious poles (for real $k$). It
however has a complicated structure in a small region near $\eta\cdot k=0$. We
show how this complicated structure can effectively be replaced by a much
simpler propagator.
