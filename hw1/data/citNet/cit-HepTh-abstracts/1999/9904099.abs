Title: Curvature relations in almost product manifolds
Authors: Magnus Holm and Niclas Sandstr\"{o}m
\\
  New relations involving curvature components for the various connections
appearing in the theory of almost product manifolds are given and the conformal
behaviour of these connections are studied. New identities for the irreducible
parts of the deformation tensor are derived. Some direct physical applications
in Kaluza-Klein and gauge theory are discussed.
