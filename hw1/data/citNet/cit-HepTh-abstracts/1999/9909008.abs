  Topological property in a spinning system should be directly associated with
its wavefunction. A complete decomposition formula of SU(2) gauge potential in
terms of spinning wavefunction is established rigorously. Based on the $\phi
$-mapping theory and this formula, one proves that the second Chern class is
inherent in the spinning system. It is showed that this topological invariant
is only determined by the Hopf index and Brouwer degree of the spinning
wavefunction.
