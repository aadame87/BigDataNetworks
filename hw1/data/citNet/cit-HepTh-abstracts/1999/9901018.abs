  This is a brief introductory review of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of the
ideas that led to its formulation. Emphasis is placed on dualities between
conformal large $N$ gauge theories in 4 dimensions and string backgrounds of
the form $AdS_5\times X_5$. Attempts to generalize this correspondence to
asymptotically free theories are also included.
