  One route towards understanding both fractional charges and chiral anomalies
delves into Dirac's negative energy sea. Usually we think of Dirac's negative
energy sea as an unphysical construct, invented to render quantum field theory
physically acceptable by hiding the negative energy solutions. I suggest that
in fact physical consequences can be drawn from Dirac's construction.
