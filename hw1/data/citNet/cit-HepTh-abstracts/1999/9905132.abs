  Using superfield Dyson-Schwinger equations, we compute the infrared dynamics
of the semi-amputated full vertex, corresponding to the effective running gauge
coupling, in N-flavour {\mathcal N}=1 supersymmetric QED(3). It is shown that
the presence of a supersymmetry-preserving mass for the matter multiplet
stabilizes the infrared gauge coupling against oscillations present in the
massless case, and we therefore infer that the massive vacuum is thus selected
at the level of the (quantum) effective action. We further demonstrate that
such a mass can indeed be generated dynamically in a self-consistent way by
appealing to the superfield Dyson-Schwinger gap equation for the full matter
propagator.
