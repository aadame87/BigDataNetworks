  The recently proposed physical projector approach to the quantisation of
gauge invariant systems is applied to the U(1) Chern-Simons theory in 2+1
dimensions as one of the simplest examples of a topological quantum field
theory. The physical projector is explicitely demonstrated to be capable of
effecting the required projection from the initially infinite number of degrees
of freedom to the finite set of gauge invariant physical states whose
properties are determined by the topology of the underlying manifold.
