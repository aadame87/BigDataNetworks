  The infinite dimensional generalization of the quantum mechanics of extended
objects, namely, the quantum field theory of extended objects is employed to
address the hitherto nonrenormalizable gravitational interaction following
which the cosmological constant problem is addressed. The response of an
electron to a weak gravitational field (linear approximation) is studied and
the order $\alpha$ correction to the magnetic gravitational moment is computed.
