  We consider D-branes wrapped around supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau
manifolds from the viewpoint of N=2 Landau-Ginzburg models with boundary as
well as by consideration of boundary states in the corresponding Gepner models.
The Landau-Ginzburg approach enables us to provide a target space
interpretation for the boundary states. The boundary states are obtained by
applying Cardy's procedure to combinations of characters in the Gepner models
which are invariant under spectral flow. We are able to relate the two
descriptions using the common discrete symmetries of the two descriptions. We
are thus able to provide an extension to the boundary of the bulk
correspondence between Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds and the corresponding Gepner
models.
