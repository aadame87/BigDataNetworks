  A non-local classical duality between the three-block truncated 11D
supergravity and the 8D vacuum gravity with two commuting Killing symmetries is
established. The supergravity four-form field is generated via an inverse
dualisation of the corresponding Killing two-forms in six dimensions. 11D
supersymmetry condition is shown to be equivalent to existence of covariantly
constant spinors in eight dimensions. Thus any solution to the vacuum Einstein
equations in eight dimensions depending on six coordinates and admitting
Killing spinors have supersymmetric 11D-supergravity counterparts. Using this
duality we derive some new brane solutions to 11D-supergravity including 1/4
supersymmetric intersecting M-branes with a NUT parameter and a dyon solution
joining the M2 and M5-branes intersecting at a point.
