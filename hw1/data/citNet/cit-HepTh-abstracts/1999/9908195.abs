  In these notes, the transverse ($\perp$) lattice approach is presented as a
means to control the $k^+\to 0$ divergences in light-front QCD. Technical
difficulties of both the canonical compact formulation as well as the
non-compact formulation of the $\perp$ lattice motivate the color-dielectric
formulation, where the link fields are linearized.
