  Renormalization group flow equations for scalar lambda Phi^4 are generated
using three classes of smooth smearing functions. Numerical results for the
critical exponent nu in three dimensions are calculated by means of a truncated
series expansion of the blocked potential. We demonstrate how the convergence
of nu as a function of the order of truncation can be improved through a fine
tuning of the smoothness of the smearing functions.
