  We present an investigation of the boundary breather states of the
sinh-Gordon model restricted to a half-line. The classical boundary breathers
are presented for a two parameter family of integrable boundary conditions.
Restricting to the case of boundary conditions which preserve the \phi -->
-\phi symmetry of the bulk theory, the energy spectrum of the boundary states
is computed in two ways: firstly, by using the bootstrap technique and
subsequently, by using a WKB approximation. Requiring that the two descriptions
of the spectrum agree with each other allows a determination of the
relationship between the boundary parameter, the bulk coupling constant, and
the parameter appearing in the reflection factor derived by Ghoshal to describe
the scattering of the sinh-Gordon particle from the boundary.
