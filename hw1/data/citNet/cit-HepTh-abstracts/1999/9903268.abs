Title: Superstrings, Unifications and dualities
Authors: Joseph Kouneiher
Comments: 31 pages, 9 figures. This conference is the first part of two
  lectures treating the geometric principle lying behind superstring theory. It
  is an introductory one
\\
  I describe our understanding of physics near the planck length, in particular
the great progress of the last four years in string theory. Superstring theory,
and a recent extension called M theory, are leading candidates for a quantum
theory that unifies gravity with the other forces. As such, they are certainly
not ordinary quantum field theories. However, recent duality conjectures
suggest that a more complete definition of these theories can be provided by
the large N limits of suitably chosen U(N) gauge theories associated to the
asymptotic boundary of spacetime.
