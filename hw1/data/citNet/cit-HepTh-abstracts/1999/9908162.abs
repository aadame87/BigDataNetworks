  Coincident M2 branes at a conical singularity are related to M theory on
AdS_4 x X_7 for an appropriate 7 dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifold X_7. For
X_7=Q^{1,1,1}=(SU(2) x SU(2) x SU(2))/(U(1) x U(1)) which was found sometime
ago, the infrared limit of the theory on N M2 branes was constructed recently.
It is the SU(N) x SU(N) x SU(N) gauge theories with three series of chiral
fields A_i, i=1,2 transforming in the (N, \bar{N},1) representation, B_j, j=1,2
transforming in the (1,N, \bar{N}) representation and C_k, k=1,2 transforming
in the (\bar{N},1,N) representation. From the scalar Laplacian of X_7 on the
supergravity side, we discuss the spectrum of chiral primary operators of dual
N=2 superconformal field theory in 3 dimensions. We study M5 branes wrapped
over 5-cycle of X_7 which were identified as (three types of) baryon like
operators made out of N chiral fields recently. We consider M5 brane wrapped
over 3-cycle of X_7 which plays the role of domain wall in AdS_4. The new
aspect arises when baryon like operators(M5 branes wrapped over 5-cycle) cross
a domain wall(M5 brane wrapped over 3-cycle), M2 brane between them must be
created.
