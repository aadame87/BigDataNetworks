  Supersymmetry is one of the most plausible and theoretically motivated
frameworks for extending the Standard Model. However, any supersymmetry in
Nature must be a broken symmetry. Dynamical supersymmetry breaking (DSB) is an
attractive idea for incorporating supersymmetry into a successful description
of Nature. The study of DSB has recently enjoyed dramatic progress, fueled by
advances in our understanding of the dynamics of supersymmetric field theories.
These advances have allowed for direct analysis of DSB in strongly coupled
theories, and for the discovery of new DSB theories, some of which contradict
early criteria for DSB. We review these criteria, emphasizing recently
discovered exceptions. We also describe, through many examples, various
techniques for directly establishing DSB by studying the infrared theory,
including both older techniques in regions of weak coupling, and new techniques
in regions of strong coupling. Finally, we present a list of representative DSB
models, their main properties, and the relations between them.
