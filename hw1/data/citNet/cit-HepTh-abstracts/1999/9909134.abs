  A method for obtaining solutions to the classical equations for scalars plus
gravity in five dimensions is applied to some recent suggestions for
brane-world phenomenology. The method involves only first order differential
equations. It is inspired by gauged supergravity but does not require
supersymmetry. Our first application is a full non-linear treatment of a
recently studied stabilization mechanism for inter-brane spacing. The spacing
is uniquely determined after conventional fine-tuning to achieve zero
four-dimensional cosmological constant. If the fine-tuning is imperfect, there
are solutions in which the four-dimensional branes are de Sitter or anti-de
Sitter spacetimes. Our second application is a construction of smooth domain
wall solutions which in a well-defined limit approach any desired array of
sharply localized positive-tension branes. As an offshoot of the analysis we
suggest a construction of a supergravity c-function for non-supersymmetric
four-dimensional renormalization group flows.
  The equations for fluctuations about an arbitrary scalar-gravity background
are also studied. It is shown that all models in which the fifth dimension is
effectively compactified contain a massless graviton. The graviton is the
constant mode in the fifth dimension. The separated wave equation can be recast
into the form of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The graviton wave-function
is then the supersymmetric ground state, and there are no tachyons.
