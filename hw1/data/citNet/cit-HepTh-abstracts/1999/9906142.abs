  We review the geometrical approach to the description of the dynamics of
super-p-branes, Dirichlet branes and the M5-brane, which is based on a
generalization of the elements of surface theory to the description of the
embedding of supersurfaces into target superspaces. Being manifestly
supersymmetric in both, the superworldvolume of the brane and the target
superspace, this approach unifies the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond and the
Green-Schwarz formulation and provides the fermionic kappa-symmetry of the
Green-Schwarz-type superbrane actions with a clear geometrical meaning of
standard worldvolume local supersymmetry. We describe the properties of doubly
supersymmetric (superembedding) brane actions and show how they are related to
the standard Green-Schwarz formulation. In the second part of the article basic
geometrical grounds of the (super)embedding approach are considered and applied
to the description of the M2-brane and the M5-brane. Various applications of
the superembedding approach are reviewed.
