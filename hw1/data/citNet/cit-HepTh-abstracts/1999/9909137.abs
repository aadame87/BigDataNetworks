  We derive the invariant operators of the zero-form, the one-form, the
two-form and the spinor from which the mass spectrum of Kaluza Klein of
eleven-dimensional supergravity on AdS_4 x N^{010} can be derived by means of
harmonic analysis. We calculate their eigenvalues for all representations of
SU(3)xSO(3). We show that the information contained in these operators is
sufficient to reconstruct the complete N=3 supersymmetry content of the
compactified theory. We find the N=3 massless graviton multiplet, the Betti
multiplet and the SU(3) Killing vector multiplet.
