  We show that the recently formulated Equivalence Principle (EP) implies a
basic cocycle condition both in Euclidean and Minkowski spaces, which holds in
any dimension. This condition, that in one-dimension is sufficient to fix the
Schwarzian equation [6], implies a fundamental higher dimensional Moebius
invariance which in turn univocally fixes the quantum version of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This holds also in the relativistic case, so that we
obtain both the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordon
equation in any dimension. We then show that the EP implies that masses are
related by maps induced by the coordinate transformations connecting different
physical systems. Furthermore, we show that the minimal coupling prescription,
and therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing the EP.
Finally, we show that there is an antisymmetric two-tensor which underlies
Quantum Mechanics and sheds new light on the nature of the Quantum
Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
