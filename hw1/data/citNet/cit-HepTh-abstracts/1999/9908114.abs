  Light cone gauge manifestly supersymmetric formulations of type IIB
10-dimensional supergravity in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background and related
boundary conformal field theory representations are developed. A precise
correspondence between the bulk fields of IIB supergravity and the boundary
operators is established. The formulations are given entirely in terms of light
cone scalar superfields, allowing us to treat all component fields on an equal
footing.
