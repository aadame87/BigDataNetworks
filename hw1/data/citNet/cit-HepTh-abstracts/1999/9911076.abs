  Applying the distributional formalism to study the dynamics of thin shells in
general relativity, we regain the junction equations for matching of two
spherically symmetric spacetimes separated by a singular hypersurface. In
particular, we have shown how to define and insert the relevant sign functions
in the junction equations corresponding to the signs of the extrinsic curvature
tensor occurred in the Darmois-Israel method.
