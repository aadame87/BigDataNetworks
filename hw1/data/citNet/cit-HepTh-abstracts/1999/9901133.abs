  The SU(2) collective coordinates quantization of the Born-Infeld Skyrmions
Lagrangean is performed. The obtainment of the classical Hamiltonian from this
special Lagrangean is made by using an approximate way: it is derived from the
expansion of this non-polynomial Lagrangean up to second-order variable in the
collective coordinates, using for this some causality arguments. Because this
system presents constraints, we use the Dirac Hamiltonian method and the
Faddeev-Jackiw Lagrangean approach to quantize this model.
