Title: On the Groundstate of Yang-Mills Quantum Mechanics
Authors: A.M. Khvedelidze and H.-P. Pavel
Comments: 4 pages REVTEX twocolumn, no figures; important calculational mistake
  corrected which considerably changes the conclusions; references added

\\
  A systematic method to calculate the low energy spectrum of SU(2) Yang-Mills
quantum mechanics with high precision is given and applied to obtain the
energies of the groundstate and the first few excited states.
