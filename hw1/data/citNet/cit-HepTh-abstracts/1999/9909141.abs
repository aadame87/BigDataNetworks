  We look back at early efforts to approximate the large N_c Feynman diagrams
of QCD as very large fishnet diagrams. We consider more carefully the
uniqueness of rules for discretizing P^+ and ix^+ which fix the fishnet model
in the strong 't Hooft coupling limit, and we offer some refinements that allow
more of the crucial QCD interactions to be retained in the fishnet
approximation. This new discretization has a better chance to lead to a
physically sensible `bare QCD string' model. Not surprisingly the resulting
fishnet diagrams are both richer in structure and harder to evaluate than those
considered in older work. As warm-ups we analyze arbitrarily large fishnets of
a paradigm scalar cubic theory and very small fishnets of QCD.
