Title: General Relativity + Quantum mechanics --> Discretized Momentum
Authors: H. Gopalkrishna Gadiyar
Comments: 3 pages
Report-no: GAD-1/99
\\
  The analogy between General Relativity and monopole physics is pointed out
and the presence of a 3-cocycle which corresponds to a source leads to
discretization of field momentum. This is analogous to the same phenomena in
monopole physics.
