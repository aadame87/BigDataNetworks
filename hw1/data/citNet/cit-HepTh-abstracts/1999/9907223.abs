  We show that the vacuum of the quantized massless spinor field in
2+1-dimensional space-time is polarized in the presence of a singular magnetic
vortex. Depending on the choice of the boundary condition at the location of
the vortex, either chiral symmetry or parity is broken; the formation of the
appropriate vacuum condensates is comprehensively studied. In addition, we find
that current, energy and other quantum numbers are induced in the vacuum.
