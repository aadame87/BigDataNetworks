  In this letter the boundary problem for massless and massive Rarita-Schwinger
field in the AdS/CFT correspondence is considered. The considerations are along
the lines of a paper by Henneaux (hep-th/9902137) and are based on the
requirement the solutions to be a stationary point for the action functional.
It is shown that this requirement, along with a definite asymptotic behavior of
the solutions, fixes the boundary term that must be added to the initial
Rarita-Schwinger action. It is also shown that the boundary term reproduce the
known two point correlation functions of certain local operators in CFT living
on the boundary.
