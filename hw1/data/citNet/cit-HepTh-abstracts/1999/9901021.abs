Title: Conformal Anomaly Of Submanifold Observables In AdS/CFT Correspondence

  We analyze the conformal invariance of submanifold observables associated
with $k$-branes in the AdS/CFT correspondence. For odd $k$, the resulting
observables are conformally invariant, and for even $k$, they transform with a
conformal anomaly that is given by a local expression which we analyze in
detail for $k=2$
