  We define a non-local gauge-invariant Green's function which can distinguish
between the symmetric (confinement) and broken (Higgs) phases of the hot
SU(2)xU(1) electroweak theory to all orders in the perturbative expansion. It
is related to the coupling of the Chern-Simons number to a massless Abelian
gauge field. The result implies either that there is a way to distinguish
between the phases, even though the macroscopic thermodynamical properties of
the system have been observed to be smoothly connected, or that the
perturbative Coleman-Hill theorem on which the argument is based, is
circumvented by non-perturbative effects. We point out that this question could
in principle be studied with three-dimensional lattice simulations.
