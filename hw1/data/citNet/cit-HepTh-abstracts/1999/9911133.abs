  We consider the Non-Abelian Chern-Simons term coupled to external particles,
in a gauge and diffeomorphism invariant form. The classical equations of motion
are perturbativelly studied, and the on-shell action is shown to produce
knot-invariants associated with the sources. The first contributions are
explicitly calculated, and the corresponding knot-invariants are recognized.
We conclude that the interplay between Knot Theory and Topological Field
Theories is manifested not only at the quantum level, but in a classical
context as well.
