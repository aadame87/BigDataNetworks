  B-type D-branes are constructed on two different K3-fibrations over IP_1
using boundary conformal field theory at the rational Gepner points of these
models. The microscopic CFT charges are compared with the Ramond charges of
D-branes wrapped on holomorphic cycles of the corresponding Calabi-Yau
manifold. We study in particular D4-branes and bundles localized on the K3
fibers, and find from CFT that each irreducible component of a bundle on K3
gains one modulus upon fibration over IP_1. This is in agreement with
expectations and so provides a further test of the boundary CFT.
