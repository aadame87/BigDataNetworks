  We derive model independent, non-perturbative supersymmetric sum rules for
the gravitational quadrupole moments of arbitrary-spin particles in any N=1
supersymmetric theory. These sum rules select a ``preferred'' value of h=1
where the ``h-factor'' is the gravitational quadrupole analog of the
gyromagnetic ratio or g-factor. This value of h=1 corresponds identically to
the preferred field theory value obtained by tree-level unitarity
considerations. The presently derived h-factor sum rule complements and
generalizes previous work on electromagnetic moments where g=2 was shown to be
preferred by both supersymmetric sum rule and tree-level unitarity arguments.
