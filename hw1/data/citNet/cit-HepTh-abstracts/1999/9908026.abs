  We derive a formula for the large N behaviour of the expectation values of an
arbitrary product of Wilson loops in the adjoint representation. We show the
consequences of our formula for the study of the large N strong coupling
behaviour of SU(N)/Z_N pure gauge theories, and theories with matter fields in
the adjoint representation. This allows us to calculate large N corrections to
the gluino condensate and meson propagators in the lattice version of
Supersymmetric Yang-Mills. Applications to the strong coupling behaviour of the
Kazakov-Migdal model are also given.
