  String theory on curved backgrounds has received much attention on account of
both its own interest, and of its relation with gauge theories. Despite the
progress made in various directions, several quite elementary questions remain
unanswered, in particular in the very simple case of three-dimensional anti-de
Sitter space. I will very briefly review these problems, discuss in some detail
the important issue of constructing a consistent spectrum for a string
propagating on ADS3 plus torsion background, and comment on potential
solutions.
