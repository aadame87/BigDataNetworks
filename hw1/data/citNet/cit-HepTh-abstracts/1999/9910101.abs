  The quantum field theory describing electric and magnetic charges and
revealing a dual symmetry was developed in the Zwanziger formalism. The
renormalization group (RG) equations for both fine structure constants -
electric $\alpha$ and magnetic $\tilde \alpha$ - were obtained. It was shown
that the Dirac relation is valid for the renormalized $\alpha $ and $\tilde
\alpha$ at the arbitrary scale, but these RG equations can be considered
perturbatively only in the small region: $0.25 \stackrel{<}{\sim} \alpha,
\tilde \alpha \stackrel{<}{\sim} 1$ with $\tilde \alpha$ given by the Dirac
relation: $\alpha {\tilde \alpha}$ = 1/4.
