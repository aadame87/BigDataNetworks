  We construct D-brane states on an asymmetric orbifold of type IIA on a
four-torus, which is modded out by T-duality. We find explicit boundary states
charged under the twisted sector gauge fields. Unlike other cases, the boundary
states involve an explicit dependence on the twist fields. The D-brane spectrum
is consistent with the model being equivalent to type IIA on a four-torus.
