  We study the interaction between a tensionless (null) string and an
antisymmetric background field B_{ab} using a 2-component spinor formalism. A
geometric condition for the absence of such an interaction is formulated. We
show that only one gauge-invariant degree of freedom of the field B_{ab} does
not satisfy this condition. Identification of this degree of freedom with the
notoph field \phi of Ogievetskii-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond is suggested.
Application of a two-component spinor formalism allows us a reduction of the
complete system of non-linear partial differential equations and constraints
governing the interacting null string dynamics to a system of linear
differential equations for the basis spinors of the spin-frame. We find that
total effect of the interaction is contained in a single derivation coefficient
which is identified with the notoph field.
