  We present new analytic and numerical results for self-gravitating
SU(2)-Higgs magnetic monopoles approaching the black hole threshold. Our
investigation extends to large Higgs self-coupling, lambda, a regime heretofore
unexplored. When lambda is small, the critical solution where a horizon first
appears is extremal Reissner-Nordstrom outside the horizon but has a
nonsingular interior. When lambda is large, the critical solution is an
extremal black hole with non-Abelian hair and a mass less than the extremal
Reissner-Nordstrom value. The transition between these two regimes is
reminiscent of a first-order phase transition. We analyze in detail the
approach to these critical solutions as the Higgs expectation value is varied,
and compare this analysis with the numerical results.
