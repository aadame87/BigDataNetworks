  We present a systematic and 'from the ground up' analysis of the 'minimal
coupling' type of gauging of Yang-Mills symmetries in (2,2)-supersymmetric
1+1-dimensional spacetime. Unlike in the familiar 3+1-dimensional N=1
supersymmetric case, we find several distinct types of minimal coupling
symmetry gauging, and so several distinct types of gauge (super)fields, some of
which entirely novel. Also, we find that certain (quartoid) constrained
superfields can couple to no gauge superfield at all, others (haploid ones) can
couple only very selectively, while still others (non-minimal, i.e., linear
ones) couple universally to all gauge superfields.
