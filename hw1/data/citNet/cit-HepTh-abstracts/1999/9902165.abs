  We propose a lattice version of Chern-Simons gravity and show that the
partition function coincides with Ponzano-Regge model and the action leads to
the Chern-Simons gravity in the continuum limit. The action is explicitly
constructed by lattice dreibein and spin connection and is shown to be
invariant under lattice local Lorentz transformation and gauge diffeomorphism.
The action includes the constraint which can be interpreted as a gauge fixing
condition of the lattice gauge diffeomorphism.
