  In this paper we prove that for a large and physically relevant class of
smooth complete metrics on open four-manifolds the set of L^2-norms of
(anti)instantons is a discrete set for physically relevant Lie-groups. The
proof is based on the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer Index Theorem. To demonstrate our
result we consider the Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold. This metric is
significantly non-cylindrical hence standard techniques are not applicable for
studying the moduli space of instantons in this physically relavant case. In
this case the L^2-norm of an (anti)instanton is an integer similarly to the
flat R^4-case.
