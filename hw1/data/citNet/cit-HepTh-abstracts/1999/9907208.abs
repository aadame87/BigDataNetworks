  We present a simple algorithm to implement the generalized derivative
expansion introduced previously by L-H. Chan, and apply it to the calculation
of the one-loop mass correction to the classical soliton mass in the 1+1
dimensional Jacobi model. We then show how this derivative expansion approach
implies that the total (bosonic plus fermionic) mass correction in an N=1
supersymmetric soliton model is determined solely by the asymptotic values (and
derivatives) of the fermionic background potential. For a static soliton the
total mass correction is $-m/(2\pi)$, in agreement with recent analyses using
phase-shift methods.
