  We explore quantum states of instanton solitons in five dimensional
noncommutative Yang-Mills theories. We start with maximally supersymmetric U(N)
theory compactified on a circle S^1, and derive the low energy dynamics of
instanton solitons, or calorons, which is no longer singular. Quantizing the
low energy dynamics, we find N physically distinct ground states with a unit
Pontryagin number and no electric charge. These states have a natural D-string
interpretation. The conclusion remains unchanged as we decompactify S^1, as
long as we stay in the Coulomb phase by turning on adjoint Higgs expectation
values.
