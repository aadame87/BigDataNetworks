  Recent progress in mathematical theory of random processes provides us with
non-Fock product systems (continuous tensor products of Hilbert spaces) used
here for constructing a toy model for fermions. Some state vectors describe
infinitely many particles in a finite region; the particles accumulate to a
point. Electric charge can be assigned to the particles, the total charge being
zero. Time dynamics is not considered yet, only kinematics (a single time
instant).
