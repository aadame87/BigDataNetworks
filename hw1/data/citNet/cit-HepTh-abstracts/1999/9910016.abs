  We show that extremal correlators of chiral primary operators in N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with SU(N) gauge group are neither
renormalised at first order in perturbation theory nor receive contribution
from any instanton sector at leading order in the semiclassical expansion. This
lends support to the strongest version of a new prediction recently put forward
on the basis of the AdS/SCFT correspondence.
