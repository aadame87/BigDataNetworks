  The ADHM construction, which yields (anti-)selfdual configurations in
classical Yang-Mills theories, is applied to an infinite dimensional l^2 vector
space, and as a consequence, a family of (anti-)selfdual configurations with a
parameter q is obtained for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. This l^2 formulation can
be seen as a q-analog of Nahm's monopole construction, so that the
configuration approaches the BPS monopole at q->1 limit.
