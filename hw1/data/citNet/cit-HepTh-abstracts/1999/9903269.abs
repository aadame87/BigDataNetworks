  We investigate maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions and some of
its solitonic solutions. By focusing on a truncation of the gauged SO(5)
R-symmetry group to its U(1)^2 Cartan subgroup, we construct general two charge
black holes that are asymptotically anti-de Sitter. We demonstrate that 1- and
2-charge black holes preserve 1/2 and 1/4 of the supersymmetries respectively.
Additionally, we examine the odd-dimensional self-duality equation governing
the three-form potential transforming as the 5 of SO(5), and provide some
insight on the construction of membrane solutions in anti-de Sitter
backgrounds.
