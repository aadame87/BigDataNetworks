  We compare two opposite ways of performing a 3D reduction of the two-fermion
Bethe-Salpeter equation beyond the instantaneous approximation and Salpeter's
equation. The more usual method consists in performing an expansion around an
instantaneous approximation of the product of the free propagators
(propagator-approximated reduction). The second method starts with an
instantaneous approximation of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel (kernel-approximated
reduction). In both reductions the final 3D potential can be obtained by
following simple modified Feynman rules. The kernel-approximated reduction,
however, does not give the correct scattering amplitudes, and must thus be
limited to the computation of bound states. Our 3D reduction of the
three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation is inspired by these results. We expand
this equation around positive-energy instantaneous approximations of the three
two-body kernels, but these starting approximations are given by
propagator-approximated reductions at the two-body level. The three-fermion
Bethe-Salpeter equation is first transformed into a set of three coupled
equations for three wave functions depending each on one two-fermion total
energy, then into a set of three 3D equations and finally into a single 3D
equation. This last equation is rather complicated, as it combines three series
expansions, but we use it to write a manageable expression of the first-order
corrections to the energy spectrum.
