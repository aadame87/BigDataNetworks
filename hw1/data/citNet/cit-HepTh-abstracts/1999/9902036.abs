  In this thesis, I use the strong coupling expansion to investigate the
multiflavor lattice Schwinger models in the hamiltonian formalism using
staggered fermions. In particular, I am interested in analysing the mapping of
these gauge theories onto quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains.
Exploting this mapping, the chiral symmetry breaking patterns are studied and
the spectra are computed. The extrapolation to zero lattice spacing of the
results compare favorably qualitatively and quantitatively with the weak
coupling studies of the gauge models in the continuum.
