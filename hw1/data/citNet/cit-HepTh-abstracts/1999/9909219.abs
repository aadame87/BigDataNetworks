  It is emphasized that compactified little string theories have compact moduli
spaces of vacua, which globally probe compact string geometry. Compactifying
various little string theories on T^3 leads to 3d theories with exact, quantum
Coulomb branch given by: an arbitrary T^4 of volume M_s^2, an arbitrary K3 of
volume M_s^2, and moduli spaces of G=SU(N), SO(2N), or E_{6,7,8} instantons on
an arbitrary T^4 or K3 of fixed volume. Compactifying instead on a T^2 leads to
4d theories with a compact Coulomb branch base which, when combined with the
exact photon gauge coupling fiber, is a compact, elliptically-fibered space
related to the above spaces.
