  We find the solution of the $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ singular vector decoupling
equations on 3-point functions for the particular case when one of the fields
is of weight $w_0\cdot k\Lambda_0$. The result is a function with non-trivial
singularities in the flag variables, namely a linear combination of 2F1
hypergeometric functions. This calculation fills in a gap in [1] and confirms
the $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ fusion rules determined there both for generic $\kappa \not
\in \IQ$ and fractional levels.
  We have also analysed the fusion in $\hat{sl}(3)_k$ using algebraic methods
generalising those of Feigin and Fuchs and again find agreement with [1]. In
the process we clarify some details of previous treatments of the fusion of
$\hat{sl}(2)_k$ fractional level admissible representations.
