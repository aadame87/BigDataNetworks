  A renormalization scheme is suggested where QCD input parameters - quark mass
and coupling constant - are expressed in terms of gauge invariant and infrared
stable quantities. For the renormalization of coupling constant the quark
anomalous electromagnetic moment is used; the latter is calculated in a two
loop approximation. Examination of the renormalized S matrix indicated
confinement phenomenon already in the framework of perturbation theory.
