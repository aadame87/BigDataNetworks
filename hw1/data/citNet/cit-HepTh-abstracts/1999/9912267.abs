  Starting from 2D Euclidean quantum gravity, we show that one recovers 2D
Lorentzian quantum gravity by removing all baby universes. Using a peeling
procedure to decompose the discrete, triangulated geometries along a
one-dimensional path, we explicitly associate with each Euclidean space-time a
(generalized) Lorentzian space-time. This motivates a map between the parameter
spaces of the two theories, under which their propagators get identified. In
two dimensions, Lorentzian quantum gravity can therefore be viewed as a
``renormalized'' version of Euclidean quantum gravity.
