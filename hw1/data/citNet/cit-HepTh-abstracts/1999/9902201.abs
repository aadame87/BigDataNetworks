Title: On the structure of exact effective action for N=1 supersymmetric
  theories
Authors: K.Stepanyantz
Comments: 12 pages, LATEX, no figures
\\
  We discuss the ways of constructing the exact superpotential for N=1
supersymmetric theories and propose a new approach. As a consequence, a new
structure of the superpotential is found.
