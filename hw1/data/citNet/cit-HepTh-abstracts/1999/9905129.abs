  The one loop gluon - W-meson amplitude is calculated by means of the
gauge-invariant generalized Pauli-Villars regularization and with the help of
dimensional regularization. It is shown that in the former case the amplitude
satisfies Generalized Ward Identities, whereas in the latter case the amplitude
differs from the first one by the constant.
