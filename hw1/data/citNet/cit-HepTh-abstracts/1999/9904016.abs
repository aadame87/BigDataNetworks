  We define supersymmetric spin networks, which provide a complete set of gauge
invariant states for supergravity and supersymmetric gauge theories. The
particular case of Osp(1/2) is studied in detail and applied to the
non-perturbative quantization of supergravity. The supersymmetric extension of
the area operator is defined and partly diagonalized. The spectrum is discrete
as in quantum general relativity, and the two cases could be distinguished by
measurements of quantum geometry.
