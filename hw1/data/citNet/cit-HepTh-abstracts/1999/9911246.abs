  There is a close relation between classical supergravity and quantum SYM
descriptions of interactions between separated branes. In the case of D3
branes, the equivalence of leading-order potentials is due to
non-renormalization of the F^4 term in N=4 SYM theory. Here we point out the
existence of another special non-renormalized term in quantum SYM effective
action. This term reproduces the interaction potential between electric charge
of a D3-brane probe and magnetic charge of a D3-brane source, represented by
the Chern-Simons part of the D-brane action. This unique Wess-Zumino term
depends on all six scalar fields and originates from a phase of the euclidean
fermion determinant in SYM theory. It is manifestly scale invariant (i.e. is
the same for large and small separations between branes) and can not receive
higher loop corrections in gauge theory. Maximally supersymmetric SYM theories
in D=p+1>4 contain mixed WZ terms which depend on both scalar and gauge field
backgrounds, and which reproduce the corresponding CS terms in the supergravity
interaction potentials between separated Dp-branes for p>3. Purely scalar WZ
terms appear in other cases, e.g., in N=2 gauge theories in various dimensions
describing magnetic interactions between Dp and D(6-p) branes.
