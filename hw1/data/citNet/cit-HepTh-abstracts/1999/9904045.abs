  By making use of the background field method, we derive a novel reformulation
of the Yang-Mills theory which was proposed recently by the author to derive
quark confinement in QCD. This reformulation identifies the Yang-Mills theory
with a deformation of a topological quantum field theory. The relevant
background is given by the topologically non-trivial field configuration,
especially, the topological soliton which can be identified with the magnetic
monopole current in four dimensions. We argue that the gauge fixing term
becomes dynamical and that the gluon mass generation takes place by a
spontaneous breakdown of the hidden supersymmetry caused by the dimensional
reduction. We also propose a numerical simulation to confirm the validity of
the scheme we have proposed. Finally we point out that the gauge fixing part
may have a geometric meaning from the viewpoint of global topology where the
magnetic monopole solution represents the critical point of a Morse function in
the space of field configurations.
