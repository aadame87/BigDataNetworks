Title: Killing spinors, supersymmetries and rotating intersecting branes
Authors: P.K. Townsend
Comments: To appear in proceedings of the 22nd Johns Hopkins Workshop,
  Gothenburg, 1998. Latex 6pp
\\
  I review a recently proposed method for determining the symmetry superalgebra
of a supergravity configuration from its Killing spinors, and its application
to the `near-horizon' limits of various rotating and intersecting branes.
