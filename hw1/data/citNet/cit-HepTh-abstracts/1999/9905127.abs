  It has been conjectured that the Abelian projection of QCD is responsible for
the confinement of color. Using a gauge independent definition of the Abelian
projection which does {\it not} employ any gauge fixing, we provide a strong
evidence for the Abelian dominance in Wilson loop integral. In specific we
prove that the gauge potential which contributes to the Wilson loop integral is
precisely the one restricted by the Abelian projection.
