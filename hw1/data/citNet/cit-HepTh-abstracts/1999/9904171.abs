  In this work we examine generalized Connes-Lott models on the two-sphere. The
Hilbert space of the continuum spectral triple is taken as the space of
sections of a twisted spinor bundle, allowing for nontrivial topological
structure (magnetic monopoles). The finitely generated projective module over
the full algebra is also taken as topologically non-trivial, which is possible
over $S^2$. We also construct a real spectral triple enlarging this Hilbert
space to include "particle" and "anti-particle" fields.
