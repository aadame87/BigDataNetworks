Title: Nature: "I have Two Times"
Authors: Sascha Vongehr
Comments: 8 pages, two formulas corrected
\\
  This is a slightly extended version of a seminar given the 8th of June at the
TASI 99 at Colorado University in Boulder. The motivations behind two time
theory are explained and the theory is introduced via one of the theory's
easier gauges of a particle on a black hole background. Important results that
should be interesting as well in the light of the recent AdS mania will be
summarized.
