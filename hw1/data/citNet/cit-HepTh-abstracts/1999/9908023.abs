  We show how to construct chiral tachyon-free perturbative orientifold models,
where supersymmetry is broken at the string scale on a collection of branes
while, to lowest order, the bulk and the other branes are supersymmetric. In
higher orders, supersymmetry breaking is mediated to the remaining sectors, but
is suppressed by the size of the transverse space or by the distance from the
brane where supersymmetry breaking primarily occurred. This setting is of
interest for orbifold models with discrete torsion, and is of direct relevance
for low-scale string models. It can guarantee the stability of the gauge
hierarchy against gravitational radiative corrections, allowing an almost exact
supergravity a millimeter away from a non-supersymmetric world.
