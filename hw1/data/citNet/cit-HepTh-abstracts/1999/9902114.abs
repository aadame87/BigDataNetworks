  In this paper we present a renormalizability proof for spontaneously broken
SU(2) gauge theory. It is based on Flow Equations, i.e. on the Wilson
renormalization group adapted to perturbation theory. The power counting part
of the proof, which is conceptually and technically simple, follows the same
lines as that for any other renormalizable theory. The main difficulty stems
from the fact that the regularization violates gauge invariance. We prove that
there exists a class of renormalization conditions such that the renormalized
Green functions satisfy the Slavnov-Taylor identities of SU(2) Yang-Mills
theory on which the gauge invariance of the renormalized theory is based.
