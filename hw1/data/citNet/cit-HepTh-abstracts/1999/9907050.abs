  The precise relationship between the arbitrary monodromy dependent 2-form
appearing in the chiral WZNW symplectic form and the `exchange r-matrix' that
governs the corresponding Poisson brackets is established. Generalizing earlier
results related to diagonal monodromy, the exchange r-matrices are shown to
satisfy a new dynamical generalization of the classical modified Yang-Baxter
equation, which is found to admit an interpretation in terms of (new)
Poisson-Lie groupoids. Dynamical exchange r-matrices for which right
multiplication yields a classical or a Poisson-Lie symmetry on the chiral WZNW
phase space are presented explicitly.
