  In general relativity and electrodynamics fields are always generated from
static monopoles (like mass or electric charge) or their corresponding currents
by surrounding them in a spherical configuration. We investigate a generation
of fields from primary fields by a scalar coupling. The generated secondary
fields fulfill the condition of source-freedom and therefore cannot occur in a
spherical configuration. The coupling strength depends on the energies of the
primary fields. In most cases these fields can be approximately considered as
dipole fields. We discuss two applications of couplings for electromagnetic and
gravitational spin-1 fields and for electric and magnetic fields. We calculate
for both applications the threshold values of field energy for the maximum
coupling strength. The proposed approach yields to a further step towards an
unification of electromagnetism and gravitation and has important consequences
for the discrete symmetries.
