  A Hamiltonian analysis of Yang-Mills (YM) theory in (2+1) dimensions with a
level $k$ Chern-Simons term is carried out using a gauge invariant matrix
parametrization of the potentials. The gauge boson states are constructed and
the contribution of the dynamical mass gap to the gauge boson mass is obtained.
Long distance properties of vacuum expectation values are related to a
Euclidean two-dimensional YM theory coupled to $k$ flavors of Dirac fermions in
the fundamental representation. We also discuss the expectation value of the
Wilson loop operator and give a comparison with previous results.
