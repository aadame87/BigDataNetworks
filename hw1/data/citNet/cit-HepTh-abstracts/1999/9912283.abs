  We show that quantum effects can stabilize a soliton in a model with no
soliton at the classical level. The model has a scalar field chirally coupled
to a fermion in 1+1 dimensions. We use a formalism that allows us to calculate
the exact one loop fermion contribution to the effective energy for a spatially
varying scalar background. This energy includes the contribution from
counterterms fixed in the perturbative sector of the theory. The resulting
energy is therefore finite and unambiguous. A variational search then yields a
fermion number one configuration whose energy is below that of a single free
fermion.
