  We discuss absorption of scalars by a distribution of spinning D3-branes. The
D3-branes are multi-center solutions of supergravity theory. We solve the wave
equation in various cases of supergravity backgrounds in which the equation
becomes separable. We show that the absorption coefficients exhibit a universal
behavior as functions of the angular momentum quantum number and the Hawking
temperature. This behavior is similar to the form of the gray-body factors one
encounters in scattering by black-holes. Our discussion includes the
problematic case of spherically symmetric distributions of D-branes, where
resonances arise. We obtain the same universal form for the absorption
coefficients, if the region enclosed by the D-branes is excluded from physical
considerations. Non-extremal D-branes are also discussed. The results are
similar to the extremal cases, albeit at half the Hawking temperature. We
speculate that new degrees of freedom enter as one moves away from extremality.
