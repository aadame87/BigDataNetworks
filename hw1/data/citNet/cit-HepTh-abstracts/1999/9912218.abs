  We discuss the open descendants of diagonal irrational $Z_3$ orbifolds,
starting from the $c=2$ case and analyzing six-dimensional and four-dimensional
models. As recently argued, their consistency is linked to the presence of
geometric discrete moduli. The different classes of open descendants, related
to different resolutions of the fixed-point ambiguities, are distinguished by
the number of geometric fixed points surviving the unoriented projection.
