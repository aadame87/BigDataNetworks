  We consider the construction of a general tree level amplitude for the
interactions between dynamical D-branes where the configurations have non-zero
odd spin structure. Using Riemann Theta Identities we map the conditions for
the preservation of some supersymmetry to a set of integer matrices satisfying
a simple but non-trivial equation. We also show how the regularization of the
RR zero modes plays an important role in determining which configurations are
permitted.
