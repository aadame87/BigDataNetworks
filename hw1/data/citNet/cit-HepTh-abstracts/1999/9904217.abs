  When an M-theory fivebrane wraps a holomorphic surface $\CP$ in a Calabi-Yau
3-fold $X$ the low energy dynamics is that of a black string in 5 dimensional
$\CN=1$ supergravity. The infrared dynamics on the string worldsheet is an $\CN
= (0,4)$ 2D conformal field theory. Assuming the 2D CFT can be described as a
nonlinear sigma model, we describe the target space geometry of this model in
terms of the data of $X$ and $\CP$. Variations of weight two Hodge structures
enter the construction of the model in an interesting way.
