  The goal of this paper is to analyse the method of angular quantization for
the Sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point, which is one of the most
investigated models of the two-dimensional integrable field theories. The
angular quantization method (see hep-th/9707091) is a continuous analog of the
Baxter's corner transfer matrix method. Investigating the canonical
quantization of the free massive Dirac fermions in one Rindler wedge we
identify this quantization with a representation of the infinite-dimensional
algebra introduced in the paper q-alg/9702002 and specialized to the free
fermion point. We construct further the main ingredients of the SG theory in
terms of the representation theory of this algebra following the approach by
M.Jimbo, T.Miwa et al.
