  An initial step is taken in investigating the duality between the near
horizon region of a four dimensional extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and
the n-particle, N=4 Calogero model as conjectured by Gibbons and Townsend.
Specifically we compute the mass spectrum of d=4, N=8 supergravity about the
Bertotti-Robinson solution and find the corresponding set of conformal
dimensions of states in the dual conformal quantum mechanics. We find that the
dual states fill irreducible representations of the supergroup SU(1,1|2), and
furthermore transform under various irreducible representations of the group
SU(2) \times SU(6) spontaneously broken down from the E_{7(7)} duality group of
N=8 supergravity.
