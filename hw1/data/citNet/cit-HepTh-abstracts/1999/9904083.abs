  It is shown that the effective theory of D-particles has conformal symmetry
with field-dependent parameters. This is a consequence of the supersymmetry.
The string coupling constant is not transformed in contrast with the recent
proposal of generalized conformal symmtery by Jevicki et al. This conformal
symmetry can also be generalized to other Dp-brane systems.
