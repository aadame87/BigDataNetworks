  The radiation-dominated k=0 FRW cosmology emerges as the induced metric on a
codimension one hypersurface of constant extrinsic curvature in the
five-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild solution. That we should get FRW cosmology
in this way is an expected result from AdS/CFT in light of recent comments
regarding the coupling of gravity to "boundary" conformal field theories. I
remark on how this calculation bears on the understanding of Randall and
Sundrum's "alternative to compactification." A generalization of the AdS/CFT
prescription for computing Green's functions is suggested, and it is shown how
gravity emerges from it with a strength G_4 = 2 G_5/L. Some numerical bounds
are set on the radius of curvature L of AdS_5. One of them comes from
estimating the rate of leakage of visible sector energy into the CFT. That rate
is connected via a unitarity relation to deviations from Newton's force law at
short distances. The best bound on L obtained in this paper comes from a match
to the parameters of string theory. It is L < 1 nm if the string scale is 1
GeV. Higher string scales imply a tighter bound on L.
