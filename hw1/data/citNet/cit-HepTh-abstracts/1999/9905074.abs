  The vortex-like solution to the non-linear field equations in a
two-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory with the Chern-Simons mass term is found at
high temperature. It is derived from the effective Lagrangian including the
leading order finite temperature corrections. The discovered field
configuration possesses the finite energy and the quantized magnetic flux. At
the centre of the vortex the point charge is located which is surrounded by the
distributed charge of the opposite sign and the vortex is neutral as a whole.
At high temperature the energy of the vortex is negative and it corresponds to
the ground state. The derived solution is considered to be a result of heating
the lattice vacuum structure formed at zero temperature.
