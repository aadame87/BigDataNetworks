Title: Classical mechanics of relativistic isospin particle

\\
  Classical description of relativistic pointlike particle with intrinsic
degrees of freedom such as isospin or colour is proposed. It is based on the
Lagrangian of general form defined on the tangent bundle over a principal fibre
bundle. It is shown that the dynamics splits into the external dynamics which
describes the interaction of particle with gauge field in terms of Wong
equations, and the internal dynamics which results in a spatial motion of
particle via integrals of motion only. A relevant Hamiltonian description is
built too.
