Title: Universality and conformal invariance for the Ising model in domains
  with boundary
Authors: Robert P. Langlands, Marc-Andre Lewis and Yvan Saint-Aubin
Comments: 96 pages, 57 figures. Revised version. New paragraph added to answer
  questions raised by referee. To appear in J.Stat.Phys. vol 98, issue 1/2
  (2000)
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Statistical Mechanics
\\
  The partition function with boundary conditions for various two-dimensional
Ising models is examined and previously unobserved properties of conformal
invariance and universality are established numerically.
