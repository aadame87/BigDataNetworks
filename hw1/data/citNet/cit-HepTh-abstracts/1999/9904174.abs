  A static, spherically symmetric and purely magnetic solution of the
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton theory, found previously by numerical integration
is shown to obey a system of first order Bogomol'nyi equations. As common for
such equations, there is a tight relation to supersymmetry, in the present case
to the N=4 gauged SU(2)$\times$SU(2) supergravity of Freedman and Schwarz.
Specifically, the dilaton potential of the latter can be avoided by choosing
one of the two gauge coupling constants to be imaginary. It is argued that this
corresponds to a hitherto unknown N=4 gauged SU(2)$\times$SU(1,1) supergravity
in four Euclidean dimensions leading to Bogomol'nyi equations with
asymptotically flat solutions.
