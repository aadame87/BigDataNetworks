  The running gauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential in d-dimensions are
calculated from the explicit solution of d+1-dimensional dilatonic gravity.
This background interpolates between usual AdS in UV and flat space with
singular dilaton in IR and it realizes two-boundaries AdS/CFT correspondence.
The behaviour of running coupling and potential is consistent with results
following from IIB supergravity.
