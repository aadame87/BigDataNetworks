  If the universe is (or a slice of) $AdS_5$ space with 3-branes, the
5-dimensional GUT scale on each brane can be indetified as the 5-dimensional
Planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional Planck scale is generated from the low
4-dimensional GUT scale exponentially in our world.
  The 4-dimensional GUT scales and Planck scale are related to the
5-dimensional GUT scales and Planck scale by exponential factors, respectively.
  One of such scenarios was suggested by Randall and Sundrum recently. We give
another scenario that the 4-dimensional Planck scale is generated from the low
five-dimensional Planck scale by an exponential hierarchy, and the mass scale
in the Standard Model is not rescaled from the 5-dimensional metric to the
4-dimensional metric. We also argue that the additional constant in the
solution might exist, which will rescale the 5-dimensional Planck scale and
affect the physical scale picture. Finally, we embed those compactifications to
the general compactification on $AdS_5$ space and discuss the origin of the
additional constant.
