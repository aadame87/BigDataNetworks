  We study the scattering of three gravitons in M-atrix theory at finite N.
With a specific choice of the background we obtain the complete result up to
two loops. The contributions from three-body forces agree with the ones
presented in recent papers. We extend the calculation and evaluate the two-body
exchanges as well. Such terms, somewhat difficult to isolate and compute, had
been neglected so far in the existing literature. We show that the result we
have obtained from M-atrix theory precisely matches the result from
one-particle reducible tree diagrams in eleven-dimensional supergravity .
