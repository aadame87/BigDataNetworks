Title: Branched Polymers Re-Revisited

  We point out some misconceptions in a recent paper by H. Aoki et al.
[hep-th/9909060]. In particular, the claim that the two-point function of
branched polymers behaves as 1/p^4 instead of 1/p^2 for large p is mistaken and
in no way a precondition for the Hausdorff dimension of branched polymers
having the well known value four.
