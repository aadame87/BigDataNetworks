  We discuss issues related to orientifolds and the brane realization for gauge
theories with orthogonal and symplectic groups. We specifically discuss the
case of theories with (hidden) global SO(2n) symmetry, from three to six
dimensions. We analyze mirror symmetry for three dimensional N=4 gauge
theories, Brane Box Models and six-dimensional gauge theories. We also discuss
the issue of T-duality for D_n space-time singularities. Stuck D branes on ON^0
planes play an interesting role.
