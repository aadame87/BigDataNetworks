Title: Creation of scalar particles in the presence of a constant electric
  field in an anisotropic cosmological universe
Authors: Victor M. Villalba
Comments: 7 pages, REVTEX
\\
  In the present article we analyze the phenomenon of particle creation in a
cosmological anisotropic universe when a constant electric field is present. We
compute, via the Bogoliubov transformations, the density number of particles
created.
