  We consider the effective action for massive two-dimensional QED in flat
Euclidean space-time in the background of a general square-integrable magnetic
field with finite range. It is shown that its small mass limit is controlled by
the chiral anomaly. New results for the low-energy scattering of electrons in
2+1 dimensions in static, inhomogenous magnetic fields are also presented.
