  We describe in detail the techniques needed to compute scattering amplitudes
for colored scalars from the infinite tension limit of bosonic string theory,
up to two loops. These techniques apply both to cubic and quartic interactions,
and to planar as well as non-planar diagrams. The resulting field theories are
naturally defined in the space-time dimension in which they are renormalizable.
With a careful analysis of string moduli space in the Schottky representation
we determine the region of integration for the moduli, which plays a crucial
role in the derivation of the correct combinatorial and color factors for all
diagrams.
