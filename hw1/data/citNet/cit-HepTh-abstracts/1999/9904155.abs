Title: Puzzles on the Duality between Heterotic and Type IIA Strings
Authors: Mitsuko Abe and Masamichi Sato
Comments: Latex, 12 pages, Replacement: solution to puzzles was added, i.e.,
  double K3 fibrations

  We discuss the possibility of the extension of the duality between the webs
of heterotic string and the type IIA string to Calabi-Yau 3-folds with another
K3 fiber by comparing the dual polyhedron of Calabi-Yau 3-folds given by
Candelas, Perevalov and Rajesh.
