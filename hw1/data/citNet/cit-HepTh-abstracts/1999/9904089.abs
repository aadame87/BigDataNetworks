  Non-standard overview on the possible formulation towards a unified model on
the lattice is presented. It is based on the generalized gauge theory which is
formulated by differential forms and thus expected to fit in a simplicial
manifold. We first review suggestive known results towards this direction. As a
small step of concrete realization of the program, we propose a lattice
Chern-Simons gravity theory which leads to the Chern-Simons gravity in the
continuum limit via Ponzano-Regge model. We then summarize the quantization
procedure of the generalized gauge theory and apply the formulation to the
generalized topological Yang-Mills action with instanton gauge fixing. We find
N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with Dirac-K{\"a}hler fermions which are generated
from ghosts via twisting mechanism. The Weinberg-Salam model is formulated by
the generalized Yang-Mills action which includes Connes's non-commutative
geometry formulation as a particular case. In the end a possible scenario to
realize the program is proposed. The formulations given here are by far
incomplete towards the final goal yet include hopeful evidences. This summary
of the overview is the extended version of the talk given at Nishinomiya-Yukawa
memorial symposium (Nishinomiya-city Japan, Nov. 1998).
