  We compare two approaches in supersymmetric confinement, the Seiberg
formulation and the superconvergence rule. For the latter, the critical point
is $\gamma_{00}=0$ in the Landau gauge. We find $4\gamma_{00}=\beta_0$ is the
critical point for most of confining theories without a tree-level
superpotential in the Seiberg formulation, in particular, in the large $N_c$
and $N_f$ limit. We show how confining theories with a discrete symmetry and a
tree-level superpotential connect these two critical points: the large and
small discrete symmetry limits correspond to the critical points
$4\gamma_{00}=\beta_0$ and $\gamma_{00}=0$, respectively.
