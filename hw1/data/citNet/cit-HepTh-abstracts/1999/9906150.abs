  To formulate two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matter fields in
the large-N limit as classical mechanics, we derive a Poisson algebra for the
color-invariant observables involving adjoint matter fields. We showed
rigorously in J. Math. Phys. 40, 1870 (1999) that different quantum orderings
of the observables produce essentially the same Poisson algebra. Here we
explain, in a less precise but more pedagogical manner, the crucial topological
graphical observations underlying the formal proof.
