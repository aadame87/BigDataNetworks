  We find the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor in the CFT
corresponding to a moving black hole in AdS. Boosting the black hole to the
speed of light, keeping the total energy fixed, yields a gravitational shock
wave in AdS. The analogous procedure on the field theory side leads to ``light
cone'' states, i.e., states with energy-momentum tensor localized on the light
cone. The correspondence between the gravitational shock wave and these light
cone states provides a useful tool for testing causality. We show, in several
examples, how the CFT reproduces the causal relations in AdS.
