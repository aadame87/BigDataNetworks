  Characters and linear combinations of characters that admit a fermionic sum
representation as well as a factorized form are considered for some minimal
Virasoro models. As a consequence, various Rogers-Ramanujan type identities are
obtained. Dilogarithm identities producing corresponding effective central
charges and secondary effective central charges are derived. Several ways of
constructing more general fermionic representations are discussed.
