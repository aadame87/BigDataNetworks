  We review some of the uses of Whitham hierarchies in the context of the
theory of the prepotential in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories. We focus on
the structure of the contact terms in the twisted topological theory, and on
the connection between Whitham hierarchies and the u-plane integrals for higher
rank gauge groups, trying to put together the different approaches involved in
this connection. We also review two other uses of the Whitham hierarchies: the
interpretation of the slow times as supersymmetry breaking parameters, and the
new techniques to extract instanton corrections using the RG equations written
in terms of theta functions.
