Title: Relativistic Partial Wave Analysis Using the Velocity Basis of the
  Poincare Group
Authors: A. Bohm, H. Kaldass
Comments: 14 pages; revtex
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematical Physics
\\
  The velocity basis of the Poincare group is used in the direct product space
of two irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. The velocity
basis with total angular momentum j will be used for the definition of
relativistic Gamow vectors.
