  Quantum mechanics on the moduli space of N supersymmetric Reissner-Nordstrom
black holes is shown to admit 4 supersymmetries using an unconventional
supermultiplet which contains 3N bosons and 4N fermions. A near-horizon limit
is found in which the quantum mechanics of widely separated black holes
decouples from that of strongly-interacting, near-coincident black holes. This
near-horizon theory is shown to have an enhanced D(2,1;0) superconformal
symmetry. The bosonic symmetries are SL(2,R) conformal symmetry and SU(2)xSU(2)
R-symmetry arising from spatial rotations and the R-symmetry of N=2
supergravity.
