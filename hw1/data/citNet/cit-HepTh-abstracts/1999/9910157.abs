  Without a gauge fixing, canonical variables for the light-front SU(2)
gluodynamics are determined. The Gauss law is written in terms of the canonical
variables. The system is qualified as a generalized dynamical system with first
class constraints. Abeliazation is a specific feature of the formulation (most
of the canonical variables transform nontrivially only under the action of an
Abelian subgroup of the gauge transformations). At finite volume, a discrete
spectrum of the light-front Hamiltonian $P_+$ is obtained in the sector of
vanishing $P_-$. We obtain, therefore, a quantized form of the classical
solutions previously known as non-Abelian plane waves. Then, considering the
infinite volume limit, we find that the presence of the mass gap depends on the
way the infinite volume limit is taken, which may suggest the presence of
different ``phases'' of the infinite volume theory. We also check that the
formulation obtained is in accord with the standard perturbation theory if the
latter is taken in the covariant gauges.
