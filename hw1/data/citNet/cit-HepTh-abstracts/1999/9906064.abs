  Conventional wisdom states that Newton's force law implies only four
non-compact dimensions. We demonstrate that this is not necessarily true in the
presence of a non-factorizable background geometry. The specific example we
study is a single 3-brane embedded in five dimensions. We show that even
without a gap in the Kaluza-Klein spectrum, four-dimensional Newtonian and
general relativistic gravity is reproduced to more than adequate precision.
