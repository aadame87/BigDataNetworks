  We obtain the orbifold Virasoro master equation (OVME) at integer order
lambda, which summarizes the general Virasoro construction on orbifold affine
algebra. The OVME includes the Virasoro master equation when lambda=1 and
contains large classes of stress tensors of twisted sectors of conventional
orbifolds at higher lambda. The generic construction is like a twisted sector
of an orbifold (with non-zero ground state conformal weight) but new
constructions are obtained for which we have so far found no conventional
orbifold interpretation.
