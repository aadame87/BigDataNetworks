  The search for intersecting brane solutions in supergravity is a large and
profitable industry. Recently, attention has focused on finding localized forms
of known `delocalized' solutions. However, in some cases, a localized version
of the delocalized solution simply does not exist. Instead, localized separated
branes necessarily delocalize as the separation is removed. This phenomenon is
related to black hole no-hair theorems, i.e. `baldness.' We continue the
discussion of this effect and describe how it can be understood, in the case of
Dirichlet branes, in terms of the corresponding intersection field theory. When
it occurs, it is associated with the quantum mixing of phases and lack of
superselection sectors in low dimensional field theories. We find surprisingly
wide agreement between the field theory and supergravity both with respect to
which examples delocalize and with respect to the rate at which this occurs.
