  Simple derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for bosonic strings and
p-branes is given. The motion of classical strings and p-branes is described by
two and p+1 local fields, respectively. A variety of local field equations
which reduce to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the classical limit are given.
They are essentially nonlinear, having no linear term.
