  We show how turning on Flux for RR (and NS-NS) field strengths on non-compact
Calabi-Yau 3-folds can serve as a way to partially break supersymmetry from N=2
to N=1 by mass deformation. The freezing of the moduli of Calabi-Yau in the
presence of the flux is the familiar phenomenon of freezing of fields in
supersymmetric theories upon mass deformations.
