  In supersymmetric models with the run-away vacua or with the stable but
non-supersymmetric ground state there exist stable field configurations (vacua)
which restore one half of supersymmetry and are characterized by constant
positive energy density. The formal foundation for such vacua is provided by
the central extension of the N =1 superalgebra with the infinite central
charge.
