  A relation between the total instanton number and the quantum-numbers of
magnetic monopoles that arise in general Abelian gauges in SU(2) Yang-Mills
theory is established. The instanton number is expressed as the sum of the
`twists' of all monopoles, where the twist is related to a generalized Hopf
invariant. The origin of a stronger relation between instantons and monopoles
in the Polyakov gauge is discussed.
