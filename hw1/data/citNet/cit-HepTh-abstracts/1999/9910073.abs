  By means of the geometric algebra the general decomposition of SU(2) gauge
potential on the sphere bundle of a compact and oriented 4-dimensional manifold
is given. Using this decomposition theory the SU(2) Chern density has been
studied in detail. It shows that the SU(2) Chern density can be expressed in
terms of the $\delta -$function $\delta (\phi) $. And one can find that the
zero points of the vector fields $\phi$ are essential to the topological
properties of a manifold. It is shown that there exists the crucial case of
branch process at the zero points. Based on the implicit function theorem and
the taylor expansion, the bifurcation of the Chern density is detailed in the
neighborhoods of the bifurcation points of $\phi$. It is pointed out that,
since the Chren density is a topological invariant, the sum topological
chargers of the branches will remain constant during the bifurcation process.
