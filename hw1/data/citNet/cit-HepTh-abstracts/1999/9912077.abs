Title: Symmetry-deforming interactions of chiral p-forms
Authors: Xavier Bekaert, Marc Henneaux, and Alexander Sevrin
Comments: 7 pages, tiny typo corrections, based on a talk given by M. H. at the
  conference "Constrained Dynamics and Quantum Gravity " held in Villasimius
  (Sardinia), September 13-17 1999, to appear in the proceedings of the meeting
  (Nucl. Phys. B Proc. Suppl.)
Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 88 (2000) 27-33
\\
  No-go theorems on gauge-symmetry-deforming interactions of chiral p-forms are
reviewed. We consider the explicit case of p=4, D=10 and show that the only
symmetry-deforming consistent vertex for a system of one chiral 4-form and two
2-forms is the one that occurs in the type II B supergravity Lagrangian.
