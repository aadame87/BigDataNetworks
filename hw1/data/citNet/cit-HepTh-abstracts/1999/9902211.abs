  Continuing the investigation of CNM (chiral-nonminimal) hypermultiplet
nonlinear sigma-models, we propose extensions of the concept of the c-map which
relate holomorphic functions to hyper-Kahler geometries. In particular, we show
that a whole series of hyper-Kahler potentials can be derived by replacing the
role of the 4D, N = 1 tensor multiplet in the original c-map by 4D, N = 1
non-minimal multiplets and auxiliary superfields. The resulting N = 2 models
appear to have interesting connections to Calabi-Yau manifolds and algebraic
varieties. These models also emphasize the fact that special hyper-Kahler
manifolds (the analogs of special Kahler manifolds) without isometries exist.
