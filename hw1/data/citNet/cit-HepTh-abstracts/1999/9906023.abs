  We study the low-energy effective theory of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory with ADE gauge groups in view of the spectral curves of the periodic
Toda lattice and the A-D-E singularity theory. We examine the exact solutions
by using the Picard-Fuchs equations for the period integrals of the
Seiberg-Witten differential. In particular, we find that the superconformal
fixed point in the strong coupling region of the Coulomb branch is
characterized by the ADE superpotential. We compute the scaling exponents,
which agree with the previous results.
