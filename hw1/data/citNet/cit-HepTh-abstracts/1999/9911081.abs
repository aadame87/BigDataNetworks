  We show how chiral type I models whose tadpole conditions have no
supersymmetric solution can be consistently defined introducing antibranes with
non-supersymmetric world volumes. At tree level, the resulting stable non-BPS
configurations correspond to tachyon-free spectra, where supersymmetry is
broken at the string scale on some (anti)branes but is exact in the bulk, and
can be further deformed by the addition of brane-antibrane pairs of the same
type. As a result, a scalar potential is generated, that can stabilize some
radii of the compact space. This setting has the novel virtue of linking
supersymmetry breaking to the consistency requirements of an underlying
fundamental theory.
