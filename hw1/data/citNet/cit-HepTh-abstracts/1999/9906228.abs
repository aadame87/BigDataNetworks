  A general calculation of Casimir energies --in an arbitrary number of
dimensions-- for massless quantized fields in spherically symmetric cavities is
carried out. All the most common situations, including scalar and spinor
fields, the electromagnetic field, and various boundary conditions are treated
with care. The final results are given as analytical (closed) expressions in
terms of Barnes zeta functions. A direct, straightforward numerical evaluation
of the formulas is then performed, which yields highly accurate numbers of, in
principle, arbitrarily good precision.
