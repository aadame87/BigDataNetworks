  An abstract formulation of quantum dynamics in the presence of a general set
of quantum constraints is developed. Our constructive procedure is such that
the relevant projection operator onto the physical Hilbert space is obtained
with a single, common integration procedure over the original Lagrange
multiplier variables that is completely independent of the general nature of
the constraints. In the associated lattice-limit formulation it is demonstrated
that expansion of the constraint operator contribution to second order in the
lattice spacing is necessary while, as usual, only a first-order expansion is
needed for the dynamical operator contribution. Among various possibilities,
coherent state path integrals are used to illustrate a completely functional
representation of the abstract quantization procedure.
