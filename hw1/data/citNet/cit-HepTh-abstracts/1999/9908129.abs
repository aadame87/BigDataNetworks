  We discuss the possibility that the electro-weak and strong interactions
arise as the low energy effective description of branes in M-theory. As a step
towards constructing such a model we show how one can naturally obtain
SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2)\times U(1) gauge theories from branes, including matter
in the bi-fundamental representation of SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2) which are
fractionally charged under U(1).
