Title: Minimal Supersymmetric CPN Models
Authors: K.J. Barnes
Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys. B575 (2000) 397-400
\\
  Supersymmetric CPN models based on underlying bosonic Kahler manifolds have
not been thought to arise directly from constrained linear ones. A
counterexample for N=4 is presented using improved understanding of membranes
in superstring theories leading to crucial central terms modifying the algebra
of supercharge densities. The example has an immediate extension to all higher
N.
