  We consider the free field approach or bosonization technique for the
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model with arbitrary Kac-Moody algebra on Riemann
surface of genus zero. This subject was much studied previously, and the paper
can be partially taken as a brief survey. The way to obtain well-known
Schechtman-Varchenko solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations as
certain correlators in free chiral theory is revisited. This gives rise to
simple description of space of the WZNW conformal blocks. The general $N$-point
correlators of the model are constructed from the conformal blocks using
non-chiral action for free fields perturbed by exactly marginal terms. The
method involved generalizes the Dotsenko-Fateev prescription for minimal
models. As a consequence of this construction we obtain new integral
identities.
