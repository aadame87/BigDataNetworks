  Open systems acquire time-dependent coupling constants through interaction
with an external field or environment. We generalize the Lewis-Riesenfeld
invariant theorem to open system of quantum fields after second quantization.
The generalized invariants and thereby the quantum evolution are found
explicitly for time-dependent quadratic fermionic systems. The pair production
of fermions is computed and other physical implications are discussed.
