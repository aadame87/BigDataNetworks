  We study dynamics of a probe p-brane and a test particle in the field
background of fully localized solutions describing the source p-brane within
the worldvolume of the source domain wall. We find that the probe dynamics in
the background of the source p-brane in one lower dimensions is not reproduced,
indicating that p-branes within the worldvolume of domain walls perhaps
describe an exotic phase of p-branes in brane worlds. We speculate therefore
that a (p+1)-brane where one of its longitudinal directions is along the
direction transverse to the domain wall is the right description of the p-brane
in the brane world with the expected properties.
