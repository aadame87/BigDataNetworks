  A constant homogeneous magnetic field is applied to a composite system made
of two scalar particles with opposite charges. Motion is described by a pair of
coupled Klein-Gordon equations that are written in closed form with help of a
suitable representation. The relativistic symmetry associated with the magnetic
field is carefully respected. Considering eigenstates of the pseudo momentum
four-vector, we separate out collective variables and obtain a 3- dimensional
reduced equation, posing a nonconventional eigenvalue problem. The velocity of
the system as a whole generates "motional" terms in the formulas these terms
are taken into account within a manifestly covariant framework.
