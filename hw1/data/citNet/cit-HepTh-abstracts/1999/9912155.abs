  An analogy is noted between RG flow equations in 4-dimensional gauge theory,
as derived from the AdS/CFT correspondence, and the RG flow equations in
4-dimensional field theory coupled to a particular limit of Weyl supergravity.
This suggests a possible theory of dynamical 3-branes with fluctuating
4-dimensional conformal factor. The argument involves a map from flows in
4-dimensional gauge theories to flows in a class of 2-dimensional sigma models.
