  In M-theory on $S^1/Z_2$, we point out that to be consistant, we should keep
the scale, gauge couplings and soft terms at next order, and obtain the soft
term relations: $M_{1/2} = -A$, $|{{M_{0}}/{M_{1/2}}}| \leq {1/{\sqrt 3}}$ in
the standard embedding and $M_{1/2}=-A$ in the non-standard embedding with five
branes and $K_{5,n}=0$. We construct a toy compactification model which
includes higher order terms in 4-dimensional Lagrangian in standard embedding,
and discuss its scale, gauge couplings, soft terms, and show that the higher
order terms do affect the scale, gauge couplings and especially the soft terms
if the next order correction was not small. We also construct a toy
compactification model in non-standard embedding with five branes and discuss
its phenomenology. We argue that one might not push the physical Calabi-Yau
manifold's volume to zero at any point along the eleventh dimension.
