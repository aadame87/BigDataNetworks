Title: Confining N=1 SUSY gauge theories from Seiberg duality
Authors: Matthias Klein
Comments: 8 pages, Latex, to appear in the proceedings of the Trieste Meeting
  of the TMR Network on Physics beyond the SM (Feb 24-27, 1999)

  In this talk I review and generalize an idea of Seiberg that an N=1
supersymmetric gauge theory shows confinement without breaking of chiral
symmetry when the gauge symmetry of its magnetic dual is completely broken by
the Higgs effect. It is shown how the confining spectrum of a supersymmetric
gauge theory can easily be derived when a magnetic dual is known and this
method is applied to many models containing fields in second rank tensor
representations and an appropriate tree-level superpotential.
