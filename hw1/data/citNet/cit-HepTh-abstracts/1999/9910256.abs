  We propose a gauge invariant formulation of the exact renormalization group
equation for nonsupersymmetric pure U(N) Yang-Mills theory, based on the
construction by Tim Morris. In fact we show that our renormalization group
equation amounts to a regularized version of the loop equation, thereby
providing a direct relation between the exact renormalization group and the
Schwinger-Dyson equations. We also discuss a possible implication of our
formulation to the holographic correspondence of the bulk gravity and the
boundary gauge theory.
