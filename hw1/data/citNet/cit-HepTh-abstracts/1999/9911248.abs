  The Casimir energy of a non-uniform string built up from two pieces with
different speed of sound is calculated. A standard procedure of subtracting the
energy of an infinite uniform string is applied, the subtraction being
interpreted as the renormalization of the string tension. It is shown that in
the case of a homogeneous string this method is completely equivalent to the
zeta renormalization.
