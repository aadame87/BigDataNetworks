  We discuss the weak gravitational field created by isolated matter sources in
the Randall-Sundrum brane-world. In the case of two branes of opposite tension,
linearized Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity is recovered on either wall, with different
BD parameters. On the wall with positive tension the BD parameter is larger
than 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than 4 times the
AdS radius. For the wall of negative tension, the BD parameter is always
negative but greater than -3/2. In either case, shadow matter from the other
wall gravitates upon us. For equal Newtonian mass, light deflection from shadow
matter is 25 % weaker than from ordinary matter. Hence, the effective mass of a
clustered object containing shadow dark matter would be underestimated if
naively measured through its lensing effect. For the case of a single wall of
positive tension, Einstein gravity is recovered on the wall to leading order,
and if the source is stationary the field stays localized near the wall. We
calculate the leading Kaluza-Klein corrections to the linearized gravitational
field of a non-relativistic spherical object and find that the metric is
different from the Schwarzschild solution at large distances. We believe that
our linearized solution corresponds to the field far from the horizon after
gravitational collapse of matter on the brane.
