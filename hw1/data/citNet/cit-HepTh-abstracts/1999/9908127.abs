  A method is developed to construct the solutions of one and many variable,
linear differential equations of arbitrary order. Using this, the $N$-particle
Sutherland model, with pair-wise inverse sine-square interactions among the
particles, is shown to be equivalent to free particles on a circle.
Applicability of our method to many other few and many-body problems is also
illustrated.
