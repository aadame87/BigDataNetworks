  In a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), Saveliev and the author showed that there
exits an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the field
equations reduces to a (super) version of Yang's equations which may be solved
by methods inspired by the ones previously developed for self-dual Yang-Mills
equations in four dimensions. Later on (hep-th/9903218), the analogy between
these latter theories and the present ones was pushed further by writing down a
set of super partial linear differential equations which are the analogues of
the Lax pair of Belavin and Zakharov. Using this Lax representation, it is
shown in the present article that solution-generating techniques are at work,
which are similar to the ones developed for four dimensional self-dual
Yang-Mills theories in the late seventies.
