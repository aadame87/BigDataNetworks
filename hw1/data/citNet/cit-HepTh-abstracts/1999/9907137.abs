  We introduce a general method in order to construct the non chiral fusion
rules which determine the operator content of the operator product algebra for
rational conformal field theories. We are particularly interested in the models
of the complementary D-like solutions of modular invariant partition functions
with cyclic center Zn. We find that the non chiral fusion rules have a
Zn-grading structure.
