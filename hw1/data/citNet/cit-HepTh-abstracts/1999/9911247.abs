\\
  The K\"ahler-Dirac equation is derived on the Weitzenb\"ock space-time, which
has a quadruplet of parallel vector fields as the fundamental structure. A
consistent system of equations for the K\"ahler fields and parallel vector
fields is obtained.
  Key words: teleparallelism, fermions, internal symmetry, equations.
