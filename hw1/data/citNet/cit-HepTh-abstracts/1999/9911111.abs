  The relative entropy of the massive free bosonic field theory is studied on
various compact Riemann surfaces as a universal quantity with physical
significance, in particular, for gravitational phenomena. The exact expression
for the sphere is obtained, as well as its asymptotic series for large mass and
its Taylor series for small mass. One can also derive exact expressions for the
torus but not for higher genus. However, the asymptotic behaviour for large
mass can always be established-up to a constant-with heat-kernel methods. It
consists of an asymptotic series determined only by the curvature, hence common
for homogeneous surfaces of genus higher than one, and exponentially vanishing
corrections whose form is determined by the concrete topology. The coefficient
of the logarithmic term in this series gives the conformal anomaly.
