  Zero-point fluctuations in quantum fields give rise to observable forces
between material bodies, the so-called Casimir forces. In these lectures I
present the theory of the Casimir effect, primarily formulated in terms of
Green's functions. There is an intimate relation between the Casimir effect and
van der Waals forces. Applications to conductors and dielectric bodies of
various shapes will be given for the cases of scalar, electromagnetic, and
fermionic fields. The dimensional dependence of the effect will be described.
Finally, we ask the question: Is there a connection between the Casimir effect
and the phenomenon of sonoluminescence?
