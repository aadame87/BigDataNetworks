  We consider the canonical quantization of fermions on an odd dimensional
manifold with boundary, with respect to a family of elliptic hermitean boundary
conditions for the Dirac hamiltonian. We show that there is a topological
obstruction to a smooth quantization as a function of the boundary conditions.
The obstruction is given in terms of a gerbe and its Dixmier-Douady class is
evaluated.
