Title: Does black hole radiance break supersymmetry ?
Authors: Parthasarathi Majumdar (Inst. of Math. Sc., Chennai, India)
Comments: 6 pages Revtex, no figures, minor changes in sections III and V
\\
  Arguments presented in an earlier paper, demonstrating the breakdown of
global supersymmetry in Hawking radiation from a generic four dimensional black
hole with infalling massless scalar and spinor particles, are reexamined.
Careful handling of the Grassmann-valued spinorial parameter is shown to lead
to a situation wherein supersymmetry may not actually break. A comparative
analysis in flat spacetime at a finite temperature, is also presented.
