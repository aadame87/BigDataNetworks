  In this brief note we construct the propagator for the antisymmetric tensor
in AdS_{d+1}. We check our result using the Poincare duality between the
antisymmetric tensor and the gauge boson in AdS_5. This propagator was needed
for a computation which turned out to be too hard. It can be used for computing
various other things in AdS.
