  Generalized Yang-Mills theories have a covariant derivative that employs both
scalar and vector bosons. Here we show how grand unified theories of the
electroweak and strong interactions can be constructed with them. In particular
the SU(5) GUT can be obtained from SU(6) with SU(5)xU(1) as a maximal subgroup.
The choice of maximal subgroup also determines the chiral structure of the
theory. The resulting Lagrangian has only two terms, and only two irreducible
representations are needed, one for fermions and another for bosons.
