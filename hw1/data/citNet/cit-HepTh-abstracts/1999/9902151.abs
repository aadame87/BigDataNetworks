  We discuss the determination of the lowest Form Factors relative to the trace
operators of N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon Model. Analytic continuations of these Form
Factors as functions of the coupling constant allows us to study a series of
models in a uniform way, among these the latest model of the Roaming Series and
a class of minimal supersymmetric models.
