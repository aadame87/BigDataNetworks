  It is shown using both conventional and algebraic approach to quantum field
theory that it is impossible to perform quantization on Unruh modes in
Minkowski spacetime. Such quantization implies setting boundary condition for
the quantum field operator which changes topological properties and symmetry
group of spacetime and leads to field theory in two disconnected left and right
Rindler spacetimes. It means that "Unruh effect" does not exist.
