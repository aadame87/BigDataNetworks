  Gorsky et al. presented an explicit construction of Whitham deformations of
the Seiberg-Witten curve for the $SU(N+1)$ $\calN = 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory.
We extend their result to all classical gauge groups and some other cases such
as the spectral curve of the $A^{(2)}_{2N}$ affine Toda Toda system. Our
construction, too, uses fractional powers of the superpotential $W(x)$ that
characterizes the curve. We also consider the $u$-plane integral of
topologically twisted theories on four-dimensional manifolds $X$ with
$b_2^{+}(X) = 1$ in the language of these explicitly constructed Whitham
deformations and an integrable hierarchy of the KdV type hidden behind.
