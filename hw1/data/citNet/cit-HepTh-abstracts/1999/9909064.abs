  A superspace formulation is proposed for the osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian
quantization of general massive gauge theories. The superalgebra os0(1,2) is
considered as subalgebra of sl(1,2); the latter may be considered as the
algebra of generators of the conformal group in a superspace with two
anticommuting coordinates. The mass-dependent (anti)BRST symmetries of proper
solutions of the quantum master equations in the osp(1,2)-covariant formalism
are realized in that superspace as invariance under translations combined with
mass-dependent special conformal transformations. The Sp(2) symmetry - in
particular the ghost number conservation - and the "new ghost number"
conservation are realized as invariance under symplectic rotations and
dilatations, respectively. The transformations of the gauge fields - and of the
full set of necessarily required (anti)ghost and auxiliary fields - under the
superalgebra sl(1,2) are determined both for irreducible and first-stage
reducible theories with closed gauge algebra.
