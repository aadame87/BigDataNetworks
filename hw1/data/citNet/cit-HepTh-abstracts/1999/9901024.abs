  A review is made on some recent studies which support the point of view that
the relativistic field theory quantized on the light-front (LF) is more
transparent compared to the conventional equal-time one. The discussion may be
of relevance in the context of the quantization of gravitation theory. The LF
quantization is argued to be equally appropriate as the conventional equal-time
one. The description on the LF of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the
(tree level) Higgs mechanism, the emergence of the $\theta$-vacua in the
Schwinger model, the absence of such vacua in the Chiral SM, the BRS-BFT
quantization of the latter on the LF are among the topics discussed. Comments
on the irrelevance, in the quantized theory, of the fact that the hyperplanes
$x^{\pm}=0$ constitute characteristic surfaces of the hyperbolic partial
differential equation are also made. The LF theory quantized on, say, the
$x^{+}=const.$ hyperplanes seems to already contain in it the information on
the equal-$x^{-}$ commutators as well. A theoretical reaffirmation of that the
experimental data is to be confronted with the predictions of a classical
theory model only after it has been upgraded through its quantization seems to
emerge.
