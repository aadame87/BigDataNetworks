  We continue McCartor and Robertson's recent demonstration of the
indispensability of ghost fields in the light-cone gauge quantization of gauge
fields. It is shown that the ghost fields are indispensable in deriving
well-defined antiderivatives and in regularizing the most singular component of
gauge field propagator. To this end it is sufficient to confine ourselves to
noninteracting abelian fields. Furthermore to circumvent dealing with
constrained systems, we construct the temporal gauge canonical formulation of
the free electromagnetic field in auxiliary coordinates
$x^{\mu}=(x^-,x^+,x^1,x^2)$ where $x^-=x^0 cos{\theta}-x^3 sin{\theta}, x^+=x^0
sin{\theta}+x^3 cos{\theta}$ and $x^-$ plays the role of time. In so doing we
can quantize the fields canonically without any constraints, unambiguously
introduce "static ghost fields" as residual gauge degrees of freedom and
construct the light-cone gauge solution in the light-cone representation by
simply taking the light-cone limit (${\theta}\to \pi/4$). As a by product we
find that, with a suitable choice of vacuum the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt form of
the propagator can be derived in the ${\theta}=0$ case (the temporal gauge
formulation in the equal-time representation).
