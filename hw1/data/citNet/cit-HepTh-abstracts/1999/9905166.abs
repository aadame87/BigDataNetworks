  Topological terms in the O(3) nonlinear sigma model in (1+1) and (2+1)
dimensions are re-examined based on the description of the SU(2)-valued field
$g$. We first show that the topological soliton term in (1+1) dimensions arises
from the unitary representations of the group characterizing the global
structure of the symmetry inherent in the description, in a manner analogous to
the appearance of the $\theta$-term in Yang-Mills theory in (3+1) dimensions.
We then present a detailed argument as to why the conventional Hopf term, which
is the topological counterpart in (2+1) dimensions and has been widely used to
realize fractional spin and statistics, is ill-defined unless the soliton
charge vanishes. We show how this restriction can be lifted by means of a
procedure proposed recently, and provide its physical interpretation as well.
