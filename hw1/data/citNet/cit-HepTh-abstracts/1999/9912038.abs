  We derive the noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld action for the $D$-brane,
which governs dynamics of $D$-brane with a NS-NS $B$-field in the low energy
regime. Depending on some details of the path integral prescriptions, both
ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld action and noncommutative one can be obtained by
evaluating the same Polyakov string path integral for the open string ending on
the $D$-brane. Thus, it establishes the equivalence of the noncommutative
Dirac-Born-Infeld action and the ordinary one.
