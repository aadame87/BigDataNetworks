Title: Super-p-brane actions from interpolating dualisations
Authors: Anders Westerberg and Niclas Wyllard
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX2e. Based on talks given by A.W. at QFTHEP'99, Moscow,
  27 May-2 June 1999, and at the Third annual meeting of the EU TMR network
  `Quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification', Paris,
  1-7 September 1999

  We review a recently proposed method for constructing super-p-brane
world-volume actions. In this approach, starting from a democratic choice of
world-volume gauge-fields guided by p-brane intersection rules, the
requirements of kappa-symmetry and gauge invariance can be used to determine
the corresponding action. We discuss the application of the method to some
cases of interest, notably the (p,q)-5-branes of type-IIB string theory in a
manifestly S-duality covariant formulation.
