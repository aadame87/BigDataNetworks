  Using AdS/CFT correspondence we found the conformal anomaly from d3 and d5
gauged supergravity with single scalar (dilaton) and the arbitrary scalar
potential on AdS-like scalar-gravitational background. Such dilatonic gravity
action describes the special RG flows in extended gauged SG when scalars lie in
one-dimensional submanifold of complete scalars space. This dilaton-dependent
conformal anomaly corresponds to dual non-conformal (gauge) QFT (which is
classically conformally invariant) with account of radiative corrections.
Equations of motion in d5 gauged supergravity put some restrictions to the
dilatonic potential on the conformal boundary. Using these restrictions we
propose the candidate c-functions away from exact conformity. These c-functions
are positively defined and monotonic, expressed in terms of dilatonic potential
and have the fixed points in asymptotically AdS region.
