  Gauging of space translations for nonrelativistic point particles in one
dimension leads to general coordinate transformations with fixed Newtonian
time. The minimal gauge invariant extension of the particle velocity requires
the introduction of two gauge fields whose minimal self interaction leads to a
Maxwellian term in the Lagrangean. No dilaton field is introduced. We fix the
gauge such that the residual symmetry group is the Galilei group. In case of a
line the two-particle reduced Lagrangean describes the motion in a Newtonian
gravitational potential with strength proportional to the energy. For particles
on a circle with certain initial conditions we only have a collective rotation
with constant angular velocity.
