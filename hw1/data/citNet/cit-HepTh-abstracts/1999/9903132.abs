  We determine the thermodynamic stability conditions for near-extreme rotating
D3, M5, and M2-branes with multiple angular momenta. Critical exponents near
the boundary of stability are discussed and compared with a naive field theory
model. From a partially numerical computation we conclude that outside the
boundary of stability, the angular momentum density tends to become spatially
inhomogeneous.
  Periodic Euclidean spinning brane solutions have been studied as models of
QCD. We explain how supersymmetry is restored in the world-volume field theory
in the limit of large spin and discuss the hierarchy of energy scales that
develops as this limit is approached.
