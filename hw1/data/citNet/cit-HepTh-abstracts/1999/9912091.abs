  We construct a deformation of the quantum algebra Fun(T^*G) associated with
Lie group G to the case where G is replaced by a quantum group G_q which has a
bicovariant calculus. The deformation easily allows for the inclusion of the
current algebra of left and right invariant one forms. We use it to examine a
possible generalization of the Gauss law commutation relations for gauge
theories based on G_q.
