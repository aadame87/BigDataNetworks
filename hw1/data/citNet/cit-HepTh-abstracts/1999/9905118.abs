  We study the embedding of D(8-p)-branes in the background geometry of
parallel Dp-branes for $p\le 6$. The D(8-p)-brane is extended along the
directions orthogonal to the Dp-branes of the background. The D(8-p)-brane
configuration is determined by its Dirac-Born-Infeld plus Wess-Zumino-Witten
action. We find a BPS condition which solves the equation of motion. The
analytical solution of the BPS equation for the near-horizon and asymptotically
flat geometries is given. The embeddings we obtain represent branes joined by
tubes. By analyzing the energy of these tubes we conclude that they can be
regarded as bundles of fundamental strings. Our solution provides an explicit
realization of the Hanany-Witten effect. When $p=6$ the solution of the BPS
equation must be considered separately and, in general, the embeddings of the
D2-branes do not admit the same interpretation as in the $p<6$ case.
