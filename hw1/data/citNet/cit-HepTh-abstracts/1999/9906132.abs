  A model, based on a noncommutative geometry, unifying general relativity with
quantum mechanics, is further develped. It is shown that the dynamics in this
model can be described in terms of one-parameter groups of random operators. It
is striking that the noncommutative counterparts of the concept of state and
that of probability measure coincide. We also demonstrate that the equation
describing noncommutative dynamics in the quantum gravitational approximation
gives the standard unitary evolution of observables, and in the "space-time
limit" it leads to the state vector reduction. The cases of the spin and
position operators are discussed in details.
