  Vacuum spherically symmetric Einstein gravity in $N\ge 4$ dimensions can be
cast in a two-dimensional conformal nonlinear sigma model form by first
integrating on the $(N-2)$-dimensional (hyper)sphere and then performing a
canonical transformation. The conformal sigma model is described by two fields
which are related to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass and to the radius of the
$(N-2)$-dimensional (hyper)sphere, respectively. By quantizing perturbatively
the theory we estimate the quantum corrections to the ADM mass of a black hole.
