  De Sitter spacetime is known to have a cosmological horizon that enjoys
thermodynamic-like properties similar to those of a black hole horizon. In this
note we show that a universal argument can be given for the entropy of de
Sitter spacetime in arbitrary dimensions, by generalizing a recent near horizon
symmetry plus conformal field theory argument of Carlip for black hole entropy.
The implications of this argument are also discussed.
