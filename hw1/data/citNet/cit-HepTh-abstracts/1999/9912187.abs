  We study local and global gravitational effects of (D-2)-brane configurations
(domain-walls) in the vacuum of D-dimensional space-time. We focus on
infinitely thin vacuum domain walls with arbitrary cosmological constants on
either side of the wall. In the comoving frame of the wall we derive a general
metric Ansatz, consistent with the homogeneity and isotropy of the space-time
intrinsic to the wall, and employ Israel's matching conditions at the wall. The
space-time, intrinsic to the wall, is that of (D-1)-dimensional
Freedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe (with k=-1,0,1) which has a (local)
description as either anti-deSitter, Minkowski or deSitter space-time. For each
of these geometries, we provide a systematic classification of the local and
global space-time structure transverse to the walls, for those with both
positive and negative tension; they fall into different classes according to
the values of their energy density relative to that of the extreme
(superysmmetric) configurations. We find that in any dimension D, both local
and global space-time structure for each class of domain-walls is universal. We
also comment on the phenomenological implications of these walls in the special
case of D=5.
