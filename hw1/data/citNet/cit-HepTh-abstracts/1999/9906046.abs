  We discuss local mirror symmetry for higher-genus curves. Specifically, we
consider the topological string partition function of higher-genus curves
contained in a Fano surface within a Calabi-Yau. Our main example is the local
P^2 case. The Kodaira-Spencer theory of gravity, tailored to this local
geometry, can be solved to compute this partition function. Then, using the
results of Gopakumar and Vafa and the local mirror map, the partition function
can be rewritten in terms of expansion coefficients, which are found to be
integers. We verify, through localization calculations in the A-model, many of
these Gromov-Witten predictions. The integrality is a mystery, mathematically
speaking. The asymptotic growth (with degree) of the invariants is analyzed.
Some suggestions are made towards an enumerative interpretation, following the
BPS-state description of Gopakumar and Vafa.
