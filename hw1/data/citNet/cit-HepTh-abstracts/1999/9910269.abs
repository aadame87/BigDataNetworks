  Black hole production in the collision of ultra-relativistic particles in the
brane-world approach is considered. In particular, stability of the brane under
collision with ultra-relativistic particles is discussed. As a toy model we
consider the 3 dimensional version of the Randall and Sundrum solution and show
that stability of the brane depends on a choice of continuation of the solution
across the horizon. In the unstable case black holes can be produced in the
collision of a particle with the brane.
