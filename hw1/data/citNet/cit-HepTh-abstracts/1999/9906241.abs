  Solution is presented to the simplest problem about the vacuum backreaction
on a pair creating source. The backreaction effect is nonanalytic in the
coupling constant and restores completely the energy conservation law. The
vacuum changes the kinematics of motion like relativity theory does and imposes
a new upper bound on the velocity of the source.
