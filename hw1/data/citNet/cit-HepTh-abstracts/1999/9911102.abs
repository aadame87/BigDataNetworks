Title: A small but nonzero cosmological constant
Authors: Y. Jack Ng and H. van Dam (University of North Carolina)
Comments: A discussion on the form of the cosmological constant (inversely
  proportional to the square of the cosmic scale factor) after the epoch
  corresponding to the redshift $z \sim 1$ is added. Two new references are
  added. This version of the paper will appear in Int. J. Mod. Phys. D

  Recent astrophysical observations seem to indicate that the cosmological
constant is small but nonzero and positive. The old cosmological constant
problem asks why it is so small; we must now ask, in addition, why it is
nonzero (and is in the range found by recent observations), and why it is
positive. In this essay, we try to kill these three metaphorical birds with one
stone. That stone is the unimodular theory of gravity, which is the ordinary
theory of gravity, except for the way the cosmological constant arises in the
theory. We argue that the cosmological constant becomes dynamical, and
eventually, in terms of the cosmic scale factor $R(t)$, it takes the form
$\Lambda(t) = \Lambda(t_0)(R(t_0)/R(t))^2$, but not before the epoch
corresponding to the redshift parameter $z \sim 1$.
