  We investigate the role of massless magnetic monopoles in the N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills Higgs theories. They can appear naturally in the
1/4-BPS dyonic configurations associated with multi-pronged string
configurations. Massless magnetic monopoles can carry nonabelian electric
charge when their associated gauge symmetry is unbroken. Surprisingly, massless
monopoles can also appear even when the gauge symmetry is broken to abelian
subgroups.
