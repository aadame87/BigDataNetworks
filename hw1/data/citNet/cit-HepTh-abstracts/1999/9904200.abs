  We point out that the concept of Abelian projection gives us a physical
interpretation of the role that the Hitchin fibration of parabolic K(D) pairs
plays in the large-N limit of four-dimensional QCD. This physical
interpretation furnishes also a simple criterium for the confinement of
electric fluxes in the large-N limit of QCD. There is also an alternative,
compatible interpretation, based on the QCD string.
