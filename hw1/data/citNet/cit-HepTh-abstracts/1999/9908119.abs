  The freedom one has in constructing locally gauge invariant charged fields in
gauge theories is analyzed in full detail and exploited to construct, in QED,
an electron field whose two-point function W(p), up to the fourth order in the
coupling constant, is normalized with on-shell normalization conditions and is,
nonetheless, infra-red finite; as a consequence the radiative corrections
vanish on the mass shell $p^2=\mu^2$ and the free field singularity is
dominant, although, in contrast to quantum field theories with mass gap, the
eigenvalue $\mu^2$ of the mass operator is not isolated. The same construction,
carried out for the quark in QCD, is not sufficient for cancellation of
infra-red divergences to take place in the fourth order. The latter
divergences, however, satisfy a simple factorization equation. We speculate on
the scenario that could be drawn about infra-red asymptotic dynamics of QCD,
should this factorization equation be true in any order of perturbation theory.
