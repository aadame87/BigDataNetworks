Title: On Symmetry Restoration at Finite Temperature (Scalar Case)

  We investigate the effective potential for a scalar $\Phi^{4}$ theory with
spontaneous symmetry breaking at finite temperature. All 'daisy' and 'super
daisy' diagrams are summed up and the properties of the corresponding gap
eqation are investigated. It is shown exactly that the phase transition is
first order.
