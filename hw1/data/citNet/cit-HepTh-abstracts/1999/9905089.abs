  We discuss the quantum corrections to thermodynamics (and geometry) of S(A)dS
BHs using large $N$ one-loop anomaly induced effective action for dilaton
coupled matter (scalars and spinors). It is found the temperature, mass and
entropy with account of quantum effects for multiply horizon SdS BH and SAdS BH
what also gives the corresponding expressions for their limits: Schwarzschild
and de Sitter spaces. In the last case one can talk about quantum correction to
entropy of expanding Universe.
  The anomaly induced action under discussion corresponds to 4d formulation
(s-wave approximation, 4d quantum matter is minimal one) as well as 2d
formulation (complete effective action, 2d quantum matter is dilaton coupled
one). Hence, most of results are given for the same gravitational background
with interpretation as 4d quantum corrected BH or 2d quantum corrected
dilatonic BH. Quantum aspects of thermodynamics of 4d 't Hooft BH model are
also considered.
