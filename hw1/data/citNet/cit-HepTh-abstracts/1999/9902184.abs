  We consider quantum \cal{N} = 4 super Yang-Mills theory interacting in a
covariant way with \cal{N} = 4 conformal supergravity. The induced large N
effective action for such a theory is calculated on a dilaton-gravitational
background using the conformal anomaly found via AdS/CFT correspondence.
Considering such an effective action as a quantum correction to the classical
gravity action we study quantum cosmology. In particular, the effect from
dilaton to the scale factor (which without dilaton corresponds to the
inflationary universe) is investigated. It is shown that, dependent on the
initial conditions for the dilaton, the dilaton may slow down, or accelerate,
the inflation process. At late times, the dilaton is decaying exponentially.
