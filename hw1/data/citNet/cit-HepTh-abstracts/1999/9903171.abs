  The infinite dimensional generalization of the quantum mechanics of extended
objects, namely, the quantum field theory of extended objects is presented. The
paradigm example studied in this paper is the Euclidean scalar field with a
$\lambda (\phi^{6})/6!$ interaction in four spacetime dimensions. The theory is
found to be finite when the virtual particle intermediate states are
characterized by fuzzy particles instead of ordinary pointlike particles.
Causality, Lorentz invariance, and unitarity (verified up to fourth order in
the coupling constant) are preserved in the theory. In addition, the
Kallen-Lehmann spectral representation for the propagator is discussed.
