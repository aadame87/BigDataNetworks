  The purpose of this short review is to present progresses in string theory in
the recent past. There have been very important developments in our
understanding of string dynamics, especially in the nonperturbative aspects. In
this context, dualities play a cardinal role. The string theory provides a
deeper understanding of the physics of special class of black holes from a
microscopical point of view and has resolved several important questions. It is
also recognized that M-theory provides a unified description of the five
perturbatively consistent string theories. The article covers some of these
aspects and highlights important progress made in string theory.
