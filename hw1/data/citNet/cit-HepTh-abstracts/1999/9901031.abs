  In thermal states of chiral theories, as recently investigated by H.-J.
Borchers and J. Yngvason, there exists a rich group of hidden symmetries. Here
we show that this leads to a radical converse of of the Hawking-Unruh
observation in the following sense. The algebraic commutant of the algebra
associated with a (heat bath) thermal chiral system can be used to reprocess
the thermal system into a ground state system on a larger algebra with a larger
localization space-time. This happens in such a way that the original system
appears as a kind of generalized Unruh restriction of the ground state sytem
and the thermal commutant as being transmutated into newly created ``virgin
space-time region'' behind a horizon. The related concepts of a ``chiral
conformal core'' and the possibility of a ``blow-up'' of the latter suggest
interesting ideas on localization of degrees of freedom with possible
repercussion on how to define quantum entropy of localized matter content in
Local Quantum Physics.
