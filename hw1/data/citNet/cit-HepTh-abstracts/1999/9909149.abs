  We consider string theory on AdS_3 in terms of the Wakimoto free field
representation. The scattering amplitudes for N unitary tachyons are analysed
in the factorization limit and the poles corresponding to the mass-shell
conditions for physical states are extracted. The vertex operators for excited
levels are obtained from the residues and their properties are examined.
Negative norm states are found at the second mass level.
