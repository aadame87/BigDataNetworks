  We construct dual Type I' string descriptions to five dimensional
supersymmetric fixed points with $E_{N_f+1}$ global symmetry. The background is
obtained as the near horizon geometry of the D4-D8 brane system in massive Type
IIA supergravity. We use the dual description to deduce some properties of the
fixed points.
