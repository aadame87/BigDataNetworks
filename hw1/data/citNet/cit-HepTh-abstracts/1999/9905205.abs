  Thermodynamics of d=4, N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is studied
with particular attention on perturbative expansion at weak `t Hooft coupling
regime and interpolation to strong coupling regime thereof. Non-ideal gas
effect to free-energy is calculated and found that leading- and
next-to-leading-order corrections contribute with relative opposite sign. Pade
approximant method is adopted to improve fixed-order, perturbative series and
is found to decrease free-energy monotonically as `t Hooft coupling parameter
is increased. This may be regarded as an indication of smooth interpolation of
thermodynamics between weak and strong `t Hooft coupling regimes, as suggested
by Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence.
