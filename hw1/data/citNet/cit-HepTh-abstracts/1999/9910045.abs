  The structure of spinning particle suggested by the rotating Kerr-Newman
(black hole) solution, super-Kerr-Newman solution and the Kerr-Sen solution to
low energy string theory is considered. Main peculiarities of the Kerr spinning
particle are discussed: a vortex of twisting principal null congruence,
singular ring and the Kerr source representing a rotating relativistic disk of
the Compton size. A few stringy structures can be found in the real and complex
Kerr geometry.
  Low-energy string theory predicts the existence of a heterotic string placed
on the sharp boundary of this disk. The obtained recently supergeneralization
of the Kerr-Newman solution suggests the existence of extra axial singular line
and fermionic traveling waves concentrating near these singularities.
  We discuss briefly a possibility of experimental test of these predictions.
