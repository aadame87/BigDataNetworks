  The complete proof of a theorem announced in [1] on the consistent
interactions for (non-chiral) exterior form gauge fields is given. The theorem
can be easily generalized to the analysis of anomalies. Its proof amounts to
computing the local BRST cohomology H^0(s|d) in the space of local n-forms
depending on the fields, the ghosts, the antifields and their derivatives.
