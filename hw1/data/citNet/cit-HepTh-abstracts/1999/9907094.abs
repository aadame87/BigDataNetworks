  We construct D0-branes in SO(32)$\times$SO(32) open type 0 string theory
using the same method as the one used to construct non-BPS D0-brane in type I
string theory. It has been proposed that this theory is S-dual to bosonic
string theory compactified on SO(32) lattice, which has SO(32)$\times$SO(32)
spinor states as excited states of fundamental string. One of these states
seems to correspond to the D0-brane, and by the requirement that other states
which do not have corresponding states must be removed, we can determine the
way of truncation of the spectrum. This result supports the conjecture.
