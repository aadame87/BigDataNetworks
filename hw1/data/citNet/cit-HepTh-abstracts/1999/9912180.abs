  We construct the integrable model corresponding to the $\N=2$ supersymmetric
SU(N) gauge theory with matter in the antisymmetric representation, using the
spectral curve found by Landsteiner and Lopez through M Theory. The model turns
out to be the Hamiltonian reduction of a $N+2$ periodic spin chain model, which
is Hamiltonian with respect to the universal symplectic form we had constructed
earlier for general soliton equations in the Lax or Zakharov-Shabat
representation.
