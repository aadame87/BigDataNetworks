  Generalising a result of classical mechanics an infinite set of conserved
quantities can be found for the bare equations of motion describing the
evolution of a scalar field in out of equilibrium quantum field theory, in the
large N approximation, with initial conditions corresponding to a thermal
system of the free Hamiltonian. Using these new conserved quantities, sum-rules
relating integrals over the mode-functions (momenta) can be derived. More, the
corresponding renormalised quantities can also be computed out thus giving
information about the evolution of the already known renormalised equations;
finally it is also possible to write a renormalised version of the sum-rules.
