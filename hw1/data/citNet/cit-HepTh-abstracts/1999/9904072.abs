Title: Relativistic Gamow Vectors

  Gamow vectors in non-relativistic quantum mechanics are generalized
eigenvectors (kets) of self-adjoint Hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues. Like
the Dirac kets, they are mathematically well defined in the Rigged Hilbert
Space. Gamow kets are derived from the resonance poles of the S-matrix. They
have a Breit-Wigner energy distribution, an exponential decay law, and are
members of a basis vector expansion whose truncation gives the finite
dimensional effective theories with a complex Hamiltonian matrix. They also
have an asymmetric time evolution described by a semigroup generated by the
Hamiltonian, which expresses a fundamental quantum mechanical arrow of time.
These Gamow kets are generalized to relativistic Gamow vectors by extrapolating
from the Galilei group to the Poincare group. This leads to semigroup
representations of the Poincare group which are characterized by spin j and
complex invariant mass square. In these non-unitary representations the Lorentz
subgroup is unitarily represented and the four-momenta are "minimally complex"
in the sense that the four-velocity is real. The relativistic Gamow vectors
have all the properties listed above for the non-relativistic Gamow vectors and
are therefore ideally suited to describe relativistic resonances and
quasistable particles.
