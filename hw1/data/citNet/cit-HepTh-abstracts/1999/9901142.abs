  We study the strong coupling limit of the 2-flavor massless Schwinger model
on a lattice using staggered fermions and the Hamiltonian approach to lattice
gauge theories. Using the correspondence between the low-lying states of the
2-flavor strongly coupled lattice Schwinger model and the antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg chain established in a previous paper, we explicitly compute the
mass gaps of the other excitations in terms of vacuum expectation values
(v.e.v.'s) of powers of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and spin-spin correlation
functions. We find a satisfactory agreement with the results of the continuum
theory already at the second order in the strong coupling expansion. We show
that the pattern of symmetry breaking of the continuum theory is well
reproduced by the lattice theory; we see indeed that in the lattice theory the
isoscalar and isovector chiral condensates are zero to every order in the
strong coupling expansion. In addition, we find that the chiral condensate
$<\bar{\psi}_{L}^{(2)}\bar{\psi}_{L}^{(1)}\psi_{R}^{(1)}\psi_{R}^{(2)}>$ is non
zero also on the lattice; this is the only relic in this lattice model of the
axial anomaly in the continuum theory. We compute the v.e.v.'s of the spin-spin
correlators of the Heisenberg model which are pertinent to the calculation of
the mass spectrum and obtain an explicit construction of the lowest lying
states for finite size Heisenberg Hamiltonian chains.
