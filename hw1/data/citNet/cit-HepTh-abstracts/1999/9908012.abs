  For linear bose field theories, I show that if a classical Hamiltonian
function is strictly positive, then there is a canonical transformation making
the evolution orthogonal. This structure theorem is used to analyze the
corresponding quantum theories. It is shown that there is an intimate
connection between boundedness-below and self-adjoint implementability.
  Finally, it is shown that there is a broad class of "quantum inequalities:"
any timelike component of the four-momentum density operator, averaged over a
compact region in curved space-time, must be bounded below.
