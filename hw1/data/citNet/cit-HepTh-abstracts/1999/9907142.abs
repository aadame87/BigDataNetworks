  Type IIB string theory expanded around D3 brane backgrounds describes the
dynamics of D3 branes as solitonic objects. On the other hand, there is a
fundamental description of them via Polchinski's open strings with Dirichlet
boundary conditions. Since these two descriptions describe the dynamics of the
same objects, D3 branes, it is natural to believe that they are dual. Therefore
at this level, we have a string-string duality as opposed to a string-field
theory duality. Once we take the same limits in both descriptions, Maldacena
Conjecture in its weaker form follows. We try to make this viewpoint precise
and study the implication of it for the stronger form of Maldacena Conjecture.
