  We find novel bound states of NS5, D6 and D8-branes in massive Type IIA
string theory. As the NS gauge transformations can change the Chern class of
the RR field these configurations should be thought of as nonlocal objects
called gerbes. We develop a global formalism for theories that involve massive
tensor fields in general, and apply it in massive Type IIA supergravity. We
check the results by investigating the T-dual NS5/D5-brane configurations in
Type IIB, and relate them to an F-theory compactification on a CY3. We comment
on the implications to consistency conditions for brane-wrapping and the
classification of D-brane charges in terms of K-theory classes.
