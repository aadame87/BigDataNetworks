  We propose a connection between conformal field theory (CFT) and the exact
solution and integrability of the reduced BCS model of superconductivity. The
relevant CFT is given by the $SU(2)_k$-WZW model in the singular limit when the
level k goes to -2. This theory has to be perturbed by an operator proportional
to the inverse of the BCS coupling constant. Using the free field realization
of this perturbed Wess-Zumino-Witten model, we derive the exact Richardson's
wave function and the integrals of motion of the reduced BCS model in the
saddle point approximation. The construction is reminiscent of the CFT approach
to the Fractional Quantum Hall effect.
