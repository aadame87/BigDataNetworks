  incompatibility of the AdS/CFT and the lattice regulators, and on the
  appropriate boundary conditions

  We consider contributions to the heavy quark potential, in the AdS/CFT
approach to SU(N) gauge theory, which arise from first order fluctuations of
the associated worldsheet in anti-deSitter space. The gaussian fluctuations
occur around a classical worldsheet configuration resembling an infinite square
well, with the bottom of the well lying at the AdS horizon. The eigenvalues of
the corresponding Laplacian operators can be shown numerically to be very close
to those in flat space. We find that two of the transverse world sheet fields
become massive, which may have implications for the existence of a L{\"u}scher
term in the heavy quark potential. It is also suggested that these massive
degrees of freedom may relate to extrinsic curvature in an effective D=4 string
theory.
