  We calculate the conformal anomaly from 5d Weyl gravity (with broken
conformal symmetry) which is conjectured to be supergravity dual to ${\cal
N}=2$ superconformal field theory via AdS/CFT correspondence. Its comparison
with ${\cal N}=2$ SCFT conformal anomaly (UV calculation) suggests that such
duality may exist subject to presence of sub-leading 1/N corrections to
cosmological and gravitational constants.
