  We analyse the dipole solution of heterotic string theory in four dimensions.
It has the structure of monopole and anti-monopole connected by flux line
(string). Due to growing coupling near the poles, the length of the string
diverges. However, exploiting the self-duality of heterotic string theory in
four dimension, we argue that this string is correctly described in terms of
dual variables.
