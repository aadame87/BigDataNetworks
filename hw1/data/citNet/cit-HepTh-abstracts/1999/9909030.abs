  The structures in target space geometry that correspond to conformally
invariant boundary conditions in WZW theories are determined both by studying
the scattering of closed string states and by investigating the algebra of open
string vertex operators. In the limit of large level, we find branes whose
world volume is a regular conjugacy class or, in the case of symmetry breaking
boundary conditions, a `twined' version thereof. In particular, in this limit
one recovers the commutative algebra of functions over the brane world volume,
and open strings connecting different branes disappear. At finite level, the
branes get smeared out, yet their approximate localization at (twined)
conjugacy classes can be detected unambiguously.
  As a by-product, it is demonstrated how the pentagon identity and tetrahedral
symmetry imply that in any rational conformal field theory the structure
constants of the algebra of boundary operators coincide with specific entries
of fusing matrices.
