  Compactifications of type IIB string theory on AdS5 x X5, where X5 is an
Einstein space, can have one-fourth or half maximal supersymmetry for certain
choices of X5. Some of these theories admit exotic domain walls arising from
5-branes wrapping 2-cycles in X5. We explore the relationship among these
domain walls, fractional branes and branes stretched on intervals. World-volume
fluxes in the wrapped branes play an important role in the analysis. We draw
some parallels between the AdS background with exotic domain walls and N=1
supersymmetric MQCD, and identify other extended objects on the AdS side in the
dual brane construction. The process of brane creation is used to give an
alternate derivation of the relationship between fractional branes and branes
on intervals.
