  It is conjectured that the two closed bosonic string theories, Type 0A and
Type 0B, correspond to certain supersymmetry breaking orbifold
compactifications of M-theory. Various implications of this conjecture are
discussed, in particular the behaviour of the tachyon at strong coupling and
the existence of non-perturbative fermionic states in Type 0A. The latter are
shown to correspond to bound states of Type 0A D-particles, thus providing
further evidence for the conjecture. We also give a comprehensive description
of the various Type 0 closed and open string theories.
