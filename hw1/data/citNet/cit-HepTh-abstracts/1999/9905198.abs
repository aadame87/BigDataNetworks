  We conjecture that a T-dual form of pure QCD describes dynamics of point-like
monopoles. T-duality transforms the QCD Lagrangian into a matrix quantum
mechanics of zerobranes which we identify with monopoles. At generic points of
the monopole moduli space the SU(N) gauge group is broken down to $U(1)^{N-1}$
reproducing the key feature of 't Hooft's Abelian projection. There are certain
points in the moduli space where monopole positions coincide, gauge symmetry is
enhanced and gluons emerge as massless excitations. We show that there is a
linearly rising potential between zerobranes. This indicates the presence of a
stretched flux tube between monopoles. The lowest energy state is achieved when
monopoles are sitting on top of each other and gauge symmetry is enhanced. In
this case they behave as free massive particles and can condense. In fact, we
find a constant eigenfunction of the corresponding Hamiltonian which describes
condensation of monopoles. Using the monopole quantum mechanics, we argue that
large $N$ QCD in this T-dual picture is a theory of a closed bosonic membrane
propagating in {\em five} dimensional space-time. QCD point-like monopoles can
be regarded in this approach as constituents of the membrane.
