  Conformally compactified phase space is conceived as an automorphism space
for the global action of the extended conformal group. Space time and momentum
space appear then as conformally dual, that is conjugate with respect to
conformal reflections. If now the former, as generally agreed, is appropriate
for the description of classical mechanics in euclidean geometrical form, then
the latter results appropriate for the description of quantum mechanics in
spinor geometrical form. In such description, fermion multiplets will naturally
appear as consequence of higher symmetries and furthermore, the euclidean
geometry, bilinearly resulting from that of spinors, will a priori guarantee
the absence of ultraviolet divergences when dealing with quantum field
theories. Some further possible consequences of conformal reflections of
interest for physics, are briefly outlined.
