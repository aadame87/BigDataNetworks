  I review some aspects of BPS magnetic monopoles and of electric-magnetic
duality in theories with arbitrary gauge groups. When the symmetry is maximally
broken to a U(1)^r subgroup, all magnetically charged configurations can be
understood in terms of r species of massive fundamental monopoles. When the
unbroken group has a non-Abelian factor, some of these fundamental monopoles
become massless and can be viewed as the duals to the massless gauge bosons.
Rather than appearing as distinct solitons, these massless monopoles are
manifested as clouds of non-Abelian field surrounding one or more massive
monopoles. I describe in detail some examples of solutions with such clouds.
