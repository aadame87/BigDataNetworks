Title: An Application of the Schwarzian Derivative
Authors: Bihn Zhou and Chuan-Jie Zhu
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX, no figures
\\
  In this note we present an application of the Schwarzian derivative. By
exploiting some properties of the Schwarzian derivative, we solve the equation
appearing in the gravity-dilaton-antisymmetric tensor system. We also mention
that this method can also be used to solve some other equations.
