  We compute the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum of the D=11 supergravity
compactified on AdS2 x S2 x T7 and arrange it into representations of the
SU(1,1|2) superconformal algebra. This geometry arises in M theory as the near
horizon limit of a D=4 extremal black-hole constructed by wrapping four groups
of M-branes along the T7. Via AdS/CFT correspondence, our result gives a
prediction for the spectrum of the chiral primary operators in the dual
conformal quantum mechanics yet to be formulated.
