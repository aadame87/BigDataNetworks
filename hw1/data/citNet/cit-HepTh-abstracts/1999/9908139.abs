  We propose a new mechanism for the formation of conical singularities on
D-branes by means of recoil resulting from scattering of closed string states
propagating in the (large) transverse dimensions. By viewing the (spatial part
of the) four-dimensional world as a 3-brane with large transverse dimensions
the above mechanism can lead to supersymmetry obstruction at the TeV scale. The
vacuum remains supersymmetric while the mass spectrum picks up a supersymmetry
obstructing mass splitting. The state with ``broken'' supersymmetry is not an
equilibrium ground state, but is rather an excited state of the D-brane which
relaxes to the supersymmetric ground state asymptotically in (cosmic) time.
