  We apply the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz to investigate the high energy
behaviour of a class of scattering matrices which have recently been proposed
to describe the Homogeneous sine-Gordon models related to simply laced Lie
algebras. A characteristic feature is that some elements of the suggested
S-matrices are not parity invariant and contain resonance shifts which allow
for the formation of unstable bound states. From the Lagrangian point of view
these models may be viewed as integrable perturbations of WZNW-coset models and
in our analysis we recover indeed in the deep ultraviolet regime the effective
central charge related to these cosets, supporting therefore the S-matrix
proposal. For the $SU(3)_k$-model we present a detailed numerical analysis of
the scaling function which exhibits the well known staircase pattern for
theories involving resonance parameters, indicating the energy scales of stable
and unstable particles. We demonstrate that, as a consequence of the interplay
between the mass scale and the resonance parameter, the ultraviolet limit of
the HSG-model may be viewed alternatively as a massless
ultraviolet-infrared-flow between different conformal cosets. For $k=2$ we
recover as a subsystem the flow between the tricritical Ising and the Ising
model.
