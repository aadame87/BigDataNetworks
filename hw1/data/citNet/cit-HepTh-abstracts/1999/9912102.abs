Title: Generalized Casimir Energies for systems with arbitrary ($\epsilon(z)$)
  planar geometry
Authors: O. Kenneth
Comments: 9 pages, latex
\\
  The Casimir force between parallel plates of arbitrary kind is shown to be
simply related to the plates transmission and reflection coefficient. A trivial
application of this general relation leads to the known Lifshitz force between
dielectrics as well as its generalizations.
