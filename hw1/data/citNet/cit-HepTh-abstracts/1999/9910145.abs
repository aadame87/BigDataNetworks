  We present a perturbative study of Ramond-Ramond backgrounds in the NSR
formalism. We show how to perform sigma-model computations and discuss in
detail the structure of the BRST charge and picture-changing operators. Contact
terms play a vital role in the analysis. We also give evidence for a two loop
non-renormalization theorem for the background beta functions.
