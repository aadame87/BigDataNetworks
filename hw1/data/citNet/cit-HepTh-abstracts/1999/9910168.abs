  We discuss the possibility to construct an effective quantum field theory for
an axial vector coupled to a Dirac spinor field. A massive axial vector
describes antisymmetric torsion. The consistency conditions include unitarity
and renormalizability in the low-energy region. The investigation of the Ward
identities and the one- and two-loop divergences indicate serious problems
arising in the theory. The final conclusion is that torsion may exist as a
string excitation, but there are very severe restrictions for the existence of
a propagating torsion field, subject to the quantization procedure, at low
energies.
