  The moduli space of charge k SU(2) BPS monopoles is diffeomorphic to the
moduli space of degree k rational maps between Riemann spheres. In this note we
describe a numerical algorithm to compute the monopole fields and energy
density from the rational map. The results for some symmetric examples are
presented.
