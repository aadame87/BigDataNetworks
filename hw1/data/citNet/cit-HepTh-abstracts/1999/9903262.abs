  Various definitions of chiral observables in a given Moebius covariant
two-dimensional theory are shown to be equivalent. Their representation theory
in the vacuum Hilbert space of the 2D theory is studied. It shares the general
characteristics of modular invariant partition functions, although SL(2,Z)
transformation properties are not assumed. First steps towards classification
are made.
