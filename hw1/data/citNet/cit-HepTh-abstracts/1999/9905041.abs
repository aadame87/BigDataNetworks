  hadron and lepton degrees of freedom in it

  New string dynamics is formulated on the basis of the extended set of
supergauge constraints including not only supergauge Virasoro conditions but
also nilpotent supercurrent constraints . This approach arises from a natural
generalization of the classical operator many-string vertices. The formulation
of this model leads to three two-dimensional surfaces for description of hadron
strings. It gives some dynamical generalization of Chan-Paton factor for string
amplitudes in terms of operator vertices. Supersymmetry on the 2-d world
surface is present but ten-dimensional supersymmetry is absent.
  In this approach two-dimensional fermion string fields make it possible to
give a unified description of hadron and lepton degrees of freedom and of its
dynamics. This model allows to solve the problem of elimination of the most
part of parity twins in the baryon spectrum.
  One-loop (and many-loops perhaps) amplitudes in this model are finite due to
the extended set of supergauge constraints and to the significant excess of the
total number of fermion two-dimensional fields over the number of boson 2-d
fields.
