  We report on tests of the AdS/CFT correspondence that are made possible by
complete knowledge of the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum of type IIB supergravity
on $AdS_5 \times T^{11}$ with T^{11}=SU(2)^2/U(1). After briefly discussing
general multiplet shortening conditions in SU(2,2|1) and PSU(2,2|4), we compare
various types of short SU(2,2|1) supermultiplets on AdS_5 and different
families of boundary operators with protected dimensions. The supergravity
analysis predicts the occurrence in the SCFT at leading order in N and g_s N,
of extra towers of long multiplets whose dimensions are rational but not
protected by supersymmetry.
