  Based on results for real deformation parameter q we introduce a compact non-
commutative structure covariant under the quantum group SOq(3) for q being a
root of unity. To match the algebra of the q-deformed operators with necesarry
conjugation properties it is helpful to define a module over the algebra
genera- ted by the powers of q. In a representation where X is diagonal we show
how P can be calculated. To manifest some typical properties an example of a
one-di- mensional q-deformed Heisenberg algebra is also considered and compared
with non-compact case.
