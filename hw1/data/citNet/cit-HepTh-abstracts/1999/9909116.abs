  We present a Z_2 x Z_2 four dimensional orientifold in which supersymmetry is
broken by a temperature-like Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. As usual in this type of
models, at the tree-level the breaking affects only the branes tangent to the
direction involved by the SS deformation, and it can propagate only through
radiative corrections to other sectors, where the gauge group is broken. The
result is a non-chiral model with gauge group Usp(16)^2 x Usp(8)^4.
