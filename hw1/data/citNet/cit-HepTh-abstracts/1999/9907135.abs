Title: Self-interaction effects on screening in three-dimensional QED
Author: Subir Ghosh
Journal-ref: J.Phys. A33 (2000) 1915-1919
\\
  We have shown that self interaction effects in massive quantum
electrodynamics can lead to the formation of bound states of quark antiquark
pairs. A current-current fermion coupling term is introduced, which induces a
well in the potential energy profile. Explicit expressions of the effective
potential and renormalized parameters are provided.
