  Nonlinear gauge theory is a gauge theory based on a nonlinear Lie algebra
(finite W algebra) or a Poisson algebra, which yields a canonical star product
for deformation quantization as a correlator on a disk. We pursue nontrivial
deformation of topological gauge theory with conjugate scalars in two
dimensions. This leads to two-dimensional nonlinear gauge theory exclusively,
which implies its essential uniqueness. We also consider a possible extension
to higher dimensions.
