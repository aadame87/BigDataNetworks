  A general method for solving the so-called quantum inverse scattering problem
(namely the reconstruction of local quantum (field) operators in term of the
quantum monodromy matrix satisfying a Yang-Baxter quadratic algebra governed by
an R-matrix) for a large class of lattice quantum integrable models is given.
The principal requirement being the initial condition (R(0) = P, the
permutation operator) for the quantum R-matrix solving the Yang-Baxter
equation, it applies not only to most known integrable fundamental lattice
models (such as Heisenberg spin chains) but also to lattice models with
arbitrary number of impurities and to the so-called fused lattice models
(including integrable higher spin generalizations of Heisenberg chains). Our
method is then applied to several important examples like the sl(n) XXZ model,
the XYZ spin-1/2 chain and also to the spin-s Heisenberg chains.
