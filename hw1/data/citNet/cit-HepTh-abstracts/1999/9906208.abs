Title: The deconfinement phase transition as an Aharonov-Bohm effect
Authors: Janos Polonyi
Comments: 7 pages, talk delivered at the workshop "Understanding Deconfinement
  in QCD", Trento, Italy, March, 1999
\\
  A subjective and incomplete list of interesting and unique features of the
deconfinement phase transition is presented. Furthermore a formal similarity of
the density matrix of the Aharonov-Bohm system and QCD is mentioned, as well.
