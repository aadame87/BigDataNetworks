  We present unique solutions of the Seiberg-Witten Monopole Equations in which
the U(1) curvature is covariantly constant, the monopole Weyl spinor consists
of a single constant component, and the 4-manifold is a product of two Riemann
surfaces of genuses p_1 and p_2. There are p_1 -1 magnetic vortices on one
surface and p_2 - 1 electric ones on the other, with p_1 + p_2 \geq 2 p_1 =
p_2= 1 being excluded). When p_1 = p_2, the electromagnetic fields are
self-dual and one also has a solution of the coupled euclidean
Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac equations, with the monopole condensate serving as
cosmological constant. The metric is decomposable and the electromagnetic
fields are covariantly constant as in the Bertotti-Robinson solution. The
Einstein metric can also be derived from a K\"{a}hler potential satisfying the
Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations.
