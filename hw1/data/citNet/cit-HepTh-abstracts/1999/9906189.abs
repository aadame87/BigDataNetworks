  We describe the generalization of spherical field theory to other modal
expansion methods. The main approach remains the same, to reduce a
d-dimensional field theory into a set of coupled one-dimensional systems. The
method we discuss here uses an expansion with respect to periodic-box modes. We
apply the method to phi^4 theory in two dimensions and compute the critical
coupling and critical exponents. We compare with lattice results and
predictions via universality and the two-dimensional Ising model.
