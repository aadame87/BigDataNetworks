  We study the question of the Ward identity for "large" gauge invariance in
0+1 dimensional theories. We derive the relevant Ward identities for a single
flavor fermion and a single flavor complex scalar field interacting with an
Abelian gauge field. These identities are nonlinear. The Ward identity for any
other complicated theory can be derived from these basic sets of identities.
However, the structure of the Ward identity changes since these are nonlinear
identities. In particular, we work out the "large" gauge Ward identity for a
supersymmetric theory involving a single flavor of fermion as well as a complex
scalar field. Contrary to the effective action for the individual theories, the
solution of the Ward identity in the supersymmetric theory involves an infinity
of Fourier component modes. We comment on which features of this analysis are
likely/unlikely to generalize to the 2+1 dimensional theory.
