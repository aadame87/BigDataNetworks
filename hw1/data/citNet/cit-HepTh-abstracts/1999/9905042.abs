  It has been recently proposed to embed the standard model in a conformal
gauge theory to resolve the hierarchy problem, and to avoid assuming either
grand unification or low-energy supersymmetry. By model building based on
string-field duality we show how to maintain the successful prediction of an
electroweak mixing angle with $sin^2\theta \simeq 0.231$ in conformal gauge
theories with three chiral families.
