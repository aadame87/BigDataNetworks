  The bi-local model of hadrons is studied from the viewpoint of
non-commutative geometry formulated so that Higgs-like scalar fields play the
role of a bridge, the bi-local fields, connecting different spacetime points.
We show that the resultant action for Higgs-like scalar fields has a structure
similar to that of the linear sigma model. According to this formalism, we can
deduce the dual nature of meson fields as the Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated
with chiral symmetry breaking and bound states of quarks.
