  We re-examine the graceful exit problem in the pre-big bang scenario of
string cosmology, by considering the most general time-dependent classical
correction to the Lagrangian with up to four derivatives. By including possible
forms for quantum loop corrections we examine the allowed region of parameter
space for the coupling constants which enable our solutions to link smoothly
the two asymptotic low-energy branches of the pre-big bang scenario, and
observe that these solutions can satisfy recently proposed entropic bounds on
viable singularity free cosmologies.
