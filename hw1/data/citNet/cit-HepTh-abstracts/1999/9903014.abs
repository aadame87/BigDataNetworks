  We study discrete fluxes in four dimensional SU(N) gauge theories with a mass
gap by using brane compactifications which give ${\cal{N}} = 1$ or ${\cal{N}} =
0$ supersymmetry. We show that when such theories are compactified further on a
torus, the t'Hooft magnetic flux $m$ is related to the NS two-form modulus $B$
by $B = 2\pi {m\over N}$. These values of $B$ label degenerate brane vacua,
giving a simple demonstration of magnetic screening. Furthermore, for these
values of $B$ one has a conventional gauge theory on a commutative torus,
without having to perform any T-dualities. Because of the mass gap, a generic
$B$ does not give a four dimensional gauge theory on a non-commutative torus.
The Kaluza-Klein modes which must be integrated out to give a four dimensional
theory decouple only when $B=2\pi {m\over N}$. Finally we show that $2\pi
{m\over N}$ behaves like a two form modulus of the QCD string. This confirms a
previous conjecture based on properties of large $N$ QCD suggesting a T-duality
invariance.
