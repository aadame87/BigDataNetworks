  The electrogravity transformation is applied to the three-dimensional
Einstein field equations to obtain new multi-parameter families of black hole
solutions. The Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole is shown to be a
special case of one of these families. The causal structure, associated matter,
as well as the mechanical and thermodynamical properties of some of the
solutions are discussed.
