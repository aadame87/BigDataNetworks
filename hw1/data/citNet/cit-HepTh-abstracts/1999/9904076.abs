  By solving the Ward identities in a superconformal field theory we find the
unique three-point Green's functions composed of chiral superfields for N =
1,2,3,4 supersymmetry. We show that the N=1 four-point function with R-charge
equal to one is uniquely determined by the Ward identities up to the
specification of four constants. We discuss why chiral Green's functions above
three-points, with total R-charge greater than N, are not uniquely determined.
