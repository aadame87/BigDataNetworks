  The vacuum energy of a scalar field in a spherically symmetric background
field is considered. Based on previous work [hep-th/9608070], the numerical
procedure is refined further and applied to several examples. We provide
numerical evidence that repulsive potentials lead to positive contributions to
the vacuum energy. Furthermore, the crucial role played by bound-states is
clearly seen.
