Title: Spinning Particle as a Non-trivial Rotating Super Black Hole with Broken
  N=2 Supersymmetry
Author: A. Burinskii
Comments: 28 pages, LaTeX, invited talk at the Second International Symposium
  on Frontiers of Fundamental Physics (Hyderabad, December 30, 1998 - January
  1, 1999). In this version the Introduction and Conclusion are extended, and
  one new section is added containing the self-consistent super-Kerr-Newman
  solutions to broken N=2 supergravity
Journal-ref: Class.Quant.Grav. 16 (1999) 3457-3516
\\
  Non-trivial supergeneralization of the Kerr-Newman solution is considered as
representing a combined model of the Kerr-Newman spinning particle and
superparticle.
  We show that the old problem of obtaining non-trivial super black hole
solutions can be resolved in supergravity broken by Goldstone fermion.
Non-linear realization of broken N=2 supersymmetry specific for the Kerr
geometry is considered and some examples of the super-Kerr geometries generated
by Goldstone fermion are analyzed. The resulting geometries acquire torsion,
Rarita-Schwinger field and extra wave contributions to metric and
electromagnetic field caused by Grassmann variables.
  One family of the self-consistent super-Kerr-Newman solutions to broken N=2
supergravity is selected, and peculiarities of these solutions are discussed.
In particular, the appearance of extra `axial' singular line and traveling
waves concentrated near `axial' and ring-like singularities.
