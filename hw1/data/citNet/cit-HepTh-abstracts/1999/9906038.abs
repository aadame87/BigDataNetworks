  We present a model for high energy two body scattering in a quantum theory of
gravity. The model is applicable for center of mass energies higher than the
relevant Planck scale. At impact parameters smaller than the Schwarzchild
radius appropriate to the center of mass energy and total charge of the initial
state, the cross section is dominated by an inelastic process in which a single
large black hole is formed. The black hole then decays by Hawking radiation.
The elastic cross section is highly suppressed at these impact parameters
because of the small phase space for thermal decay into a high energy two body
state. For very large impact parameter the amplitude is dominated by
eikonalized single graviton exchange. At intermediate impact parameters the
scattering is more complicated, but since the Schwarzchild radius grows with
energy, we speculate that a more sophisticated eikonal calculation which uses
the nonlinear classical solutions of the field equations may provide a good
approximation at all larger impact parameters. We discuss the extent to which
black hole production will be observable in theories with low scale quantum
gravity and large dimensions.
