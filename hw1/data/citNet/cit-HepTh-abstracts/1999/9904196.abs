  We use N=2 harmonic and projective superspaces to formulate the most general
`Ansatz' for the SU(2)_R invariant hypermultiplet low-energy effective action
(LEEA) in four dimensions, which describes the two-parametric family of the
hyper-K"ahler metrics generalizing the Atiyah-Hitchin metric. We then
demonstrate in the very explicit and manifestly N=2 supersymmetric way that the
(magnetically charged, massive) single hypermultiplet LEEA in the underlying
non-abelian N=2 supersymmetric quantum field theory can receive both
perturbative (e.g., in the Coulomb branch) and non-perturbative (e.g., in the
Higgs branch) quantum corrections. The manifestly N=2 supersymmetric Feynman
rules in harmonic superspace can be used to calculate the perturbative
corrections described by the Taub-NUT metric. The non-perturbative corrections
(due to instantons and anti-instantons) can be encoded in terms of an elliptic
curve, which is very reminiscent to the Seiberg-Witten theory. Our
four-dimensional results agree with the three-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory
and instanton calculations.
