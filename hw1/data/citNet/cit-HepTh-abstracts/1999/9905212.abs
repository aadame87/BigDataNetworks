  We here present, in modern notation, the classification of the discrete
finite subgroups of SU(4) as well as the character tables for the exceptional
cases thereof (Cf. http://pierre.mit.edu/~yhe/su4.ct). We hope this catalogue
will be useful to works on string orbifold theories, quiver theories, WZW
modular invariants, Gorenstein resolutions, nonlinear sigma-models as well as
some recently proposed inter-connections among them.
