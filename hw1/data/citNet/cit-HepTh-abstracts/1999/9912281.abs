  Open and closed strings with two worldsheet supersymmetries in 2+2
dimensional spacetime are reviewed in the NSR formulation. I briefly discuss
their quantization, mutual and self-interactions, classical spacetime dynamics
and interpretation in terms of self-dual Yang-Mills and gravity. A stringy
origin of the infinite self-dual gravity hierarchy is presented. An outlook to
the loop level concludes.
