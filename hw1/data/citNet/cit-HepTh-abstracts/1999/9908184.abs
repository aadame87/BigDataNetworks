  We note that S-matrix/conserved charge identities in affine Toda field
theories of the type recently noted by Khastgir can be put on a more systematic
footing. This makes use of a result first found by Ravanini, Tateo and
Valleriani for theories based on the simply-laced Lie algebras (A,D and E)
which we extend to the nonsimply-laced case. We also present the generalisation
to nonsimply-laced cases of the observation - for simply-laced situations -
that the conserved charges form components of the eigenvectors of the Cartan
matrix.
