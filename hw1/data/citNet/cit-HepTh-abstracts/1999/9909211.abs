  Applying the time-dependent variational principle of Balian and V\'en\'eroni,
we derive variational approximations for multi-time correlation functions in
$\Phi^4$ field theory. We assume first that the initial state is given and
characterized by a density operator equal to a Gaussian density matrix. Then,
we study the more realistic situation where only a few expectation values are
given at the initial time and we perform an optimization with respect to the
initial state. We calculate explicitly the two-time correlation functions with
two and four field operators at equilibrium in the symmetric phase.
