  We clarify a number of issues regarding the worldsheet and spacetime
descriptions of string propagation on AdS_3. We construct the vertex operators
of spacetime current algebra and spacetime (super) Virasoro generators in the
full interacting SL(2) WZW theory and study their Ward identities. We also
explain the relation between the analysis in this note and some recent work on
this subject.
