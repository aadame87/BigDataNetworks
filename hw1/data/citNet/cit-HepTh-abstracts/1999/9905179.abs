  A rigorous (and simple) proof is given that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between causal anti-deSitter covariant quantum field theories on
anti-deSitter space and causal conformally covariant quantum field theories on
its conformal boundary. The correspondence is given by the explicit
identification of observables localized in wedge regions in anti-deSitter space
and observables localized in double-cone regions in its boundary. It takes
vacuum states into vacuum states, and positive-energy representations into
positive-energy representations.
