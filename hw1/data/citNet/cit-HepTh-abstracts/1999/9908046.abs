  In this paper expressions are given for the bulk and boundary structure
constants of D-series Virasoro minimal models on the upper half plane. It is
the continuation of an earlier work on the A-series. The solution for the
boundary theory is found first and then extended to the bulk. The modular
invariant bulk field content is recovered as the maximal set of bulk fields
consistent with the boundary theory. It is found that the structure constants
are unique up to redefinition of the fields and in the chosen normalisation
exhibit a manifest Z_2-symmetry associated to the D-diagram. The solution has
been subjected to random numerical tests against the constraints it has to
fulfill.
