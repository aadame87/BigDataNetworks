  We study the vacuum partition functional Z [J] for a system of closed,
bosonic p-branes coupled to p-forms in the limiting case: p+1 = space-time
dimension. We suggest an extension of the duality transformation which can be
applied to the limiting case even though no dual gauge potential exists in the
conventional sense. The dual action thus obtained describes a current-current,
static interaction within the bulk volume bounded by the d-1-brane. Guided by
these results, we then construct a general expression for the parent Lagrangian
that allows for a unified treatment of p-duality, even in the presence of
external currents, using a first order formalism instead of the Bianchi
identities. Finally, we show how this generalized dualization approach can
accommodate the inclusion of a massive topological term in the parent action of
an Abelian gauge theory.
