  In this thesis we will discuss various aspects of noncommutative geometry and
compactified Little-String theories. First we will give an introduction to the
use of noncommutative geometry in string theory. Thereafter we will present a
proof of the connection between D-brane dynamics and noncommutative geometry.
Then we will explain the concept of instantons in noncommutative gauge
theories. The last chapters shift the focus to Little-String- and
$(2,0)$-theories. We study compactifications of these theories on tori with
twists. First we study the case of two coinciding branes in detail. Afterwards
we study the case of an arbitrary number of coinciding branes. The main result
here is that the moduli spaces of vacua for the twisted compactifications are
equal to moduli spaces of instantons on a noncommutative torus. A special case
of this is that a large class of gauge theories with $\SUSY{2}$ supersymmetry
in D=4 or $\SUSY{4}$ in D=3 has moduli spaces which are moduli spaces of
instantons on noncommutative tori.
