  Recently it was pointed out that in the TeV-scale brane world there is a
logical possibility where the electroweak Higgs can be identified with a fourth
generation slepton. In this paper we address various issues in this
four-generation TeV-scale Supersymmetric Standard Model with Higgs as a
slepton. In particular we discuss how to achieve proton stability by
suppressing the corresponding baryon number violating operators via gauging (a
discrete subgroup of) the baryon number U(1) symmetry. Dimension five lepton
number violating operators which would result in unacceptably large neutrino
masses can be similarly suppressed via gauging a discrete subgroup of the
lepton number U(1) symmetry. In fact, the four generation feature allows for a
novel higher dimensional mechanism for generating small Majorana neutrino
masses. We also discuss how to achieve gauge coupling unification, which can be
as precise at one loop as in the MSSM, and point out a possible geometric
embedding of the corresponding matter content in the brane world context.
Finally, we discuss adequate suppression of flavor changing neutral currents in
this model, and also point out a novel possibility for supersymmetry breaking
via a non-zero F-term of the fourth generation lepton superfield.
