  We describe a general method for calculating the infra-red limit of physical
quantities in unitary quantum field theories. Using analyticity of Green
functions in a complex scale parameter, the infra-red limit is expressed as a
contour integral entirely in the ultra-violet region. The infra-red limit is
shown to be the limit of the Borel transform of the physical quantity. The
method is illustrated by calculating the central charge of the perturbed
unitary minimal models and the critical exponents of phi^4 theory in three
dimensions. We obtain approximate values for the central charge which are very
close to the exact values using only a one loop perturbative calculation. For
phi^4 theory we obtain estimates which are within the errors of other more
elaborate approaches.
