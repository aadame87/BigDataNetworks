  We consider ``brane-universes'', where matter is confined to four-dimensional
hypersurfaces (three-branes) whereas one extra compact dimension is felt by
gravity only. We show that the cosmology of such branes is definitely different
from standard cosmology and identify the reasons behind this difference. We
give a new class of exact solutions with a constant five-dimensional radius and
cosmologically evolving brane. We discuss various consequences.
