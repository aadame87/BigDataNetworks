  We construct a topological field theory which, on the one hand, generalizes
BF theories in that there is non-trivial coupling to `topological matter
fields'; and, on the other, generalizes the three-dimensional model of Carlip
and Gegenberg to arbitrary dimensional manifolds. Like the three dimensional
model, the theory can be considered to describe a gravitational field
interacting with topological matter. In particular, in two dimensions, the
model is that of gravity on a torus. In four dimensions, the model is shown to
admit constant curvature black hole solutions.
