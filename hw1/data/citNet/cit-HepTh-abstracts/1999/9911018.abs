  We sketch the main steps of old covariant quantization of bosonic open
strings in a constant $B$ field background. We comment on its space-time
symmetries and the induced effective metric. The low-energy spectrum is
evaluated and the appearance of a new non-commutative gauge symmetry is
addressed.
