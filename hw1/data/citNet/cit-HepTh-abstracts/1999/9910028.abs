  One-dimensional sigma-models with N supersymmetries are considered. For
conventional supersymmetries there must be N-1 complex structures satisfying a
Clifford algebra and the constraints on the target space geometry can be
formulated in terms of these. In the cases in which the complex structures are
simultaneously integrable, a conventional extended superspace formulation is
given, with the geometry determined by a 2-form potential for N=2, by a 1-form
potential for N=3 and a scalar potential for N=4; for N>4 it is given by a
scalar potential satisfying differential constraints. This gives explicit
constructions of models with N=3 but not N=4 supersymmetry and of N=4 models in
which the complex structures do not satisfy a quaternionic algebra.
Generalisations with central terms in the superalgebra are also considered.
