  We calculate the partition functions of the affine Pasquier models on the
cylinder in the continuum limit. We show that the partition function of any
affine model may be expressed in terms of the orbit structure of the affine
Coxeter element of the Weyl group associated with the defining graph of the
model. Some of the consequences of this geometric relationship are explored.
