  We obtain the closed-form absorption probabilities for minimally-coupled
massless scalars propagating in the background of D=5 single-charge and D=4
two-charge black holes. These are the only two examples of extremal black holes
with non-vanishing absorption probabilities that can be solved in closed form
for arbitrary incident frequencies. In both cases, the absorption probability
vanishes when the frequency is below a certain threshold, and we discuss the
connection between this phenomenon and the behaviour of geodesics in these
black hole backgrounds. We also obtain leading-order absorption cross-sections
for generic extremal p-branes, and show that the expression for the
cross-section as a function of frequency coincides with the leading-order
dependence of the entropy on the temperature in the corresponding near-extremal
p-branes.
