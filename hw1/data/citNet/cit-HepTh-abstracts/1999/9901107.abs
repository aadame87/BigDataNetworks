  The numbers of bosonic and fermionic zero modes of multi-pronged strings are
counted in ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory and compared with those of the
IIB string theory. We obtain a nice agreement for the fermionic zero modes,
while our result for the bosonic zero modes differs from that obtained in the
IIB string theory. The possible origin of the discrepancy is discussed
