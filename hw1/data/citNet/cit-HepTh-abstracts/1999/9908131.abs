  We use the massless Thirring model to demonstrate a new approach to
non-perturbative fermion calculations based on the spherical field formalism.
The methods we present are free from the problems of fermion doubling and
difficulties associated with integrating out massless fermions. Using a
non-perturbative regularization, we compute the two-point correlator and find
agreement with the known analytic solution.
