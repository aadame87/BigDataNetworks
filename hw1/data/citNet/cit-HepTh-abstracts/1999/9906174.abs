  It is well-known that is spite of sharing some properties with conventional
particles, topological geons in general violate the spin-statistics theorem. On
the other hand, it is generally believed that in quantum gravity theories
allowing for topology change, using pair creation and annihilation of geons,
one should be able to recover this theorem. In this paper, we take an
alternative route, and use an algebraic formalism developed in previous work.
We give a description of topological geons where an algebra of "observables" is
identified and quantized. Different irreducible representations of this algebra
correspond to different kinds of geons, and are labeled by a non-abelian
"charge" and "magnetic flux". We then find that the usual spin-statistics
theorem is indeed violated, but a new spin-statistics relation arises, when we
assume that the fluxes are superselected. This assumption can be proved if all
observables are local, as is generally the case in physical theories. Finally,
we also show how our approach fits into conventional formulations of quantum
gravity.
