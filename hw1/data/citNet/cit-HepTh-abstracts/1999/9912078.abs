  In this ``experimental'' research, we use known topological recursion
relations in genera-zero, -one, and -two to compute the n-point descendant
Gromov-Witten invariants of P^1 for arbitrary degrees and low values of n. The
results are consistent with the Virasoro conjecture and also lead to explicit
computations of all Hodge integrals in these genera. We also derive new
recursion relations for simple Hurwitz numbers similar to those of Graber and
Pandharipande.
