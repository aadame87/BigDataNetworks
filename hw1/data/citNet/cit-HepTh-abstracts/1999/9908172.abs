  The free energy of a multi-component scalar field theory is considered as a
functional W[G,J] of the free correlation function G and an external current J.
It obeys non-linear functional differential equations which are turned into
recursion relations for the connected Greens functions in a loop expansion.
These relations amount to a simple proof that W[G,J] generates only connected
graphs and can be used to find all such graphs with their combinatoric weights.
A Legendre transformation with respect to the external current converts the
functional differential equations for the free energy into those for the
effective energy Gamma[G,Phi], which is considered as a functional of the free
correlation function G and the field expectation Phi. These equations are
turned into recursion relations for the one-particle irreducible Greens
functions. These relations amount to a simple proof that Gamma[G,J] generates
only one-particle irreducible graphs and can be used to find all such graphs
with their combinatoric weights. The techniques used also allow for a
systematic investigation into resummations of classes of graphs. Examples are
given for resumming one-loop and multi-loop tadpoles, both through all orders
of perturbation theory. Since the functional differential equations derived are
non-perturbative, they constitute also a convenient starting point for other
expansions than those in numbers of loops or powers of coupling constants. We
work with general interactions through four powers in the field.
