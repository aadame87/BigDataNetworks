  A crucial element of scattering theory and the LSZ reduction formula is the
assumption that the coupling vanishes at large times. This is known not to hold
for the theories of the Standard Model and in general such asymptotic dynamics
is not well understood. We give a description of asymptotic dynamics in field
theories which incorporates the important features of weak convergence and
physical boundary conditions. Applications to theories with three and four
point interactions are presented and the results are shown to be completely
consistent with the results of perturbation theory.
