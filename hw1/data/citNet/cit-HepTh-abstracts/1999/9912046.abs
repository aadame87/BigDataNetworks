  The problem of renormalisability of the SU(n) theory with massive gauge
bosons is reinverstigated in the present work. We expound that the quantization
under the Lorentz condition caused by the mass term of the gauge fields leads
to a ghost action which is the same as that of the usual SU(n) Yang-Mills
theory in the Landau gauge. Furthermore, we clarify that the mass term of the
gauge fields cause no additional complexity to the Slavnov-Taylor identity of
the generating functional for the regular vertex functions and does not change
the equations satisfied by the divergent part of this generating functional.
Finally, we prove that the renormalisability of the theory can be deduced from
the renormalisability of the Yang-Mills theory.
