  We present a regularization scheme which respects the supersymmetry and the
maximal background gauge covariance in supersymmetric chiral gauge theories.
When the anomaly cancellation condition is satisfied, the effective action in
the superfield background field method automatically restores the gauge
invariance without counterterms. The scheme also provides a background gauge
covariant definition of composite operators that is especially useful in
analyzing anomalies. We present several applications: The minimal consistent
gauge anomaly; the super-chiral anomaly and the superconformal anomaly; as the
corresponding anomalous commutators, the Konishi anomaly and an anomalous
supersymmetric transformation law of the supercurrent (the ``central
extension'' of N=1 supersymmetry algebra) and of the R-current.
