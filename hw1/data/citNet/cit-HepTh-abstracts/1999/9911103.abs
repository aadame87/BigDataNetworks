  We consider the (2+1)-dimensional gauged Thirring model in the Heisenberg
picture. In this context we evaluate the vacuum polarization tensor as well as
the corrected gauge boson propagator and address the issues of generation of
mass and dynamics for the gauge boson (in the limits of QED$_3$ and Thirring
model as a gauge theory, respectively) due to the radiative corrections.
