  The dynamical content of local AdS supergravity in five dimensions is
discussed. The bosonic sector of the theory contains the vielbein ($e^{a}$),
the spin connection ($\omega ^{ab}$) and internal SU(N) and U(1) gauge fields.
The fermionic fields are complex Dirac spinors ($\psi ^{i}$) in a vector
representation of SU(N). All fields together form a connection 1-form in the
superalgebra SU(2,2|N). For N=4, the symplectic matrix has maximal rank in a
locally AdS background in which the dynamical degrees of freedom can be
identified. The resulting efective theory have different numbers of bosonic and
fermionic degrees of freedom.
