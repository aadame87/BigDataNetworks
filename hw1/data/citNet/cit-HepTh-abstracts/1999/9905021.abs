Title: On Generations
Authors: A. Rivero (U. of Zaragoza)
Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX, small additions
\\
  The well known operator ordering ambiguity could motivate the existence of
generations. This possibility is explored by exploiting the relationship
between ordering and discretization rules. Context is drawn from lattice theory
and non commutative geometry.
