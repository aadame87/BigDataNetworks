  We discuss dualities of the integrable dynamics behind the exact solution to
the N=2 SUSY YM theory. It is shown that T duality in the string theory is
related to the separation of variables procedure in dynamical system. We argue
that there are analogues of S duality as well as 3d mirror symmetry in the
many-body systems of Hitchin type governing low-energy effective actions.
