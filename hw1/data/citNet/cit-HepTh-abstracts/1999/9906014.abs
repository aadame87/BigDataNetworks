  Using a sequence of Bogoliubov transformations, we obtain an exact expression
for the vacuum state of a Dirac field in 2+1 dimensions in presence of a
constant magnetic field. This expression reveals a peculiar two level pairing
structure for any value of the mass m greater than zero. This calculation
clarifies the nature of the condensate in the lowest Landau level whose
existence has been emphasized recently by a several authors.
