  We reconsider the problem of BRST quantization of a mechanics with infinitely
reducible first class constraints. Following an earlier recipe [Phys. Lett. B
381, 105, (1996)], the original phase space is extended by purely auxiliary
variables, the constraint set in the enlarged space being first stage of
reducibility. The BRST charge involving only a finite number of ghost variables
is explicitly constructed.
