  We give a general decomposition of SU(N) connection and derive a generalized
Skyrme-Faddeev action as the effective action of SU(N) QCD in the low energy
limit. The result is obtained by separating the topological degrees which
describes the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degree of gauge
potential, and integrating all the dynamical degrees of SU(N) QCD.
