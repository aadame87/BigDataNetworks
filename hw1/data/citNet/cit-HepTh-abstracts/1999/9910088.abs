Title: A Candidate for Solvable Large N Lattice Gauge Theory in D>2
Authors: Andrey Dubin
Comments: 46 pages

  I propose a class of D\geq{2} lattice SU(N) gauge theories dual to certain
vector models endowed with the local [U(N)]^{D} conjugation-invariance and
Z_{N} gauge symmetry. In the latter models, both the partitition function and
Wilson loop observables depend nontrivially only on the eigenvalues of the
link-variables. Therefore, the vector-model facilitates a master-field
representation of the large N loop-averages in the corresponding induced gauge
system. As for the partitition function, in the limit N->{infinity} it is
reduced to the 2Dth power of an effective one-matrix eigenvalue-model which
makes the associated phase structure accessible. In particular a simple
scaling-condition, that ensures the proper continuum limit of the induced gauge
theory, is proposed. We also derive a closed expression for the large N average
of a generic nonself-intersecting Wilson loop in the D=2 theory defined on an
arbitrary 2d surface.
