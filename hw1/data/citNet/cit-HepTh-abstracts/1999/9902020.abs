  A recent experiment with squeezed light has shown that two-photon absorption
by an atom can occur with a linear intensity dependence. We point out that this
result verifies a prediction made by us more than a decade ago from an analysis
of a nonlocal model of QED. This model had earlier been proposed by us in an ad
hoc manner to interpret certain features of multiphoton double ionization and
above-threshold ionization in an atom placed in a strong laser field ; in this
paper we show that the model can be obtained field- theoretically by demanding
covariance of the field Lagrangian under a nonlocal U(1) gauge transformation.
The model also makes direct contact with squeezed light, and thus allows us to
describe these two completely different scenarios from a unified point of view.
     We obtain a fundamentally new result from our nonlocal QED, namely that
only the past, but not the future, can influence the present - thus
establishing a non-thermodynamic arrow of time at the quantum level. We also
show that correlations within a quantum system should necessarily be of the
EPR-type, a result that agrees with Bell's theorem. These results follow from
the simple requirement of energy conservation in matter-radiation interaction.
Furthermore, we also predict new and experimentally verifiable results on the
basis of our model QED.
