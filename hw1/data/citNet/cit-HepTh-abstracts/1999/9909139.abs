  We investigate the transformation from ordinary gauge field to noncommutative
one which was introduced by N.Seiberg and E.Witten (hep-th/9908142). It is
shown that the general transformation which is determined only by gauge
equivalence has a path dependence in `\theta-space'. This ambiguity is
negligible when we compare the ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld action with the
noncommutative one in the U(1) case, because of the U(1) nature and slowly
varying field approximation. However, in general, in the higher derivative
approximation or in the U(N) case, the ambiguity cannot be neglected due to its
noncommutative structure. This ambiguity corresponds to the degrees of freedom
of field redefinition.
