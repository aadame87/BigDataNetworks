  Motivated by a system consisting of a number of parallel M5-branes, we study
possible local deformations of a chiral two-form in six dimensions. Working to
first order in the coupling constant, this reduces to the study of the local
BRST cohomological group at ghost number zero. We obtain an exhaustive list of
all possible deformations. None of them allows for a satisfactory formulation
of the M5-branes system leading to the conclusion that no local field theory
can describe such a system.
