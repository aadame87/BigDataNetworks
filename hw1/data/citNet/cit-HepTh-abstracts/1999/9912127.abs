  A correspondence between the three-block truncated 11D supergravity and the
8D pure Einstein gravity with two commuting Killing symmetries is discussed.
The Kaluza-Klein two-forms of the 6D theory obtained after dimensional
reduction along the Killing orbits generate the four-form field of supergravity
via an inverse dualization. Thus any solution to the vacuum Einstein equations
in eight dimensions depending on six coordinates have 11D-supergravity
counterparts with the non-trivial four-form field. Using this proposed duality
we derive a new dyon solution of 11D supergravity describing the M2 and
M5-branes intersecting at a point.
