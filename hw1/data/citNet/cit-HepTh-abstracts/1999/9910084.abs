  From the topological properties of a three dimensional vector order
parameter, the topological current of point defects is obtained. One shows that
the charge of point defects is determined by Hopf indices and Brouwer degrees.
The evolution of point defects is also studied. One concludes that there exist
crucial cases of branch processes in the evolution of point defects when the
Jacobian $D(\frac \phi x)=0$.
