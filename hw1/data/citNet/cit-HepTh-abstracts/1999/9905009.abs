  The Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin matrix corresponding to a tetrahedrally
symmetric 3-instanton is calculated. Some small variations of the matrix
correspond to vibrations of the instanton-generated 3-Skyrmion. These
vibrations are decomposed under tetrahedral symmetry and this decomposition is
compared to previous knowledge of the 3-Skyrmion vibration spectrum.
