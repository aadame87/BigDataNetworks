  These lecture notes begin with a review of the first nonleading contributions
to the derivative expansion of the M theory effective action compactified on a
two-torus. The form of these higher-derivative interactions is shown to follow
from ten-dimensional type IIB supersymmetry as well as from one-loop quantum
corrections to classical eleven-dimensional supergravity. The detailed
information concerning D-instanton effects encoded in these terms is related to
the problem of evaluating the Witten index for $N$ D-particles in the type IIA
theory. Using the AdS/CFT conjecture, it also leads to very specific
predictions of multi-instanton contributions in $\cal N=4$ supersymmetric SU(N)
Yang--Mills theory in the limit of strong 't Hooft coupling. [Extended version
