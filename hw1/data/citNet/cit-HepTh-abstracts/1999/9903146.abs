  We propose an uncertainty relation of space-time. This relation is
characterized by GhT \lesssim \delta V, where T and \delta V denote a
characteristic time scale and a spatial volume, respectively. Using this
uncertainty relation, we give qualitative estimations for the entropies of a
black hole and our universe. We obtain qualitative agreements with the known
results. The holographic principle of 't Hooft and Susskind is reproduced. We
also discuss cosmology and give a relation to the cosmic holographic principle
of Fischler and Susskind. However, as for the maximal entropy of a system with
an energy E, we obtain the formula \sqrt{EV/Gh^2}, with V denoting the volume
of the system, which is distinct from the Bekenstein entropy formula ER/h with
R denoting the length scale of the system.
