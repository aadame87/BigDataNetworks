  In the orbifold limit of K3, one can give exact conformal field theory
description of D-branes wrapped on certain non-supersymmetric cycles of K3. We
study the effect of switching on the `non-geometric blow up modes'
corresponding to anti-symmetric tensor gauge field flux through the 2-cycles on
these D-branes. Working to first order in the blow up parameter, we determine
the region of the moduli space in which these D-branes are stable. Across the
boundary of this region, the D-brane wrapped on the non-supersymmetric cycle
decays to a pair of D-branes, each wrapped on a supersymmetric cycle, via a
second order phase transition.
