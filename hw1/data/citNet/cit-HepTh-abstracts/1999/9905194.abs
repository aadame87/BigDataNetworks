  The central charge in the N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory plays an essential role
in the work of Seiberg and Witten as it gives the mass spectrum of the BPS
states of the quantum theory. Our aim in this note is to present a direct
computation of this central charge for the leading order (in a momentum
expansion) of the effective action. We will consider the N=2 Super-Yang-Mills
theory with gauge group SU(2). The leading order of the effective action is
given by the same holomorphic function F appearing in the low energy U(1)
effective action.
