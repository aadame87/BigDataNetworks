  In this paper we present a method of deforming to first order the
stress-tensor and the supercurrent of the superstring corresponding to turning
on NS-NS bosonic fields. Furthermore we discuss the difficulties associated
with turning on spacetime fermions and R-R bosons. We also derive the gauge
symmetries of the massless spacetime fields.
