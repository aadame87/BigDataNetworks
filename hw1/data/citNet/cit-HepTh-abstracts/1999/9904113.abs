  We find, from the toric description of the moduli space of D3-branes on
non-compact six-dimensional singularities $\C^3/\Z_3$ and $\C^3/\Z_5$ in the
blown-down limit, the four-dimensional bases on which these singular spaces are
complex cones, and prove the existence of K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on these
four-dimensional bases. This shows, in particular, that one can use the
horizons obtained from these base spaces by a U(1)-foliation as compact parts
of the target space for Type-IIB string theory with $\ads{5}$ in the context of
the AdS-CFT correspondence.
