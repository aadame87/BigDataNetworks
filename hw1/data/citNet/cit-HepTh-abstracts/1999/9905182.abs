Title: Why General Theory of Relativity Allows the Existence of Only Extremal
  Black Holes

  Supersymmetric String theories find occurrences of extremal Black Holes with
gravitational mass M=Q where Q is the charge (G=c=1). Thus, for the chargeless
cases, they predict M=0. We show that General Theory of Relativity, too,
demands a unique BH mass M=0. And we do this by considering the problem from
various angles, both mathematically and physically. Our analysis may be
understandable even to the readers not having sufficient background in GTR.
Physically, this M=0 result means that, continued gravitational collapse indeed
continues for infinite proper time as the system hopelessly tries to radiate
its entire original mass energy to attain the lowest energy state M=0. Since no
event horizon is formed, the problem of loss of information associated with
creation of finite mass BHs or their evaporation ceases to exist.
