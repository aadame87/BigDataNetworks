  Canonical quantization of three dimensional gravity in the first order
formalism suggests that one should allow singular solutions. This paper
addresses the importance of singular solutions in the path integral approach to
quantum gravity. Using a simple ansatz for the dreibein and the spin connection
in the de-Sitter and the anti-de-Sitter spaces we propose that the sum over the
3D manifolds in the path integral should be extended to include 2D surfaces.
