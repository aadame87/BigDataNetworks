  The question of anyons and fractional statistics in field theories in 2+1
dimensions with Chern-Simons (CS) term is discussed in some detail. Arguments
are spelled out as to why fractional statistics is only possible in two space
dimensions. This phenomenon is most naturally discussed within the framework of
field theories with CS term, hence as a prelude to this discussion I first
discuss the various properties of the CS term. In particular its role as a
gauge field mass term is emphasized. In the presence of the CS term, anyons can
appear in two different ways i.e. either as soliton of the corresponding field
theory or as a fundamental quanta carrying fractional statistics and both
approaches are elaborated in some detail.
