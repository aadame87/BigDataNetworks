  A description of the one-loop approximation formula for the partition
function of a three-dimensional abelian version of the Donaldson-Witten theory
is proposed. The one-loop expression is shown to contain such topological
invariants of a three-dimensional manifold M like the Reidemeister-Ray-Singer
torsion and Betti numbers.
