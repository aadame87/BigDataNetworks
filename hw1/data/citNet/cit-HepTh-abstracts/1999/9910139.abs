  One of the key properties of Dirac operators is the possibility of a
degeneracy of zero modes. For the Abelian Dirac operator in three dimensions
the question whether such multiple zero modes may exist has remained unanswered
until now. Here we prove that the feature of zero mode degeneracy indeed occurs
for the Abelian Dirac operator in three dimensions, by explicitly constructing
a class of Dirac operators together with their multiple zero modes. Further, we
discuss some implications of our results, especially a possible relation to the
topological feature of Hopf maps.
