  Grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops emerging in the London limit
of the effective Abelian-projected theory of the SU(3)-gluodynamics is
investigated in the dilute gas approximation. An essential difference of this
system from the SU(2)-case is the presence of two interacting gases of vortex
loops. Two alternative representations for the partition function of such a
grand canonical ensemble are derived, and one of them, which is a
representation in terms of the integrals over vortex loops, is employed for the
evaluation of the correlators of both kinds of loops in the low-energy limit.
