  We explore the possibility of constructing p-brane world-volume actions with
the requirements of kappa-symmetry and gauge invariance as the only input. In
the process, we develop a general framework which leads to actions
interpolating between Poincare-dual descriptions of the world-volume theories.
The method does not require any restrictions on the on-shell background
configurations or on the dimensions of the branes. After some preliminary
studies of low-dimensional cases we apply the method to the type IIB
five-branes and, in particular, construct a kappa-symmetric action for the type
IIB NS5-brane with a world-volume field content reflecting the fact that the
D1-, D3- and D5-branes can end on it.
