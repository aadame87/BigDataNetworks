  A regular method is suggested for constructing vortex-like solutions with
cylindrical symmetry in the Skyrme-Einstein chiral model. The method is based
on the expansion of metric and field functions in power series with respect to
the two small parameters entering the model. The length mass density of the
vortex is estimated.
