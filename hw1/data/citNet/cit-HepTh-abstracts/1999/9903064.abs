  An effective supergravity description of all instabilities of N_4=4
superstrings is derived. The construction is based on the N_4=4 BPS mass
formula at finite temperature and uses the properties of N_4=4 gauged
supergravity. It provides the boundaries of the various thermal phases in the
non-perturbative moduli space. It also draws a precise picture of the dynamics
in the high-temperature heterotic phase. This brief contribution summarizes
results obtained in collaboration with I. Antoniadis and C. Kounnas.
