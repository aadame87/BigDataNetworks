  A detailed review of recent developments in the topological classification of
D-branes in superstring theory is presented. Beginning with a thorough,
self-contained introduction to the techniques and applications of topological
K-theory, the relationships between the classic constructions of K-theory and
the recent realizations of D-branes as tachyonic solitons, coming from bound
states of higher dimensional systems of unstable branes, are described. It is
shown how the K-theory formalism naturally reproduces the known spectra of BPS
and non-BPS D-branes, and how it can be systematically used to predict the
existence of new states. The emphasis is placed on the new interpretations of
D-branes as conventional topological solitons in other brane worldvolumes, how
the mathematical formalism can be used to deduce the gauge field content on
both supersymmetric and non-BPS branes, and also how K-theory predicts new
relationships between the various superstring theories and their D-brane
spectra. The implementations of duality symmetries as natural isomorphisms of
K-groups are discussed. The relationship with the standard cohomological
classification is presented and used to derive an explicit formula for D-brane
charges. Some string theoretical constructions of the K-theory predictions are
also briefly described.
