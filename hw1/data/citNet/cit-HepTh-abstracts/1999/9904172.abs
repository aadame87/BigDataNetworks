  Recently, a new constraint on the structure of a wide class of strongly
coupled field theories has been proposed. It takes the form of an inequality
limiting the number of degrees of freedom in the infrared description of a
theory to be no larger than the number of underlying, ultraviolet degrees of
freedom. Here we apply this inequality to chiral gauge theories. For some
models we find that it is always satisfied, while for others we find that the
assumption of the validity of the inequality implies a strong additional
restriction on the spectrum of massless composite particles.
