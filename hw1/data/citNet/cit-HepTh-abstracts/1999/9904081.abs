Title: Light-cone Hamiltonian flow for positronium. The numerical solutions
Authors: Elena Gubankova and Gabor Papp
Comments: 28 pages, LaTeX2e, 2 Figures
\\
  The effective Hamiltonian, as obtained from applying the Hamiltonian flow
equations to front form QED, are solved numerically for positronium. Both the
exchange and the annihilation channels are included. The impact of different
similarity functions is explicitly studied. Perfect numerical agreement with
other methods is found.
