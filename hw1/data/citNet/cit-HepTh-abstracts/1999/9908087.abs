  A relativistic quantum field theory is presented for finite density problems
based on the principle of locality. It is found that, in addition to the
conventional ones, a local approach to the relativistic quantum field theories
at both zero and finite density consistent with the violation of Bell like
inequalities should contain, and provide solutions to at least three additional
problems, namely, 1) the statistical gauge invariance 2) the dark components of
the local observables and 3) the fermion statistical blocking effects, base
upon an asymptotic non-thermo ensemble. An application to models are presented
to show the importance of the discussions.
