  We study dynamical aspects of holographic correspondence between d=5 anti-de
Sitter supergravity and $d=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We probe causality and
locality of ambient spacetime from super Yang-Mills theory by studying
transmission of low-energy brane waves via an open string stretched between two
D3-branes in Coulomb branch. By analyzing two relevant physical threshold
scales, we find that causality and locality is encoded in the super Yang-Mills
theory provided infinite tower of long supermultiplet operators are added.
Massive W-boson and dual magnetic monopole behave more properly as extended,
bilocal objects. We also study causal time-delay of low-energy excitation on
heavy quark or meson and find an excellent agreement between anti-de Sitter
supergravity and super Yang-Mills theory descriptions. We observe that strong
`t Hooft coupling dynamics and holographic scale-size relation thereof play a
crucial role to the agreement of dynamical processes.
