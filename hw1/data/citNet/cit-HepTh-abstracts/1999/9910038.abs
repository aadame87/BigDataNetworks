  The zeta and eta-functions associated with massless and massive Dirac
operators, in a D-dimensional (D odd or even) manifold without boundary, are
rigorously constructed. Several mathematical subtleties involved in this
process are stressed, as the intrisic ambiguity present in the definition of
the associated fermion functional determinant in the massless case and, also,
the unavoidable presence (in some situations) of a multiplicative anomaly, that
can be conveniently expressed in terms of the noncommutative residue. The
ambiguity is here seen to disappear in the massive case, giving rise to a phase
of the Dirac determinant - that agrees with very recent calculations appeared
in the mathematical literature - and to a multiplicative anomaly - also in
agreement with other calculations, in the coinciding situations. After
explicit, nontrivial resummation of the mass series expansions involving zeta
and eta functions, the results are expressed in terms of quite simple formulas.
