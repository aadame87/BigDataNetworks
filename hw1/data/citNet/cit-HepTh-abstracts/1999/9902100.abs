  We begin by presenting the superparticle action in the background of N=2, D=4
supergravity coupled to n vector multiplets interacting via an arbitrary
special Kahler geometry. Our construction is based on implementing
kappa-supersymmetry. In particular, our result can be interpreted as the source
term for N=2 BPS black holes with a finite horizon area. When the vector
multiplets can be associated to the complex structure moduli of a Calabi-Yau
manifold, then our 0-brane action can be derived by wrapping 3-branes around
3-cycles of the 3-fold. Our result can be extended to the case of higher
supersymmetry; we explicitly construct the kappa supersymmetric action for a
superparticle moving in an arbitrary N=8 supergravity background with 1/2, 1/4
or 1/8 residual supersymmetry.
