  In the old papers of Ogievetskii and Polubarinov, Hayashi, Kalb and Ramond
the {\it notoph} concept, the longitudinal field originated from the
antisymmetric tensor, has been proposed. In our work we analyze the theory of
antisymmetric tensor field of the second rank from a viewpoint of the
normalization problem. We obtain the 4-potentials and field strengths, which
coincide with those which have been previously obtained in the works of
Ahluwalia and Dvoeglazov. Slightly modifying the Bargmann-Wigner field function
we conclude that it is possible to describe explicitly the degrees of freedom
of the photon and of the {\it notoph} by the same equation. The physical
consequences, such as parity properties of field functions, are discussed,
relations to the previous works are discussed as well. Moreover, we derive
equations for {\it symmetric} tensor of the second rank on the basis of the
same modification of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism, i.e. the equations which
describe dynamical behavior of the fields of maximal spin 2.
