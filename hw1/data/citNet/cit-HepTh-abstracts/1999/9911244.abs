  We analyse the equivalence between topologically massive gauge theory (TMGT)
and different formulations of non-topologically massive gauge theories (NTMGTs)
in the canonical approach. The different NTMGTs studied are St\"uckelberg
formulation of (A) a first order formulation involving one and two form fields,
(B) Proca theory, and (C) massive Kalb-Ramond theory. We first quantise these
reducible gauge systems by using the phase space extension procedure and using
it, identify the phase space variables of NTMGTs which are equivalent to the
canonical variables of TMGT and show that under this the Hamiltonian also get
mapped. Interestingly it is found that the different NTMGTs are equivalent to
different formulations of TMGTs which differ only by a total divergence term.
We also provide covariant mappings between the fields in TMGT to NTMGTs at the
level of correlation function.
