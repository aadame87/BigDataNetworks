  We consider the modified superfield constraints with constant terms for the
D=3, N=2 Goldstone-Maxwell gauge multiplet which contains Goldstone fermions,
real scalar and vector fields. The partial spontaneous breaking N=2 to N=1 is
possible for the non-minimal self-interaction of this modified gauge superfield
including the linear Fayet-Iliopoulos term. The dual description of the partial
breaking in the model of the self-interacting Goldstone chiral superfield is
also discussed.
