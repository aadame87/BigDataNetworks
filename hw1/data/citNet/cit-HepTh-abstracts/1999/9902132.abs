  We study conformally invariant boundary conditions that break part of the
bulk symmetries. A general theory is developped for those boundary conditions
for which the preserved subalgebra is the fixed algebra under an abelian
orbifold group. We explicitly construct the boundary states and reflection
coefficients as well as the annulus amplitudes. Integrality of the annulus
coefficients is proven in full generality.
