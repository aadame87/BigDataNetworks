  In a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), Saveliev and the author showed that there
exits an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the field
equations reduces to a (super) version of Yang's equations which may be solved
by methods inspired by the ones previously developed for self-dual Yang-Mills
equations in four dimensions. Here, the analogy between these latter theories
and the present ones is pushed further by writing down a set of super partial
linear differential equations whose consistency conditions may be derived from
the SUSY Y-M equations in ten dimensions, and which are the analogues of the
Lax pair of Belavin and Zakharov. On the simplest example of the two pole
ansatz, it is shown that the same solution-generating techniques are at work,
as for the derivation of the celebrated multi-instanton solutions carried out
in the late seventies. The present Lax representation, however, is only a
consequence of (instead of being equivalent to) the field equations, in
contrast with the Belavin Zakharov Lax pair.
