Title: New dual relations between quantum field theory and string regimes in
  curved backgrounds

  A {\cal R} "dual" transform is introduced which relates Quantum Field Theory
and String regimes, both in a curved background with D-non compact dimensions.
This operation maps the characteristic length of one regime into the other
(and, as a consequence, mass domains as well). The {\cal R}-transform is not an
assumed or {\it a priori} imposed symmetry but is revealed by the QFT and
String dynamics in curved backgrounds. The Hawking-Gibbons temperature and the
string maximal or critical temperature are {\cal R}-mapped one into the other.
If back reaction of quantum matter is included, Quantum Field Theory and String
phases appear, and {\cal R}-relations between them manifest as well. These
{\cal R}-transformations are explicitly shown in two relevant examples: Black
Hole and de Sitter space times.
