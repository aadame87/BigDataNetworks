  Utilizing the previously established general formalism for quantum symmetry
reduction in the framework of loop quantum gravity the spectrum of the area
operator acting on spherically symmetric states in 4 dimensional pure gravity
is investigated. The analysis requires a careful treatment of partial gauge
fixing in the classical symmetry reduction and of the reinforcement of
SU(2)-gauge invariance for the quantization of the area operator. The
eigenvalues of that operator applied to spherically symmetric spin network
states have the form A_n propor. sqrt{n(n+2)}, n=0,1,2..., giving A_n propor. n
for large n. The result clarifies (and reconciles!) the relationship between
the more complicated spectrum of the general (non-symmetric) area operator in
loop quantum gravity and the old Bekenstein proposal that A_n propor. n.
