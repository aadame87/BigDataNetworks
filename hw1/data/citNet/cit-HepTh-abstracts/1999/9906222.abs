  In this note we discuss dynamical mechanisms for brane stabilization in the
brane world context. In particular, we consider supersymmetry preserving brane
stabilization, and also brane stabilization accompanied by supersymmetry
breaking. These mechanisms are realized in some four dimensional N=1
supersymmetric orientifold models. For illustrative purposes we consider two
explicit orientifold models previously constructed in hep-th/9806008. In both
of these models branes are stabilized at a finite distance from the orientifold
planes. In the first model brane stabilization occurs via supersymmetry
preserving non-perturbative gauge dynamics. In the second model supersymmetry
is dynamically broken, and brane stabilization is due to an interplay between
non-perturbatively generated superpotential and tree-level Kahler potential.
