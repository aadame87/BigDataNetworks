  We consider a (2+1)-dimensional mechanical system with the Lagrangian linear
in the torsion of a light-like curve. We give Hamiltonian formulation of this
system and show that its mass and spin spectra are defined by one-dimensional
nonrelativistic mechanics with a cubic potential. Consequently, this system
possesses the properties typical of resonance-like particles.
