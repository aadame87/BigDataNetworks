  A very brief review is given of some of the developments leading to our
current understanding of black holes in string theory. This is followed by a
discussion of two possible misconceptions in this subject - one involving the
stability of small black holes and the other involving scale radius duality.
Finally, I describe some recent results concerning quasinormal modes of black
holes in anti de Sitter spacetime, and their implications for strongly coupled
conformal field theories (in various dimensions).
