  The production of string charge during a crossing of certain oriented
D-branes is studied. We compute the string charge in the system of a probe
D2-brane and a background D6-brane by use of the equations of motion in the
ten-dimensions. We confirm the creation of string charge as inflow from the
background D6-brane.
