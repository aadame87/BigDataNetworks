Title: A Comment on the Entropy of Strongly Coupled N=4
Authors: N. Itzhaki
Comments: 4 pages, latex, no figures
\\
  We propose a field theory argument, which rests on the non-renormalization of
the two point function of the energy-momentum tensor, why the ratio between the
entropies of strongly coupled and weakly coupled N=4 is of order one.
