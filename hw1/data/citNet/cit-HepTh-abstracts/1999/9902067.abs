  The most general black M5-brane solution of eleven-dimensional supergravity
(with a flat R^4 spacetime in the brane and a regular horizon) is characterized
by charge, mass and two angular momenta. We use this metric to construct
general dual models of large-N QCD (at strong coupling) that depend on two free
parameters. The mass spectrum of scalar particles is determined analytically
(in the WKB approximation) and numerically in the whole two-dimensional
parameter space. We compare the mass spectrum with analogous results from
lattice calculations, and find that the supergravity predictions are close to
the lattice results everywhere on the two dimensional parameter space except
along a special line. We also examine the mass spectrum of the supergravity
Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes and find that the KK modes along the compact D-brane
coordinate decouple from the spectrum for large angular momenta. There are
however KK modes charged under a U(1)xU(1) global symmetry which do not
decouple anywhere on the parameter space. General formulas for the string
tension and action are also given.
