  We express the infinite sum of D-fivebrane instanton corrections to ${\cal
R}^2$ couplings in ${\cal N}=4$ type I string vacua, in terms of an elliptic
index counting 1/2-BPS excitations in the effective $Sp(N)$ brane theory. We
compute the index explicitly in the infrared, where the effective theory is
argued to flow to an orbifold CFT. The form of the instanton sum agrees
completely with the predicted formula from a dual one-loop computation in type
IIA theory on $K3\times T^2$. The proposed CFT provides a proper description of
the whole spectrum of masses, charges and multiplicities for 1/2- and 1/4- BPS
states, associated to bound states of D5-branes and KK momenta. These results
are applied to show how fivebrane instanton sums, entering higher derivative
couplings which are sensitive to 1/4-BPS contributions, also match the
perturbative results in the dual type IIA theory.
