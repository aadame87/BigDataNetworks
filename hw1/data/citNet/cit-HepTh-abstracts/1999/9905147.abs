  We employ a heat kernel expansion to derive an effective action that
describes four dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in the infrared limit. Our
result supports the proposal that at large distances the theory is approximated
by the dynamics of knotted string-like fluxtubes which appear as solitons in
the effective theory.
