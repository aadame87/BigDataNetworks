  We study an extreme non-static limit of 2+1-dimensional QED obtained by
making a dimensional reduction so that all fields are spatially uniform but
time dependent. This dimensional reduction leads to a 0+1-dimensional field
theory that inherits many of the features of the 2+1-dimensional model, such as
Chern-Simons terms, time-reversal violation, an analogue of parity violation,
and global U(2) flavor symmetry. At one-loop level, interactions induce a
Chern-Simons term at finite T with coefficient tanh(beta m_F/2), where m_F is
the fermion mass. The finite temperature two loop self-energies are also
computed, and are non-zero for all temperatures.
