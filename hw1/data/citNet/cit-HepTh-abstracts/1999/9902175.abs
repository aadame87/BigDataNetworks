  New clues for the best understanding of the nature of the symmetry-breaking
mechanism are revealed in this paper. A revision of the standard gauge
transformation properties of Yang-Mills fields, according to a group approach
to quantization scheme, enables the gauge group coordinates to acquire
dynamical content outside the null mass shell. The corresponding extra
(internal) field degrees of freedom are transferred to the vector potentials to
conform massive vector bosons.
