  Following our previous paper (hep-th/9909027), we generalize a supersymmetric
boundary state so that arbitrary configuration of the gauge field coupled to
the boundary of the worldsheet is incorpolated. This generalized boundary state
is BRST invariant and satisfy the non-linear boundary conditions with
non-constant gauge field strength. This boundary state contains divergence
which is identical with the loop divergence in a superstring sigma model. Hence
vanishing of the beta function in the superstring sigma model corresponds to a
well-defined boundary state with no divergence. The coupling of a single closed
superstring massless mode with multiple open string massless modes is encoded
in the boundary state, and we confirm that derivative correction to the D-brane
action in this sector vanishes up to the first non-trivial order
O(alpha'(derivative)^2). Combining T-dualities, we incorpolate also general
configurations of the scalar fields on the D-brane, and construct boundary
states representing branes stuck to another D-brane, with use of BIon
configuration.
