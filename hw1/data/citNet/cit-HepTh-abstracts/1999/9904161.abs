  We obtain local parametrizations of classical non-compact Lie groups where
adjoint invariants under maximal compact subgroups are manifest. Extension to
non compact subgroups is straightforward. As a by-product parametrizations of
the same type are obtained for compact groups. They are of physical interest in
any theory gauge invariant under the adjoint action, typical examples being the
two dimensional gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten-Novikov models where these
coordinatizations become of extreme usefulness to get the background fields
representing the vacuum expectation values of the massless modes of the
associated (super) string theory.
