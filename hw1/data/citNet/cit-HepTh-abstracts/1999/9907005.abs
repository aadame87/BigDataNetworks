Title: On The Equivalence Of Four Dimensional And Two dimensional Field
  Theories

  We investigate the dimensional, the dynamical and the topological structures
of four dimensional Einstein and Yang-Mills theories. It is shown that these
theories are constructed from two dimensional quantities, so that they possess
always a distinguished two dimensional substructure. In this sense the four
dimensional field theories are equivalent to related two dimensional field
theories.
