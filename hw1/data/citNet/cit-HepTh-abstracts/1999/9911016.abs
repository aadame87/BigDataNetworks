Title: Light cone formalism in AdS spacetime
Author: R.R.Metsaev, (Lebedev Physical Institute)
Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX, Talk given at XIV International Workshop on High
  Energy Physics and Quantum Field Theory QFTHEP'99, Moscow, Russia, 27 May - 2

\\
  Light cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter spacetime is described.
We also present light cone reformulation of the boundary conformal field theory
representations. AdS/CFT correspondence between the bulk fields and the
boundary operators is discussed.
