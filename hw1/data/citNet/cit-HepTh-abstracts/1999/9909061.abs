  Aspects of superstring cosmology are reviewed with an emphasis on the
cosmological implications of duality symmetries in the theory. The string
effective actions are summarized and toroidal compactification to four
dimensions reviewed. Global symmetries that arise in the compactification are
discussed and the duality relationships between the string effective actions
are then highlighted. Higher-dimensional Kasner cosmologies are presented and
interpreted in both string and Einstein frames, and then given in dimensionally
reduced forms. String cosmologies containing both non-trivial
Neveu-Schwarz/Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond fields are derived by employing
the global symmetries of the effective actions. Anisotropic and inhomogeneous
cosmologies in four-dimensions are also developed. The review concludes with a
detailed analysis of the pre-big bang inflationary scenario. The generation of
primordial spectra of cosmological perturbations in such a scenario is
discussed. Possible future directions offered in the Horava-Witten theory are
outlined.
