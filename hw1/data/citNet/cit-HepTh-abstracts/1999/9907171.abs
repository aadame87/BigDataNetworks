  We discover a realisation of the affine Lie superalgebra sl(2|1) and of the
exceptional affine superalgebra D(2|1;alpha) as vertex operator extensions of
two affine sl(2) algebras with dual levels (and an auxiliary level 1 sl(2)
algebra). The duality relation between the levels is (k+1)(k'+1)=1. We
construct the representation of sl(2|1) at level k' on a sum of tensor products
of sl(2) at level k, sl(2) at level k' and sl(2) at level 1 modules and
decompose it into a direct sum over the sl(2|1) spectral flow orbit. This
decomposition gives rise to character identities, which we also derive. The
extension of the construction to the affine D(2|1;k') at level k is traced to
properties of sl(2)+sl(2)+sl(2) embeddings into D(2|1;alpha) and their relation
with the dual sl(2) pairs. Conversely, we show how the level k' sl(2)
representations are constructed from level k sl(2|1) representations.
