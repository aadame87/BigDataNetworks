  We examine the dynamics induced on the four dimensional boundary of a five
dimensional anti-deSitter spacetime by the five dimensional Chern-Simons theory
with gauge group the direct product of SO(4,2) with U(1). We show that, given
boundary conditions compatible with the geometry of 5d AdS spacetime in the
asymptotic region, the induced surface theory is the $WZW_4$ model.
