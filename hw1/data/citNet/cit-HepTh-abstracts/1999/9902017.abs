  We propose a modification of the Faddeev-Popov procedure to construct a path
integral representation for the transition amplitude and the partition function
for gauge theories whose orbit space has a non-Euclidean geometry. Our approach
is based on the Kato-Trotter product formula modified appropriately to
incorporate the gauge invariance condition, and thereby equivalence to the
Dirac operator formalism is guaranteed by construction. The modified path
integral provides a solution to the Gribov obstruction as well as to the
operator ordering problem when the orbit space has curvature. A few explicit
examples are given to illustrate new features of the formalism developed. The
method is applied to the Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theory to develop a
nonperturbative functional integral for a quantum Yang-Mills theory. Feynman's
conjecture about a relation between the mass gap and the orbit space geometry
in gluodynamics is discussed in the framework of the modified path integral.
