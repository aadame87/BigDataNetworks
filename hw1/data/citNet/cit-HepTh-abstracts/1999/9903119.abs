  The correlations of the QCD Dirac eigenvalues are studied with use of an
extended chiral random matrix model. The inclusion of spatial dependence which
the original model lacks enables us to investigate the effects of diffusion
modes. We get analytical expressions of level correlation functions with
non-universal behavior caused by diffusion modes which is characterized by
Thouless energy. Pion mode is shown to be responsible for these diffusion
effects when QCD vacuum is considered a disordered medium.
