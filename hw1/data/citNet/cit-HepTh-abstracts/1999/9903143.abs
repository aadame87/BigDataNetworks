  Electrically charged solutions breaking half of the supersymmetry in Anti-De
Sitter four dimensional N=2 supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets are
constructed. These static black holes live in an asymptotic $AdS_4$ space-time.
The Killing spinor, i. e., the spinor for supersymmetry variation is explicitly
constructed for these solutions.
