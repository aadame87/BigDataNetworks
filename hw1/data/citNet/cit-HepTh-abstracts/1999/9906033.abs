  The relation between SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics, originated from the
4-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory under the supposition of spatial
homogeneity of the gauge fields, and the Euler-Calogero-Moser model is
discussed in the framework of Hamiltonian reduction. Two kinds of reductions of
the degrees of freedom are considered: due to the gauge invariance and due to
the discrete symmetry. In the former case, it is shown that after elimination
of the gauge degrees of freedom from the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics the
resulting unconstrained system represents the ID_3 Euler-Calogero-Moser model
with an external fourth-order potential. Whereas in the latter, the IA_6
Euler-Calogero-Moser model embedded in an external potential is derived whose
projection onto the invariant submanifold through the discrete symmetry
coincides again with the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics. Based on this connection,
the equations of motion of the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics in the limit of the
zero coupling constant are presented in the Lax form.
