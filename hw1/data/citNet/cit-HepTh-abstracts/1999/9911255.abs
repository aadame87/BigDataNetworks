  We discuss the general issues and ambiguities involved in matching the exact
results for the low energy effective action of scale invariant N=2
supersymmetric QCD to those obtained by instanton methods. We resolve the
reported disagreements and verify agreement between an infinite series of
coefficients in the low energy effective actions calculated in the two
approaches. In particular, we show that the exact low-energy effective
couplings for SU(N) for all N with 2N fundamental hypermultiplets agree at a
special vacuum on the Coulomb branch where a large unbroken discrete global
symmetry makes the matching of parameters relatively straightforward.
