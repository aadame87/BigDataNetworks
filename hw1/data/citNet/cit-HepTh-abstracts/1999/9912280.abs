  A coordinate-free action principle for the N=2 supersymmetric model of spin 0
and spin 1/2 matter fields interacting via Chern-Simons higher spin gauge
fields in AdS3 is formulated in terms of star-product algebra of two
oscillators. Although describing proper relativistic dynamics the action does
not contain space-time coordinates. It is given by a supertrace of a
forth-order polynomial in the 3d higher spin superalgebra. The theory admits a
free parameter characterizing the inequivalent vacua associated with the
parameter of mass m of the matter fields. For the case of the massless matter,
the model has a form of the noncommutative 2d Yang-Mills theory with some
infinite-dimensional gauge group. The limit m\to\infty corresponds to the
SU(\infty) 2d Yang-Mills theory.
