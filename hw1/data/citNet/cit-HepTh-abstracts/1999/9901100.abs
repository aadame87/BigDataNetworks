Title: Spherical gauge fields
Authors: Bugra Borasoy and Dean Lee
Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B447 (1999) 98
\\
  We introduce the spherical field formalism for free gauge fields. We discuss
the structure of the spherical Hamiltonian for both general covariant gauge and
radial gauge and point out several new features not present in the scalar field
case. We then use the evolution equations to compute gauge-field and
field-strength correlators.
