  We derive D-brane gauge theories for C^3/Z_n x Z_n orbifolds with discrete
torsion and study the moduli space of a D-brane at a point. We show that, as
suggested in previous work, closed string moduli do not fully resolve the
singularity, but the resulting space -- containing n-1 conifold singularities
-- is somewhat surprising. Fractional branes also have unusual properties.
  We also define an index which is the CFT analog of the intersection form in
geometric compactification, and use this to show that the elementary D6-brane
wrapped about T^6/Z_n x Z_n must have U(n) world-volume gauge symmetry.
