Title: Relativistic particle interaction with a weak electromagnetic field

\\
  Schrodinger equation with two-component wave function which describes a
relativistic spin 1/2 particle in a weak electromagnetic field is obtained. In
the same approximation Schrodinger equation with traditional norm condition and
one-component wave function for a spinless particle is obtained as well. To
construct it Foldy-Wouthuysen procedure with the electron charge value as the
small parameter is used.
