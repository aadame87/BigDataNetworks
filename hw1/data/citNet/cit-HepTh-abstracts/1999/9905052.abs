Title: Non Supersymmetric Vacua and the D-flatness Condition
Authors: Gustavo Dotti
Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Some N=1 gauge theories, including SQED and N_F=1 SQCD have the property
that, for arbitrary superpotentials, all stationary points of the potential V =
F+D are D-flat. For others, stationary points of V are complex gauge
transformationss of D-flat configurations. As an implication, the technique to
parametrize the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua in terms of a set of basic
holomorphic G invariants can be extended to non-supersymmetric vacua. A similar
situation is found in non-gauge theories with a compact global symmetry group.
