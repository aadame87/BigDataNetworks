  We review the calculation of the spectrum of glueball masses in
non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the conjectured duality between
supergravity and large N gauge theories. The glueball masses are obtained by
solving the supergravity wave equations in a black hole geometry. The glueball
masses found this way are in unexpected agreement with the available lattice
data. We also show how to use a modified version of the duality based on
rotating branes to calculate the glueball mass spectrum with some of the
Kaluza-Klein states of the supergravity theory decoupled from the spectrum.
