  A compactification of 11-dimensional supergravity with two (or more) walls is
considered. The whole tower of massive Kaluza-Klein modes along the fifth
dimension is taken into account. With the sources on the walls, an explicit
composition in terms of Kaluza-Klein modes of massless gravitino (in the
supersymmetry preserving case) and massive gravitino (in the supersymmetry
breaking case) is obtained. The super-Higgs effect is discussed in detail.
