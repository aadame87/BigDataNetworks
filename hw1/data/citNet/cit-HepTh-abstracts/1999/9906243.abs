  We study the mechanism of confinement via formation of
Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices on the Higgs branch of N=2 supersymmetric
SU(2) gauge theory with massive fundamental matter. Higgs branch represents a
limiting case of superconductor of type I with vanishing Higgs mass. We show
that in this limit vortices still exist although they become logarithmically
"thick". Because of this the confining potential is not linear any longer. It
behaves as $L/\log L$ with a distance $L$ between confining heavy charges
(monopoles). This new confining regime can occur only in supersymmetric
theories. We also address the problem of quantum stability of vortices. To this
end we develop string representation for a vortex and use it to argue that
vortices remain stable.
