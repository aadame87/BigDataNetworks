  A magnetic monopole is placed at the centre of a 3-ball whose surface, S, is
tiled by the symmetry group, G, of a regular solid. The quantum mechanics on
the two-dimensional quotient, S/G, is developed and the monopole charge is
found to be quantized in the expected manner. The heat-kernels and
zeta-functions are evaluated and the Casimir energies computed as examples of
the formalism. Numerical approaches to the calculation of the derivative of the
Barnes zeta-function are presented.
