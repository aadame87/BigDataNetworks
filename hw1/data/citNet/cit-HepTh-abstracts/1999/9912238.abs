  The geometric picture of the star-product based on its Fourier representation
kernel is utilized in the evaluation of chains of star-products and the
intuitive appreciation of their associativity and symmetries. Such
constructions appear even simpler for a variant asymmetric product, and carry
through for the standard star-product supersymmetrization.
