  We discuss, in terms of the AdS_3-CFT_2 correspondence, a one-parameter
family of (asymptotically AdS_3) conical geometries which are generated by
point masses and interpolate between AdS_3 and BTZ spacetimes. We show that
these correspond to spectral flow in N= (4,4) SCFT_2 which interpolate between
NS and R sectors. Our method involves representing the conical spaces as
solutions of three-dimensional supergravity based on the supergroup SU(1,1|2)
\times SU(1,1|2). The boundary CFT we use is based on the D1/D5 system. The
correspondence includes comparing the Euclidean free energies between
supergravity and SCFT for the family of conical spaces including BTZ black
holes.
