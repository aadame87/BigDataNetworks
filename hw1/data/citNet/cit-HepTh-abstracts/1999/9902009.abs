  The master equation is quantized. This is an example of quantization of a
gauge theory with nilpotent generators. No ghosts are needed for a generation
of the gauge algebra. The point about the nilpotent generators is that one
can't write down a single functional integral for this theory. One has to write
down a product of two coupled functional integrals and take a square root. In
the special gauge where the gauge conditions are commuting, the functional
integrals decouple, and one recovers the known result.
