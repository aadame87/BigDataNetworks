  In a nontrivial background geometry with extra dimensions, gravitational
effects will depend on the shape of the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the
graviton. We investigate a consistent scenario of this type with two positive
tension three-branes separated in a five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter geometry.
The graviton is localized on the ``Planck'' brane, while a gapless continuum of
additional gravity eigenmodes probe the {\it infinitely} large fifth dimension.
Despite the background five-dimensional geometry, an observer confined to
either brane sees gravity as essentially four-dimensional up to a
position-dependent strong coupling scale, no matter where the brane is located.
We apply this scenario to generate the TeV scale as a hierarchically suppressed
mass scale. Arbitrarily light gravitational modes appear in this scenario, but
with suppressed couplings. Real emission of these modes is observable at future
colliders; the effects are similar to those produced by {\it six} large
toroidal dimensions.
