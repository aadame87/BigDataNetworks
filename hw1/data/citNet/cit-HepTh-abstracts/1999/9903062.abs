  We present a simple and systematic method to calculate the Rindler noise,
which is relevant to the analysis of the Unruh effect, by using the
fluctuation-dissipative theorem. To do this, we calculate the dissipative
coefficient explicitly from the equations of motion of the detector and the
field. This method gives not only the correct answer but also a hint as to the
origin of the apparent statistics inversion effect. Moreover, this method is
generalized to the Dirac field, by using the fermionic fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. We can thus confirm that the fermionic fluctuation-dissipation theorem
is working properly.
