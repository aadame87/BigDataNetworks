  We study the perturbation expansion of the free energy of N=4 supersymmetric
SU(N) Yang-Mills at finite temperature in powers of 't Hooft's coupling g^2 N
in the large N limit. Infrared divergences are controlled by constructing a
hierarchy of two 3 dimensional effective field theories. This procedure is
applied to the calculation of the free energy to order (g^2 N)^(3/2), but it
can be extended to higher order corrections.
