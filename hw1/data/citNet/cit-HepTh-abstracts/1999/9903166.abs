  A class of background independent membrane field theories are studied, and
several properties are discovered which suggest that they may play a role in a
background independent form of M theory. The bulk kinematics of these theories
are described in terms of the conformal blocks of an algebra G on all oriented,
finite genus, two-surfaces. The bulk dynamics is described in terms of causal
histories in which time evolution is specified by giving amplitudes to certain
local changes of the states. Holographic observables are defined which live in
finite dimensional states spaces associated with boundaries in spacetime. We
show here that the natural observables in these boundary state spaces are, when
G is chosen to be Spin(D) or a supersymmetric extension of it, generalizations
of matrix model coordinates in D dimensions. In certain cases the bulk dynamics
can be chosen so the matrix model dynamics is recoverd for the boundary
observables. The bosonic and supersymmetric cases in D=3 and D=9 are studied,
and it is shown that the latter is, in a certain limit, related to the matrix
model formulation of M theory. This correspondence gives rise to a conjecture
concerning a background independent form of M theory in terms of which
excitations of the background independent membrane field theory that correspond
to strings and D0 branes are identified.
