  We consider general properties of central charges of zero branes and
associated duality invariants, in view of their double role, on the bulk and on
the world volume (quantum-mechanical) theory. A detailed study of the BPS
condition for the mass spectrum arising from toroidal compactifications is
given for 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 BPS states in any dimensions. As a byproduct, we
retreive the U-duality invariant conditions on the charge (zero mode) spectrum
and the orbit classification of BPS states preserving different fractions of
supersymmetry. The BPS condition for 0-branes in theories with 16
supersymmetries in any dimension is also discussed.
