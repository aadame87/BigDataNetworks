  The existence of a ground ring of ghost number zero operators in the chiral
BRST cohomology of the N=2 string is used to derive an infinite set of Ward
identities for the closed-string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary genus.
These identities are sufficient to rederive the well known vanishing theorem
for loop amplitudes with more than three external legs.
