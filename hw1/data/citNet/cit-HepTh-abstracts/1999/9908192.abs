  We examine the behaviour of Killing spinors on AdS5 under various discrete
symmetries of the spacetime. In this way we discover a number of supersymmetric
orbifolds, reproducing the known ones and adding a few novel ones to the list.
These orbifolds break the SO(4,2) invariance of AdS5 down to subgroups. We also
make some comments on the non-compact Stiefel manifold W{4,2}.
