  The cancellation of U(1)-gauge and U(1)-gravitational anomalies in certain
D=4 N=1 Type IIB orientifolds is analyzed in detail, from a string theory point
of view. We verify the proposal that these anomalies are cancelled by a
Green-Schwarz mechanism involving only twisted Ramond-Ramond fields. By
factorizing one-loop partition functions, we also get the anomalous couplings
of D-branes, O-planes and orbifold fixed-points to these twisted fields.
Twisted sectors with fixed-planes participate to the inflow mechanism in a
peculiar way.
