  We introduce a notion of Q-algebra that can be considered as a generalization
of the notion of Q-manifold (a supermanifold equipped with an odd vector field
obeying {Q,Q} =0). We develop the theory of connections on modules over
Q-algebras and prove a general duality theorem for gauge theories on such
modules. This theorem contains as a simplest case SO(d,d,{\bf Z})-duality of
gauge theories on noncommutative tori.
