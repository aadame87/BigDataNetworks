  A solution to the long-standing problem of identifying the conformal field
theory governing the transition between quantized Hall plateaus of a disordered
noninteracting 2d electron gas, is proposed. The theory is a nonlinear sigma
model with a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term, and fields taking values in a
Riemannian symmetric superspace based on H^3 x S^3. Essentially the same
conformal field theory appeared in very recent work on string propagation in
AdS_3 backgrounds. We explain how the proposed theory manages to obey a number
of tight constraints, two of which are constancy of the partition function and
noncriticality of the local density of states. An unexpected feature is the
existence of a truly marginal deformation, restricting the extent to which
universality can hold in critical quantum Hall systems. The marginal coupling
is fixed by matching the short-distance singularity of the conductance between
two interior contacts to the classical conductivity sigma_xx = 1/2 of the
Chalker-Coddington network model. For this value, perturbation theory predicts
a critical exponent 2/pi for the typical point-contact conductance, in
agreement with numerical simulations. The irrational exponent is tolerated by
the fact that the symmetry algebra of the field theory is Virasoro but not
affine Lie algebraic.
