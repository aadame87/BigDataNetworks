  We consider the question of gauge invariance of the Wilson loop in the light
of a new treatment of axial gauge propagator proposed recently based on a
finite field-dependent BRS (FFBRS) transformation. We remark that as under the
FFBRS transformation the vacuum expectation value of a gauge invariant
observable remains unchanged, our prescription automatically satisfies the
Wilson loop criterion. Further, we give an argument for {\it direct}
verification of the invariance of Wilson loop to O(g^4) using the earlier work
by Cheng and Tsai. We also note that our prescription preserves the thermal
Wilson loop to O(g^2).
