Title: Domain walls junctions from a distance
Authors: Daniele Binosi
Comments: Revtex, 2 pages, no figures. Major change with respect to the Ansatz
  of Carrol et al.: the results of Sec. VI of hep-th/9905217 has to be
  considered correct
\\
  It is pointed out that it is very unlikely that we can find analytical
solutions built up from elementary functions for the domain wall junctions
problem in Wess-Zumino models possessing a trivial Kahler potential.
