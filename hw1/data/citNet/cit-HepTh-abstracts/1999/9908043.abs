  The non-perturbative renormalization group equation for the Wilsonian
effective potential is given in a certain simple approximation scheme in order
to study chiral symmetry breaking phenomena dynamically induced by strong gauge
interactions. The evolving effective potential is found to be non-analytic in
infrared, which indicates spontaneous generation of the fermion mass. It is
also shown that the renormalization group equation gives the identical
effective fermion mass with that obtained by solving the Schwinger-Dyson
equation in the (improved) ladder approximation. Moreover introduction of the
collective field corresponding to the fermion composite into the theory space
is found to offer an efficient method to evaluate the order parameters; the
dynamical mass and the chiral condensate. The relation between the
renormalization group equation incorporating the collective field and the
Schwinger-Dyson equation is also clarified.
