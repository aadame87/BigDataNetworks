  The holographic connection between large $N$ Super Yang Mills theory and
gravity in anti deSitter space requires unfamiliar behavior of the SYM theory
in the limit that the curvature of the AdS geometry becomes small. The
paradoxical behavior includes superluminal oscillations and negative energy
density. These effects typically occur in the SYM description of events which
take place far from the boundary of AdS when the signal from the event arrives
at the boundary. The paradoxes can be resolved by assuming a very rich
collection of hidden degrees of freedom of the SYM theory which store
information but give rise to no local energy density. These degrees of freedom,
called precursors, are needed to make possible sudden apparently acausal energy
momentum flows. Such behavior would be impossible in classical field theory as
a consequence of the positivity of the energy density. However we show that
these effects are not only allowed in quantum field theory but that we can
model them in free quantum field theory.
