  A conformal field theory on the boundary of three-dimensional asymptotic
anti-de Sitter spaces which appear as near horizon geometry of D-brane bound
states is discussed. It is shown that partition functions of gravitational
instantons appear as high and low temperature limits of the partition function
of the conformal field theory. The result reproduces phase transition between
the anti-de Sitter space and the BTZ black hole in the bulk gravity.
