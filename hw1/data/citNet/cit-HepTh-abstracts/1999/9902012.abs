  String vacua for non critical strings satisfying the requirements of Zig-Zag
invariance are constructed. The Liouville mode is shown to play the r\^ole of
scale in the Renormalization Group operation. Differences and similarities with
the D-brane near horizon approach to non supersymmetric gauge theories are
discussed as well.
