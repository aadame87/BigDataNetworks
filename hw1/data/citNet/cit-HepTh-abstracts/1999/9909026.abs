  Noncommutative geometry(NCG) on the discrete space successfully reproduces
the Higgs mechanism of the spontaneously broken gauge theory, in which the
Higgs boson field is regarded as a kind of gauge field on the discrete space.
We could construct the generalized differential geometry(GDG) on the discrete
space $M_4\times Z_N$ which is very close to NCG in case of $M_4\times Z_2$.
GDG is a direct generalization of the differential geometry on the ordinary
manifold into the discrete one. In this paper, we attempt to construct the BRST
invariant formulation of spontaneously broken gauge theory based on GDG and
obtain the BRST invariant Lagrangian with the t'Hooft-Feynman gauge fixing
term.
