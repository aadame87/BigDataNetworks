  The dynamics and evolution of Bianchi type I space-times is considered in the
framework of the four-dimensional truncation of a reduced theory obtained from
the N=2,D=5 supergravity. The general solution of the gravitational field
equations can be represented in an exact parametric form. All solutions have a
singular behavior at the initial/final moment, except when the space-time
geometry reduces to the isotropic flat case. Generically the obtained
cosmological models describe an anisotropic, expanding or collapsing, singular
Universe with a non-inflationary evolution for all times.
