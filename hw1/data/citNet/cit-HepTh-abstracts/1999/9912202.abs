  It is shown how $W$-algebras emerge from very peculiar canonical
transformations with respect to the canonical symplectic structure on a compact
Riemann surface. The action of smooth diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle
on suitable generating functions is written in the BRS framework while a
$W$-symmetry is exhibited. Subsequently, the complex structure of the symmetry
spaces is studied and the related BRS properties are discussed. The specific
example of the so-called $W_3$-algebra is treated in relation to some other
different approaches.
