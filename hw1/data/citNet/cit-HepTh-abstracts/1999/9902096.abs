  We obtain a generally covariant conservation law of energy-momentum for
gravitational anyons by the general displacement transform. The energy-momentum
currents have also superpotentials and are therefore identically conserved. It
is shown that for Deser's solution and Clement's solution, the energy vanishes.
The reasonableness of the definition of energy-momentum may be confirmed by the
solution for pure Einstein gravity which is a limit of vanishing Chern-Simons
coulping of gravitational anyons.
