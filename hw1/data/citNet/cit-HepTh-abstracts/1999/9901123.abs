  Using free world-sheet fermions, we construct and classify all the N=2, Z2 X
Z2 four-dimensional orbifolds of the type IIA/B strings for which the orbifold
projections act symmetrically on the left and right movers. We study the
deformations of these models out of the fermionic point, deriving the partition
functions at a generic point in the moduli of the internal torus T6=T2 X T2 X
T2. We investigate some of their perturbative and non-perturbative dualities
and construct new dual pairs of type IIA/type II asymmetric orbifolds, which
are related non-perturbatively and allow us to gain insight into some of the
non-perturbative properties of the type IIA/B strings in four dimensions. In
particular, we consider some of the (non-)perturbative gravitational
corrections.
