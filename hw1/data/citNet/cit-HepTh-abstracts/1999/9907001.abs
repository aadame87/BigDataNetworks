  We present a short and direct derivation of Hawking radiation as a tunneling
process, based on particles in a dynamical geometry. The imaginary part of the
action for the classically forbidden process is related to the Boltzmann factor
for emission at the Hawking temperature. Because the derivation respects
conservation laws, the exact spectrum is not precisely thermal. We compare and
contrast the problem of spontaneous emission of charged particles from a
charged conductor.
