  We discuss topologically stable solitons in two-dimensional theories with the
extended supersymmetry assuming that the spatial coordinate is compact. This
problem arises in the consideration of the domain walls in the popular theories
with compactified extra dimensions. Contrary to naive expectations, it is shown
that the solitons on the cylinder can be BPS saturated. In the case of one
chiral superfield, a complete theory of the BPS saturated solitons is worked
out. We describe the classical solutions of the BPS equations. Depending on the
choice of the Kahler metric, the number of such solutions can be arbitrarily
large. Although the property of the BPS saturation is preserved order by order
in perturbation theory, nonperturbative effects eliminate the majority of the
classical BPS states upon passing to the quantum level. The number of the
quantum BPS states is found. It is shown that the N=2 field theory includes an
auxiliary N=1 quantum mechanics, Witten's index of which counts the number of
the BPS particles.
