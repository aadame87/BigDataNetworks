  Differential realizations in coordinate space for deformed Lie algebras with
three generators are obtained using bosonic creation and annihilation operators
satisfying Heisenberg commutation relations. The unified treatment presented
here contains as special cases all previously given coordinate realizations of
$so(2,1),so(3)$ and their deformations. Applications to physical problems
involving eigenvalue determination in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics are
discussed.
