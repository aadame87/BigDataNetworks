  We present the algebraic framework for the quantization of the classical
bosonic charge algebra of maximally extended (N=16) supergravity in two
dimensions, thereby taking the first steps towards an exact quantization of
this model. At the core of our construction is the Yangian algebra $Y(e_8)$
whose RTT presentation we discuss in detail. The full symmetry algebra is a
centrally extended twisted version of the Yangian double $DY(e_8)_c$. We show
that there exists only one special value of the central charge for which the
quantum algebra admits an ideal by which the algebra can be divided so as to
consistently reproduce the classical coset structure $E_{8(8)}/SO(16)$ in the
limit $\hbar\to 0$.
