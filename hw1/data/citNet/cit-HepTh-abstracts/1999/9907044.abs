  We present a method for a recursive graphical construction of Feynman
diagrams with their correct multiplicities in quantum electrodynamics. The
method is first applied to find all diagrams contributing to the vacuum energy
from which all n-point functions are derived by functional differentiation with
respect to electron and photon propagators, and to the interaction. Basis for
our construction is a functional differential equation obeyed by the vacuum
energy when considered as a functional of the free propagators and the
interaction. Our method does not employ external sources in contrast to
traditional approaches.
