  We present a brief historical overview of the classical theory of a radiating
point charge, described by the Lorentz-Dirac equation. A recent development is
the discovery of tunnelling of a charge through a potential barrier, in a
completely classical context. Also, a concrete example is discussed of the
existence of several physically acceptable solutions for a range of initial
data. We end by pointing out some open problems in connection with D-brane and
monopole physics.
