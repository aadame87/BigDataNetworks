  We study a massive Thirring-like model in 2-dimensional space-time, which
contains fermions with arbitrary number (N) of different species. This model is
an extension of that of a previous paper, where we have considered two-species
case. By this extension we expect that we can expose more general structures of
this kind of model. We obtain the equivalent boson model with N species to our
fermion model. We find that the coupling constant must be set in some regions
in order for the model to be physically sensible. It seems hard to find such
regions from direct obsavation of the original fermion model. We also find that
for specific values of the coupling constant some of the boson fields disappear
from the system. Therefore, the N-species fermion model is described by the
boson model with fewer species.
