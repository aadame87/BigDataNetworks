  The curvature scalar -R/const in the Einstein-Gilbert action can be replaced
by the energy-momentum scalar of the matter T. This additional energy term in
Lagrangians of particles and fields does not disappear on a flat space-time and
can be considered as a gravitational self energy. It is shown that this term in
Lagrangians of quantum fields naturally induces renormalizational counterterms.
As a result additional counterterms are not needed in introduction.
