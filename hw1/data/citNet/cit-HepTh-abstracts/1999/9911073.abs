  Using the known propagator equations for 0,1 and 2 forms in AdS_{d+1}, we
find the p-form field propagator equations in dimensions where the forms are
Poincare dual. Since the general equation obeyed by the propagators is linear
in dimension, this gives us the equation obeyed by the propagators for any d.
Furthermore, based on the Poincare duality formulas for 0,1,2 and 3 forms we
conjecture the general form of the Poincare duality formulas, and check them
against the previously found propagator equations. The whole structure is
self-consistent. Once we have the equations, we can easily obtain all the
p-form field propagators in AdS_{d+1}. The generalization to massive p-forms
can also be easily done.
