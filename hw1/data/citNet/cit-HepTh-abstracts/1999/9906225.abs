  We develop a general framework for quantum field theory on noncommutative
spaces, i.e., spaces with quantum group symmetry. We use the path integral
approach to obtain expressions for $n$-point functions. Perturbation theory
leads us to generalised Feynman diagrams which are braided, i.e., they have
non-trivial over- and under-crossings. We demonstrate the power of our approach
by applying it to $\phi^4$-theory on the quantum 2-sphere. We find that the
basic divergent diagram of the theory is regularised.
