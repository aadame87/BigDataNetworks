Title: Some Generalized BRS Transformations.I The Pure Yang-Mills Case
Authors: Paul Federbush (Univ. of Michigan)
Comments: 6 pages. LaTeX
\\
  Some generalized BRS transformations are developed for the pure Yang-Mills
theory, and a form of quantum gravity. Unlike the usual BRS transformations:
these are nonlocal; may be infinite formal power series in the gauge fields;
and do not leave the action invariant, but only the product exp(-S) with the
Jacobian. Similar constructions should exist for many other field theory
situations.
