  The quantum Anti-de Sitter (AdS) group and quantum AdS space is discussed.
Ways of getting the quantum AdS group from real forms of quantum orthogonal
group are presented. Differential calculus on the quantum AdS space are also
introduced. In particular, reality of differential calculus are given. We set
up explicit relationships between quantum group and quantum algebra, which can
be refereed as the quantum counterpart of the classical exponential. By this
way, quantum AdS algebra is deduced from conjugation on the quantum AdS group.
