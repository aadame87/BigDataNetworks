  We explicitly construct BPS domain walls interpolating between neighboring
chirally asymmetric vacua in a model for large N pure supersymmetric QCD. The
BPS equations for the corresponding ${\bf Z}_N$ symmetric order parameter
effective Lagrangian reduce to those in the $A_N$ Landau-Ginsburg model
assuming that the higher derivative terms in the K{\"a}hler potential are
suppressed in the large N limit. These BPS domain walls, which have vanishing
width in the large N limit, can be viewed as supermembranes embedded in a
(3+1)-dimensional supersymmetric QCD background. The supermembrane couples to a
three-form supermultiplet whose components we identify with the composite
fields of supersymmetric QCD. We also discuss certain aspects of chromoelectric
flux tubes (open strings) ending on these walls which appear to support their
interpretation as D-branes.
