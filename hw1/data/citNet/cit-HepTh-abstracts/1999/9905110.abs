  In this paper, fermions are minimally coupled to 3D-gravity where a dynamical
torsion is introduced. A Kalb-Ramond field is non-minimally coupled to these
fermions in a gauge-invariant way. We show that a 1-loop mass generation
mechanism takes place for both the 2-form gauge field and the torsion. As for
the fermions, no mass is dynamically generated: at 1-loop, there is only a mass
shift proportional to the Yukawa coupling whenever the fermions have a
non-vanishing tree-level mass.
