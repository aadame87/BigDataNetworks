  In the present paper we study SU(N)->S(U(N/2)xU(N/2)) symmetry breaking in
N=4 SYM via AdS/CFT correspondence. We consider two stacks of N/2 parallel D3
branes separated by a distance 2\vec d. In this case there is mixing between
the different l-wave dilatonic KK modes. We calculate certain the two point
correlation functions in the dual gauge theory. Due to mode mixing, the
diagonal correlation functions have 1/N conformal-like correction as well as
deformation terms. The off-diagonal correlators are also non-vanishing and
their leading order is 1/N. We discuss briefly the spectrum of the glueball
exitations.
