  By making use of the Abelian projection method, a dual version of the
SU(2)-gluodynamics with manifest monopole-like excitations, arising from the
integration over singular gauge transformations, is formulated in the continuum
limit. The resulting effective theory emerges due to the summation over the
grand canonical ensemble of these excitations in the dilute gas approximation.
As a result, the dual Abelian gauge boson acquires a nonvanishing (magnetic)
mass due to the Debye screening effects in such a gas. The obtained theory is
then used for the construction of the corresponding effective potential of
monopole loop currents and the string representation. Finally, by virtue of
this representation, confining properties of the SU(2)-gluodynamics are
emphasized.
