  An algebraic method is devised to look for non-local symmetries of the
pseudopotential type of nonlinear field equations. The method is based on the
use of an infinite-dimensional subalgebra of the prolongation algebra $L$
associated with the equations under consideration. Our approach, which is
applied by way of example to the Dym and the Korteweg-de Vries equations,
allows us to obtain a general formula for the infinitesimal operator of the
non-local symmetries expressed in terms of elements of $L$. The method could be
exploited to investigate the symmetry properties of other nonlinear field
equations possessing nontrivial prolongations.
