  It is shown that the auxiliary field in the low-energy effective theory of
the supersymmetric QCD (SU(N_c) gauge symmetry with flavors N_f < N_c) can be
understood as a physical degree of freedom, once the supersymmetry is
explicitly broken. Although the vacuum expectation value of the auxiliary field
is just a measure of the supersymmetry breaking in the perturbative treatment
of the supersymmetry breaking, it can be the vacuum expectation value of the
quark bilinear operator in the non-perturbative treatment of the supersymmetry
breaking. We show that the vacuum expectation value remains finite in the limit
of the infinite supersymmetry-breaking mass of the squark. We have to take the
large N_c limit simultaneously to keep the low-energy effective Kaehler
potential being in good approximation.
