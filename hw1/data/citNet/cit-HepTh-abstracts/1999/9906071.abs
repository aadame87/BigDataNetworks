  Some of the consequences of Eyvind Wichmann's contributions to modular theory
and the QFT phase-space structure are presented. In order to show the power of
those ideas in contemporary problems, I selected the issue of algebraic
holography as well as a new nonperturbative constructive approach (based on the
modular structur of wedge-localized algebras and modular inclusions) and show
that these ideas are recent consequences of the pathbreaking work which
Wichmann together with his collaborator Bisognano initiated in the mid
70$^{ies}.
