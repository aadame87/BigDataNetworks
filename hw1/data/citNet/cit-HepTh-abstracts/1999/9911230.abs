  Asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times are considered in a general
dimension $d\ge 4$. As one might expect, the boundary conditions at infinity
ensure that the asymptotic symmetry group is the anti-de Sitter group (although
there is an interesting subtlety if d=4). Asymptotic field equations imply
that, associated with each generator $\xi$ of this group, there is a quantity
$Q_\xi$ which satisfies the expected `balance equation' if there is flux of
physical matter fields across the boundary $\I$ at infinity and is absolutely
conserved in absence of this flux. Irrespective of the dimension d, all these
quantities vanish if the space-time under considerations is (globally) anti-de
Sitter. Furthermore, this result is required by a general covariance argument.
However, it contradicts some of the recent findings based on the conjectured
ADS/CFT duality. This and other features of our analysis suggest that, if a
consistent dictionary between gravity and conformal field theories does exist
in fully non-perturbative regimes, it would have to be more subtle than the one
used currently.
