  BPS electric and magnetic black hole solutions which break half of
supersymmetry in the theory of N=2 five-dimensional supergravity are discussed.
For models which arise as compactifications of M-theory on a Calabi-Yau
manifold, these solutions correspond, respectively, to the two and five branes
wrapping around the homology cycles of the Calabi-Yau compact space. The
electric solutions are reviewed and the magnetic solutions are constructed. The
near-horizon physics of these solutions is examined and in particular the
phenomenon of the enhancement of supersymmetry. The solutions for the
supersymmetric Killing spinor of the near horizon geometry, identified as
$AdS_{3}\times S^{2}$ and $AdS_{2} \times S^{3}$ are also given.
