  We investigate two-loop quantum corrections to non-minimally coupled
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. The non-minimal gauge interaction represents the
magnetic moment interaction between the charged scalar and the electromagnetic
field. We show that the one-loop renormalizability of the theory found in
previous work does not survive to the two-loop level. However, with an
appropriate choice of the non-minimal coupling constant, it is possible to
renormalize the two-loop effective potential and hence render it potentially
useful for a detailed analysis of spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by
radiative corrections.
