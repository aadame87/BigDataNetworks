  We study three dimensional gauge theories with N=2 supersymmetry. We show
that the Coulomb branches of such theories may be rendered compact by the
dynamical generation of Chern-Simons terms and present a new class of mirror
symmetric theories in which both Coulomb and Higgs branches have a natural
description in terms of toric geometry.
