  We consider N = 2 super Yang-Mills theory with SU(2) gauge group and a single
quark hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation. For a specific value of
the quark bare mass and at a certain point in the moduli space of vacua, the
central charges corresponding to two mutually non-local electro-magnetic
charges vanish simultaneously, indicating the possibility of massless such
states in the spectrum. By realizing the theory as an M-theory configuration,
we show that these states indeed exist in the spectrum near the critical point.
