  The 3D vector van der Waals (or conformal) nonlinear sigma-model is proposed.
It is shown that it has the "hedgehog"-like topological excitations with
logarithmic energy. Their "neutral" configurations have nontrivial topological
structures described by Hopf invariant. A possible influence of these
excitations on the properties of the model are discussed.
