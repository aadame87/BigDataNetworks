  Gauged WZNW models are integrable conformal field theories. We integrate the
classical \slu{} theory with periodic boundary conditions, which describes
closed strings moving in a curved target-space geometry. We calculate its
Poisson bracket structure by solving an initial state problem. The results
differ from previous field-theoretic calculations due to zero modes. For a
future exact canonical quantization the physical fields are (non-locally)
transformed onto canonical free fields.
