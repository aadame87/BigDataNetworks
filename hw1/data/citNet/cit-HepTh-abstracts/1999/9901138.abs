  A new attempt is demonstrated that QFTs can be UV finite if they are viewed
as the low energy effective theories of a fundamental underlying theory
(complete and well-defined in all respects) according to the modern standard
point of view. This approach is much simpler in principle and in technology
comparing to any known renormalization program. Some subtle and difficult
issues can be easily resolved. The importance of the procedure for defining the
ambiguities is fully appreciated in the new approach. Some simple but important
nonperturbative examples are discussed to show the power and plausibility of
the new approach.
