  The quantum mechanics of a spin 1/2 particle on a locally spatial constant
curvature part of a (2+1)- spacetime in the presence of a constant magnetic
field of a magnetic monopole has been investigated. It has been shown that
these 2-dimensional Hamiltonians have the degeneracy group of SL(2,c), and
para-supersymmetry of arbitrary order or shape invariance. Using this symmetry
we have obtained its spectrum algebraically. The Dirac's quantization condition
has been obtained from the representation theory. Also, it is shown that the
presence of angular deficit suppresses both the degeneracy and shape
invariance.
