  Four-dimensional N-extended superconformal symmetry and correlation functions
of quasi-primary superfields are studied within the superspace formalism. A
superconformal Killing equation is derived and its solutions are classified in
terms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentz transformations, R-symmetry
transformations and special superconformal transformations. In general, due to
the invariance under supertranslations and special superconformal
transformations, superconformally invariant n-point functions reduce to one
unspecified (n-2)-point function which must transform homogeneously under the
remaining rigid transformations, i.e. dilations, Lorentz transformations and
R-symmetry transformations. Based on this result, we are able to identify all
the superconformal invariants and obtain the general form of n-point functions
for scalar superfields. In particular, as a byproduct, a selection rule for
correlation functions is derived, the existence of which in N=4 super
Yang-Mills theory was previously predicted in the context of AdS/CFT
correspondence. Superconformally covariant differential operators are also
discussed.
