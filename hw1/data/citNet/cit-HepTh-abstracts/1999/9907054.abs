  We review the construction of non-supersymmetric open string vacua in various
dimensions. They can be obtained either projecting the (compactified)
non-supersymmetric 0B theory, or applying the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism to open
strings. Generically, these vacua generate a non-vanishing cosmological
constant. However, one can construct particular kinds of Scherk-Schwarz
compactifications with vanishing cosmological constant, at least for low
orders, based on asymmetric orbifolds. A generic feature of these models is
that supersymmetry remains unbroken on the branes at all mass level, while it
is broken in the bulk in a way that preserves Fermi-Bose degeneracy at each
mass level in the perturbative string spectrum.
