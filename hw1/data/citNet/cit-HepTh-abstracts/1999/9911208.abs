  Two different scenarios (light-front and equal-time) are possible for
Yang-Mills theories in two dimensions. The exact $\bar q q$-potential can be
derived in perturbation theory starting from the light-front vacuum, but
requires essential instanton contributions in the equal-time formulation. In
higher dimensions no exact result is available and, paradoxically, only the
latter formulation (equal-time) is acceptable, at least in a perturbative
context.
