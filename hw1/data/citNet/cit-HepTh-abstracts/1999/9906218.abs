  Non-singular two and three dimensional string cosmologies are constructed
using the exact conformal field theories corresponding to SO(2,1)/SO(1,1) and
SO(2,2)/SO(2,1). All semi-classical curvature singularities are canceled in the
exact theories for both of these cosets, but some new quantum curvature
singularities emerge. However, considering different patches of the global
manifolds, allows the construction of non-singular spacetimes with cosmological
interpretation. In both two and three dimensions, we construct non-singular
oscillating cosmologies, non-singular expanding and inflationary cosmologies
including a de Sitter (exponential) stage with positive scalar curvature as
well as non-singular contracting and deflationary cosmologies. We analyse these
cosmologies in detail with respect to the behaviour of the scale factors, the
scalar curvature and the string-coupling. The sign of the scalar curvature is
changed by the quantum corrections in oscillating cosmologies and evolves with
time in the non-oscillating cases. Similarities between the two and three
dimensional cases suggest a general picture for higher dimensional coset
cosmologies: Anisotropy seems to be a generic unavoidable feature, cosmological
singularities are generically avoided and it is possible to construct
non-singular cosmologies where some spatial dimensions are experiencing
inflation while the others experience deflation.
