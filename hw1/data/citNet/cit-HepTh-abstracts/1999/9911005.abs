  It is shown that three-dimensional charged black holes can approach the
extreme state at nonzero temperature. Unlike even dimensional cases, the
entropy for the extreme three-dimensional charged black hole is uniquely
described by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, regardless of different treatments
of preparing the extreme black hole, namely, Hawking's treatment and
Zaslavskii's treatment.
