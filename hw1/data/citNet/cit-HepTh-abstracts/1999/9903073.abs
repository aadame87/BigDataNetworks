Title: The Bogoluibov Renormalization Group in Theoretical and Mathematical
  Physics
Author: D.V. Shirkov
Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX
\\
  This text follows the line of a talk on Ringberg symposium dedicated to
Wolfhart Zimmermann 70th birthday. The historical overview (Part 1) partially
overlaps with corresponding text of my previous commemorative paper. At the
same time second part includes some recent results in QFT and summarize an
impressive progress of the "QFT renormalization group" application in
mathematical physics.
