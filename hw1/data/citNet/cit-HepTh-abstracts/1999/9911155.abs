  We employ the Dirac-like equation for the gauge field proposed by Majorana to
obtain an action that is symmetric under duality transformation. We also use
the equivalence between duality and chiral symmetry in this fermion-like
formulation to show how the Maxwell action can be seen as a mass term.
