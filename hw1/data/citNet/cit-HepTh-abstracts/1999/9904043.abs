  By taking into account the effect of the would be Chern-Simons term, we
calculate the quantum correction to the Chern-Simons coefficient in
supersymmetric Chern-Simons Higgs theories with matter fields in the
fundamental representation of SU(n). Because of supersymmetry, the corrections
in the symmetric and Higgs phases are identical. In particular, the correction
is vanishing for N=3 supersymmetric Chern-Simons Higgs theories. The result
should be quite general, and have important implication for the more
interesting case when the Higgs is in the adjoint representation.
