  We analyse symmetry breaking in the Weinberg-Salam model paying particular
attention to the underlying geometry of the theory. In this context we find two
natural metrics upon the vacuum manifold: an isotropic metric associated with
the scalar sector, and a squashed metric associated with the gauge sector.
Physically, the interplay between these metrics gives rise to many of the
non-perturbative features of Weinberg-Salam theory.
