  We calculate the linearized metric perturbation corresponding to a massless
four-dimensional scalar field, the radion, in a five-dimensional two-brane
model of Randall and Sundrum. In this way we obtain relative strengths of the
radion couplings to matter residing on each of the branes. The results are in
agreement with the analysis of Garriga and Tanaka of gravitational and
Brans--Dicke forces between matter on the branes. We also introduce a model
with infinite fifth dimension and ``almost'' confined graviton, and calculate
the radion properties in that model.
