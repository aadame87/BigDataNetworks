  We perform a two-loop calculation in light-front phi^4 theory to determine
the effective mass renormalization of the light-front Hamiltonian. The
renormalization scheme adopted here is manifestly boost invariant, and yields
results that are in perfect agreement with the explicitly covariant Feynman
diagram approach.
