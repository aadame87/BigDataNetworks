  We argue that the familiar gauge hierarchy between the fundamental Planck
scale M_{Pl} and the electroweak scale M_{W}, can be naturally explained in
higher dimensional theories with relatively large radii (R_c > 1/M_{Pl}) extra
dimensions. In particular, we show that it is possible that the electroweak
Higgs mass at high energies is of the order of M_{Pl}, but radiative
corrections drive it to an infrared stable fixed-point $\sim M_{W}$ at low
energies thus inducing a large hierarchy without any fine tuning of parameters.
