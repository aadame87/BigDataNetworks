  We show how to calculate the quantum mass correction to (1+1)D solitonic
field theories using numerical methods. This is essential if we want to find
the corrections to non-integrable models. We start with a review of the
standard derivation of the first order quantum correction. Then, we re-derive a
trace formula which allows us to compute the mass correction mode by mode.
Specifically, we are interested in the extent to which the lowest modes from
both, the soliton and the vacuum, sectors give the leading contribution. We
apply the technique to both the Sine-Gordon and the $\phi^4$-kink model. Then,
we compute all the modes numerically and hence the first order quantum
contribution to the mass of the Sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ soliton.
