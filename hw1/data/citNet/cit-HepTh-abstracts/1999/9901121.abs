  We compute the 3-point function of the stress-energy tensor in the
d-dimensional CFT from the AdS_{d+1} gravity. For d=4 the coefficients of the
three linearly independent conformally covariant forms entering the 3-point
function are exactly the same as given by the free field computations in the
${\cal N}=4$ SYM just as expected from the known renormalization theorems. For
d=3 and d=6 our results give the value of the corresponding 3-point function in
the theories of strongly coupled ${\cal N}=8$ superconformal scalar and (2,0)
tensor multiplets respectively.
