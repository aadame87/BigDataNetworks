  We consider the constraints on the effective Lagrangian of the rank-one gauge
field on D-branes imposed by the equivalence between the description by
ordinary gauge theory and that by non-commutative gauge theory in the presence
of a constant B field. It is shown that we can consistently construct the
two-derivative corrections to the Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangian up to the
quartic order of field strength and the most general form which satisfies the
constraints up to this order is derived.
