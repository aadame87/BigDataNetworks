  We derive a new version of SU(3) non-Abelian Stokes theorem by making use of
the coherent state representation on the coset space $SU(3)/(U(1)\times
U(1))=F_2$, the flag space. Then we outline a derivation of the area law of the
Wilson loop in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge (The
detailed exposition will be given in a forthcoming article). This derivation is
performed by combining the non-Abelian Stokes theorem with the reformulation of
the Yang-Mills theory as a perturbative deformation of a topological field
theory recently proposed by one of the authors. Within this framework, we show
that the fundamental quark is confined even if $G=SU(3)$ is broken by partial
gauge fixing into $H=U(2)$ just as $G$ is broken to $H=U(1) \times U(1)$. An
origin of the area law is related to the geometric phase of the Wilczek-Zee
holonomy for U(2). Abelian dominance is an immediate byproduct of these results
and magnetic monopole plays the dominant role in this derivation.
