  Conventional non-Abelian SO(4) gauge theory is able to describe gravity
provided the gauge field possesses a specific polarized vacuum state in which
the instantons have a preferred orientation. Their orientation plays the role
of the order parameter for the polarized phase of the gauge field. The
interaction of a weak and smooth gauge field with the polarized vacuum is
described by an effective long-range action which is identical to the Hilbert
action of general relativity. In the classical limit this action results in the
Einstein equations of general relativity. Gravitons appear as the mode
describing propagation of the gauge field which strongly interacts with the
oriented instantons. The Newton gravitational constant describes the density of
the considered phase of the gauge field. The radius of the instantons under
consideration is comparable with the Planck radius.
