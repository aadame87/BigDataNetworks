  We consider non perturbative effects in M-theory compactifications on a
seven-manifold of G_2 holonomy arising from membranes wrapped on supersymmetric
three-cycles. When membranes are wrapped on associative submanifolds they
induce a superpotential that can be calculated using calibrated geometry. This
superpotential is also derived from compactification on a seven-manifold, to
four dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime, of eleven dimensional supergravity
with non vanishing expectation value of the four-form field strength.
