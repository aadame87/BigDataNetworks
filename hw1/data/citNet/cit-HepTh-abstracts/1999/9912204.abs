  We study a certain class of four-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric orientifolds
for which the world-sheet parity transformation is combined with a complex
conjugation in the compact directions. We investigate in detail the
orientifolds of the Z_3, Z_4, Z_6 and Z_6' toroidal orbifolds finding solutions
to the tadpole cancellation conditions for all models. Generically, all the
massless spectra turn out to be non-chiral.
