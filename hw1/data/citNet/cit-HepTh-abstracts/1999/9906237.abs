  We compare oscillations of a fundamental string ending on a D3-brane in two
different settings: (1) a test-string radially threading the horizon of an
extremal black D3-brane and (2) the spike soliton of the DBI effective action
for a D3-brane. Previous work has shown that overall transverse modes of the
test-string appear as l=0 modes of the transverse scalar fields of the DBI
system. We identify DBI world-volume degrees of freedom that have dynamics
matching those of the test-string relative transverse modes. We show that there
is a map, resembling T-duality, between relative and overall transverse modes
for the test-string that interchanges Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions
and implies equality of the absorption coefficients for both modes. We give
general solutions to the overall and relative transverse parts of the DBI
coupled gauge and scalar system and calculate absorption coefficients for the
higher angular momentum modes in the low frequency limit. We find that there is
a nonzero amplitude for l>0 modes to travel out to infinity along the spike,
demonstrating that the spike remains effectively 3+1-dimensional.
