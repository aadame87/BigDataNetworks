  We re-examine the problem of determining the possible D-branes in the
Nappi-Witten background. In addition to the known branes, we find that there
are also D-instantons, flat euclidean D-strings and curved D-membranes
admitting parallel spinors, all of which can be interpreted as (twisted)
conjugacy classes in the Nappi-Witten group.
