  The renormalization group (RG) method as a powerful tool for reduction of
evolution equations is formulated in terms of the notion of invariant
manifolds. We start with derivation of an exact RG equation which is analogous
to the Wilsonian RG equations in statistical physics and quantum field theory.
It is clarified that the perturbative RG method constructs invariant manifolds
successively as the initial value of evolution equations, thereby the meaning
to set $t_0=t$ is naturally understood where $t_0$ is the arbitrary initial
time. We show that the integral constants in the unperturbative solution
constitutes natural coordinates of the invariant manifold when the linear
operator $A$ in the evolution equation has no Jordan cell; when $A$ has a
Jordan cell, a slight modification is necessary because the dimension of the
invariant manifold is increased by the perturbation. The RG equation determines
the slow motion of the would-be integral constants in the unperturbative
solution on the invariant manifold. We present the mechanical procedure to
construct the perturbative solutions hence the initial values with which the RG
equation gives meaningful results. The underlying structure of the reduction by
the RG method as formulated in the present work turns out to completely fit to
the universal one elucidated by Kuramoto some years ago. We indicate that the
reduction procedure of evolution equations has a good correspondence with the
renormalization procedure in quantum field theory; the counter part of the
universal structure of reduction elucidated by Kuramoto may be the Polchinski's
theorem for renormalizable field theories. We apply the method to interface
dynamics such as kink-anti-kink and soliton-soliton interactions in the latter
of which a linear operator having a Jordan-cell structure appears.
