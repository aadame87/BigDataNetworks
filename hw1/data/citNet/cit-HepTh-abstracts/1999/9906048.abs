  We discuss the dynamics and thermodynamics of particle and D-brane probes
moving in non-extremal black hole/brane backgrounds. When a probe falls from
asymptotic infinity to the horizon, it transforms its potential energy into
heat, $TdS$, which is absorbed by the black hole in a way consistent with the
first law of thermodynamics. We show that the same remains true in the
near-horizon limit, for BPS probes only, with the BPS probe moving from AdS
infinity to the horizon. This is a quantitative indication that the brane-probe
reaching the horizon corresponds to thermalization in gauge theory. It is shown
that this relation provides a way to reliably compute the entropy away from the
extremal limit (towards the Schwarzschild limit).
