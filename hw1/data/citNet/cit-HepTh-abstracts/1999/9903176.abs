  In this paper we further elaborate on the notion of fractional exclusion
statistics, as introduced by Haldane, in two-dimensional conformal field
theory, and its connection to the Universal Chiral Partition Function as
defined by McCoy and collaborators. We will argue that in general, besides the
pseudo-particles introduced recently by Guruswamy and Schoutens, one needs
additional `null quasi-particles' to account for the null-states in the
quasi-particle Fock space. We illustrate this in several examples of
WZW-models.
