  We study the behaviour of Wilson and 't Hooft loop operators for the 2+1 dim.
Abelian-Higgs model with Chern-Simons term. The phase of topological symmetry
breaking where the vortex field condenses, found by Samuel for the model in the
absence of the Chern-Simons term, persists in its presence. In this phase, the
topological linking of instantons, which are configurations of closed vortex
loops, with the Wilson loop on one hand and with the 't Hooft loop on the other
hand gives rise to a long-range, logarithmic, confining potential between
electric charges and magnetic flux tubes. This is surprising since the gauge
field is short range due to the Chern-Simons term. Gauss' law forces the
concomitance of charge and magnetic flux, hence the confinement is actually of
anyons.
