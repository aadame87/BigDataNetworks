Title: Some Speculations on the Gauge Coupling in the AdS/CFT Approach

  We propose the principle that the scale of the glueball masses in the AdS/CFT
approach to QCD should be set by the square root of the string tension. It then
turns out that the strong bare coupling runs logarithmically with the
ultraviolet cutoff T if first order world sheet fluctuations are included. We
also point out that in the end, when all corrections are included, one should
obtain an equation for the coupling running with T which has some similarity
with the equation for the strong bare coupling.
