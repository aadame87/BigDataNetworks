  We construct new configurations of oppositely charged, static black hole
pairs (diholes) in four dimensions which are solutions of low energy
string/M-theory. The black holes are extremal and have four different charges.
We also consider diholes in other theories with an arbitrary number of abelian
gauge fields and scalars, where the black holes can be regarded as composite
objects. We uplift the four-charge solutions to higher dimensions in order to
describe intersecting brane-antibrane systems in string and M-theory. The
properties of the strings and membranes stretched inbetween these branes and
antibranes are studied. Several other generic features of these solutions are
discussed.
