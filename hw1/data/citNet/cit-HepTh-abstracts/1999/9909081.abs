  We discuss the physics of a single Dp-brane in the presence of a background
electromagnetic field B_{ij}. It has recently been shown \cite{SW} that, in a
specific \alpha ' \to 0 limit, the physics of the brane is correctly described
by noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, where the noncommutative gauge potential
is given explicitly in terms of the ordinary U(1) field. In a previous paper
\cite{SC} the physics of a D2-brane was analyzed in the Sen-Seiberg limit of
M(atrix) theory by considering a specific coordinate change on the brane
world-volume. We show in this note that the limit considered in \cite{SC} is
the same as the one described in \cite{SW}, in the specific case p=2, rk B_{ij}
= 2. Moreover we show that the coordinate change in \cite{SC} can be
reinterpreted, in the spirit of \cite{SW}, as a field redefinition of the
ordinary Yang-Mills field, and we prove that the transformations agree for
large backgrounds. The results are finally used to considerably streamline the
proof of the equivalence of the standard Born-Infeld action with noncommutative
Yang-Mills theory, in the large wave-length regime.
