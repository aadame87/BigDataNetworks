  The classical cross section for low energy absorption of the RR-scalar by a
stack of noncommutative D3-branes in the large NS B-field limit is calculated.
In the spirit of AdS/CFT correspondence, this cross section is related to two
point function of a certain operator in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory.
Compared at the same gauge coupling, the result agrees with that of obtained
from ordinary D3-branes. This is consistent with the expectation that ordinary
and noncommutative Yang-Mills theories are equivalent below the
noncommutativity scale, but it is a nontrivial prediction above this scale.
