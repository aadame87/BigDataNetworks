  We discuss various dualities, relating integrable systems and show that these
dualities are explained in the framework of Hamiltonian and Poisson reductions.
The dualities we study shed some light on the known integrable systems as well
as allow to construct new ones, double elliptic among them. We also discuss
applications to the (supersymmetric) gauge theories in various dimensions.
