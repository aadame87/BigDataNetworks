  Six dimensional supergravities on $ADS_3 \times S^3$ present interest due to
the role they play in the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence. The correspondence in this
case states the equivalence between supergravity on the given background and a
still unknown conformal field theory. The conformal field theory in question is
expected to appear by deforming of the free conformal field theory on
$S^N(T^4)$ in a way which preserves the superconformal symmetry. The purpose of
this paper is to compute the first nontrivial corrections to the equations of
motion for the chiral primary fields coming from supergravity. Using the
methods already developed which involve nontrivial redefinitions of fields, we
compute three-point correlation functions for scalar chiral primaries and
notice similarities between their expressions and those obtained in the
orbifold conformal field theory.
