  We describe a scheme for constructing the holographic dual of the full
D3-brane geometry with charge $K$ by embedding it into a large anti-de Sitter
space of size $N$. Such a geometry is realized in a multi-center anti-de Sitter
geometry which admits a simple field theory interpretation as $SU(N+K)$ gauge
theory broken to $SU(N) \times SU(K)$. We find that the characteristic size of
the D3-brane geometry is of order $(K/N)^{1/4} U^0$ where $U^0$ is the scale of
the Higgs. By choosing $N$ to be much larger than $K$, the scale of the
D3-brane metric can be well separated from the Higgs scale in the radial
coordinate. We generalize the holographic energy-distance relation and estimate
the characteristic energy scale associated with these radial scales, and find
that the $E/U$ relation becomes effectively $U$ independent in the range
$(K/N)^{1/2} U^0 < U < U^0$. This implies that all detailed structure of the
D3-brane geometry is encoded in the fine structure of the boundary gauge theory
at around the Higgs scale.
