  The anomalies of a very general class of non local Dirac operators are
computed using the $\zeta$-function definition of the fermionic determinant and
an asymmetric version of the Wigner transformation. For the axial anomaly all
new terms introduced by the non locality can be brought to the standard minimal
Bardeen's form. Some extensions of the present techniques are also commented.
