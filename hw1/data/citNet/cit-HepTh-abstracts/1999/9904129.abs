  In the previous paper [hep-th/9904112], we argued that there exist BPS bound
states of Dp branes carrying certain units of quantized constant electric field
for every $p$ (with $1 \le p \le 8$). Each of these bound states preserves one
half of the spacetime supersymmetries. In this paper, we construct these bound
state configurations explicitly for $2 \le p \le 7$ from Schwarz's
$(m,n)$-string or (F, D1) bound state in type IIB string theory by T-dualities
along the transverse directions. We calculate the charge per $(2\pi)^{p -1}
\alpha'^{(p - 1)/2}$ of $(p -1)$-dimensional area for F-strings in (F, Dp) and
the tension for each of these bound states. The results agree precisely with
those obtained previously from the worldvolume study. We study the decoupling
limit for the (F, D3) bound state and find that Maldacena's $AdS_5/CFT_4$
correspondence may hold true even with respect to thisbound state but now with
an effective string coupling rather than the usual string coupling. This
coupling is quantized and can be independent of the usual string coupling in
certain limit.
