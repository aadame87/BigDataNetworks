  The BPS method is used to find BPS solutions of the worldvolume theory of a
D5-brane in the near horizon geometry of a D3-brane. The BPS bound is
interpreted in terms of the `maximally extended' D5 worldvolume supersymmetry
algebra in the corresponding curved background, which is OSp(1|16). This
algebra is an extension of the worldvolume superalgebra OSp(4^*|4). The
analysis is generalized to the non-near horizon case.
