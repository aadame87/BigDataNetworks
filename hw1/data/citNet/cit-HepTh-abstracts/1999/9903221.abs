  We make use of product integrals to provide an unambiguous mathematical
representation of Wilson line and Wilson loop operators. Then, drawing upon
various properties of product integrals, we discuss such properties of these
operators as approximating them with partial sums, their convergence, and their
behavior under gauge transformations. We also obtain a surface product integral
representation for the Wilson loop operator. The result can be interpreted as
the non-abelian version of Stokes theorem.
