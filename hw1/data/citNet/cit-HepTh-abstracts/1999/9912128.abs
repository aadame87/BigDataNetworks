  Quantum gravity coupled to scalar massive matter fields is investigated
within the framework of causal perturbation theory. One-loop calculations
include matter loop graviton self-energy and matter self-energy and yield
ultraviolet finite and cutoff-free expressions. Perturbative gauge invariance
to second order implies the usual Slavnov-Ward identities for the graviton
self-energy in the loop graph sector and generates the correct quartic
graviton-matter interaction in the tree graph sector. The mass zero case is
also discussed.
