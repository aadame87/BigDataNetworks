Title: Concavity of the $Q\bar Q$ potential in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
  gauge theory and AdS/CFT duality
Authors: H. Dorn, V.D. Pershin
Comments: Improved derivation of the basic inequalities including separation in
  rigorous and conjectured statements. No change concerning potentials derived
  via AdS/CFT

  We derive a generalised concavity condition for potentials between static
sources obtained from Wilson loops coupling both to gauge bosons and a set of
scalar fields. It involves the second derivatives with respect to the distance
in ordinary space as well as with respect to the relative orientation in
internal space. In addition we discuss the use of this field theoretical
condition as a nontrivial consistency check of the AdS/CFT duality.
