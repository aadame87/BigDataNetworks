  We extend our recent discussion of four-dimensional black holes bound to a
two-brane to include a negative cosmological constant on the brane. We find
that for large masses, the solutions are precisely BTZ black holes on the
brane, and BTZ `black strings' in the bulk. For smaller masses, there are
localized black holes which look like BTZ with corrections that fall off
exponentially. We compute when the maximum entropy configuration changes from
the black string to the black hole. We also present exact solutions describing
rotating black holes on two-branes which are either asymptotically flat or
asymptotically $AdS_3$. The mass and angular momentum on the brane agree with
that in the bulk.
