Title: Some Generalized BRS Transformations. II A Quantum Gravity Model
Authors: Paul Federbush (Univ. of Michigan)
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX
\\
  Generalized BRS transformations such as introduced in Part I (hep-th/9906245)
are applied to a model of quantum gravity. This development is technically
complex; but at the least should illustrate how much less rigid and more
general of application are the new BRS transformations.
