  The QED renormalization is restudied by using a mass-dependent subtraction
which is performed at a time-like renormalization point. The subtraction
exactly respects necessary physical and mathematical requirements such as the
gauge symmetry, the Lorentz- invariance and the mathematical convergence.
Therefore, the renormalized results derived in the subtraction scheme are
faithful and have no ambiguity. Especially, it is proved that the solution of
the renormalization group equation satisfied by a renormalized wave function,
propagator or vertex can be fixed by applying the renormalization boundary
condition and of the form as given in the Feynman rules and, thus, an exact
S-matrix element can be expressed in the form as written in the tree diagram
approximation provided that the coupling constant and the fermion mass are
replaced by their effective ones. In the one-loop approximation, the effective
coupling constant and the effective fermion mass obtained by solving their
renormalization group equations are given in rigorous and explicit expressions
which are suitable in the whole range of distance. and exhibit physically
reasonable asymptotic behaviors.
