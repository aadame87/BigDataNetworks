  In this letter we show that the ``preferred'' Klein-Gordon Quantum Field
Theories (QFT's) on a d-dimensional de Sitter spacetime can be obtained from a
Klein-Gordon QFT on a (d+1)-dimensional ``ambient'' Minkowski spacetime
satisfying the spectral condition and, conversely, that a Klein-Gordon QFT on a
(d+1)-dimensional ``ambient'' Minkowski spacetime satisfying the spectral
condition can be obtained as superposition of d-dimensional de Sitter
Klein-Gordon fields in the preferred vacuum. These results establish a
correspondence between QFT's living on manifolds having different dimensions.
The method exposed here can be applied to study other situations and notably
QFT on Anti de Sitter spacetime.
