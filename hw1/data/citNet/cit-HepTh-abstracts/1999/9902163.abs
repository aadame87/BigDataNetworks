Title: Exact effective action for N=1 supersymmetric theories
Authors: P.Pronin and K.Stepanyantz
Comments: 22 pages, LATEX, 1 eps figure
\\
  We investigate nonperturbative effects in N=1 supersymmetric theories and
propose a new expression for the effective action, which correctly reproduces
quantum anomalies and agrees with the transformation law of instanton measure.
Actually the result is a nonperturbative extension of Veneziano-Yankielowitch
effective Lagrangian. The possibility of integrating out the gluino condensate
is discussed.
