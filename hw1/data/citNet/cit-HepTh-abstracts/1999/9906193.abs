  Linear recursion relations for the instanton corrections to the effective
prepotential of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with an arbitrary number of
hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of an arbitrary classical
gauge group are dervied. The construction proceeds from the Seiberg-Witten
solutions and the renormalization group type equations for the prepotential.
Successive iterations of these recursion relations allow us to simple obtain
instanton corrections to arbitrarily high order, which we exhibit explicitly up
to 6-th order. For gauge groups SU(2) and SU(3), our results agree with
previous ones.
