Title: Non-highest weight representations of the current algebra
  $\hat{so}(1,n)$, and Laplace Operators
Authors: M. Zyskin
Comments: Replaced by revised version
\\
  We constructed canonical non-highest weight unitary irreducible
representation of $\hat{so}(1,n)$ current algebra as well as canonical
non-highest weight non-unitary representations, We constructed certain
Laplacian operators as elements of the universal enveloping algebra, acting in
representation space. We speculated about a possible relation of those
Laplacians with the loop operator for the Yang-Mills.
