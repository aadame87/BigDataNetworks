Title: M-theory and Deformation Quantization
Author: D. Minic (USC)

  We discuss deformation quantization of the covariant, light-cone and
conformal gauge-fixed p-brane actions (p>1) which are closely related to the
structure of the classical and quantum Nambu brackets. It is known that
deformation quantization of the Nambu bracket is not of the usual Moyal type.
Yet the Nambu bracket can be quantized using the Zariski deformation
quantization (discovered by Dito, Flato, Sternheimer and Takhtajan) which is
based on factorization of polynomials in several real variables. We discuss a
particular application of the Zariski deformed quantization in M-theory by
considering the problem of a covariant formulation of Matrix theory. We propose
that the problem of a covariant formulation of Matrix theory can be solved
using the formalism of Zariski deformed quantization of the triple Nambu
bracket.
