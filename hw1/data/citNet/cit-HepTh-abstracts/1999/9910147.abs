  The on-shell regularization of the one-loop divergences of supergravity
theories is generalized to include a dilaton of the type occurring in effective
field theories derived from superstring theory, and the superfield structure of
the one-loop corrections is given. Field theory anomalies and quantum
contributions to soft supersymmetry breaking are discussed. The latter are
sensitive to the precise choice of couplings that generate Pauli-Villars
masses, which in turn reflect the details of the underlying theory above the
scale of the effective cut-off. With a view to the implementation the
Green-Schwarz and other mechanisms for canceling field theory anomalies under a
U(1) gauge transformation and under the T-duality group of modular
transformations, we show that the K\"ahler potential renormalization for the
untwisted sector of orbifold compactification can be made invariant under these
groups.
