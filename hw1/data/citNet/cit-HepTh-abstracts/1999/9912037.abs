  We investigate a string/M theoretic realization of the varying speed of light
scenario. We consider a 3+1 dimensional probe-brane universe in the background
of a black hole in the bulk formed by a stack of branes, in the spirit of
Kiritsis (hep-th/9906206). We generalize the dynamics of the system at hand by
including rotation and Hubble damping of the bulk space-time and show that this
may lead to a mechanism to stabilize the brane-universe and hence fix the speed
of light at late times.
