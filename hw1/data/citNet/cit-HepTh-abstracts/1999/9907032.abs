  A generalized second law in string cosmology accounts for geometric and
quantum entropy in addition to ordinary sources of entropy. The proposed
generalized second law forbids singular string cosmologies, under certain
conditions, and forces a graceful exit transition from dilaton-driven inflation
by bounding curvature and dilaton kinetic energy.
