  We propose a method to investigate the conservation of brane charges at the
intersection of two or more branes using the Thom classes of their normal
bundles. In particular we find a relation between the charge of the branes
involved in the configuration and the charge of the defects on the branes due
to the intersection. We also explore the applications of our method for various
brane intersections in type II strings and M-theory.
