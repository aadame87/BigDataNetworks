  Recent progress in understanding (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills (YM_{2+1})
theory via the use of gauge-invariant variables is reviewed. Among other
things, we discuss the vacuum wavefunction, an analytic calculation of the
string tension and the propagator mass for gluons and its relation to the
magnetic mass for YM_{3+1} at nonzero temperature.
