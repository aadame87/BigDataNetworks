  Let us consider a Lie (super)algebra $G$ spanned by $T_{\alpha}$ where
$T_{\alpha}$ are quantum observables in BV-formalism. It is proved that for
every tensor $c^{\alpha_1...\alpha_k}$ that determines a homology class of the
Lie algebra $G$ the expression $c^{\alpha_1...\alpha_k}T_{\alpha
_1}...T_{\alpha_k}$ is again a quantum observables. This theorem is used to
construct quantum observables in BV sigma-model. We apply this construction to
explain Kontsevich's results about the relation between homology of the Lie
algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields and topological invariants of manifolds.
