  We study $N$ coincident IIA NS5-branes at large $N$ using supergravity. We
show that the absorption cross section for gravitons in this background does
not vanish at zero string coupling for energies larger than $m_s/\sqrt{N}$
($m_s$ is the string scale). Using a holographic description of the intrinsic
theory of the IIA NS5-branes, we find an expression for the two point function
of the stress energy tensor, and comment on its structure.
