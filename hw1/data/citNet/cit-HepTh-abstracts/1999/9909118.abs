  We consider a two-dimensional integrable and conformally invariant field
theory possessing two Dirac spinors and three scalar fields. The interaction
couples bilinear terms in the spinors to exponentials of the scalars. Its
integrability properties are based on the sl(2) affine Kac-Moody algebra, and
it is a simple example of the so-called conformal affine Toda theories coupled
to matter fields. We show, using bosonization techniques, that the classical
equivalence between a U(1) Noether current and the topological current holds
true at the quantum level, and then leads to a bag model like mechanism for the
confinement of the spinor fields inside the solitons. By bosonizing the spinors
we show that the theory decouples into a sine-Gordon model and free scalars. We
construct the two-soliton solutions and show that their interactions lead to
the same time delays as those for the sine-Gordon solitons. The model provides
a good laboratory to test duality ideas in the context of the equivalence
between the sine-Gordon and Thirring theories.
