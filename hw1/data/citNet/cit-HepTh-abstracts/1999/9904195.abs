  The well-known $D$-dimensional Feynman integrals were shown, by Halliday and
Ricotta, to be capable of undergoing analytic continuation into the domain of
negative values for the dimension of space-time. Furthermore, this could be
identified with Grassmannian integration in positive dimensions. From this
possibility follows the concept of negative dimensional integration for loop
integrals in field theories. Using this technique, we evaluate three two-loop
three-point scalar integrals, with five and six massless propagators, with
specific external kinematic configurations (two legs on-shell), and four
three-loop two-point scalar integrals. These results are given for arbitrary
exponents of propagators and dimension, in Euclidean space, and the particular
cases compared to results published in the literature.
