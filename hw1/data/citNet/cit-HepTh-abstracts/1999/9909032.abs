  We find the Seiberg-Witten geometry for four dimensional N=2 supersymmetric
E_6 gauge theories with massless fundamental hypermultiplets, by geometrically
embedding them in type II string theories compactified on Calabi-Yau
threefolds. The resulting geometry completely agrees with that of recent works,
which are based on the technique of N=1 confining phase superpotentials. We
also derive the Seiberg-Witten geometry for E_7 gauge theories with massive
fundamental hypermultiplets.
