Title: On the Holographic S-matrix

\\
  The recent proposal by Polchinski and Susskind for the holographic flat space
S-matrix is discussed. By using Feynman diagrams we argue that in principle all
the information about the S-matrix in the interacting field theory in the bulk
of the anti-de Sitter space is encoded into the data on the timelike boundary.
The problem of locality of interpolating field is discussed and it is suggested
that the interpolating field lives in a quantum Boltzmannian Hilbert space.
