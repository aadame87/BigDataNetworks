  We discuss the field theory limit of Dp-branes. In this limit, the black
Dp-brane solution approaches a solution which is conformal to adS_{p+2} \times
S^{8-p}. We argue that the frame in which the conformal factor is equal to one,
the dual frame, is a `holographic' frame. The radial coordinate of adS_{p+2}
provides a UV/IR connection as in the case of the D3 brane. The gravitational
description involves gauged supergravities, typically with non-compact gauge
groups. The near-horizon Dp-brane solution becomes a domain-wall solution of
the latter.
