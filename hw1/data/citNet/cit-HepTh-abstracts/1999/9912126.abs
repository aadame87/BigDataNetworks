  The spin of a glueball is usually taken as coming from the spin (and possibly
the orbital angular momentum) of its constituent gluons. In light of the
difficulties in accounting for the spin of the proton from its constituent
quarks, the spin of glueballs is reexamined. The starting point is the
fundamental QCD field angular momentum operator written in terms of the
chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields. First, we look at the restrictions
placed on the structure of glueballs from the requirement that the QCD field
angular momentum operator should satisfy the standard commutation
relationships. This can be compared to the electromagnetic charge/monopole
system, where the quantization of the field angular momentum places
restrictions (i.e. the Dirac condition) on the system. Second, we look at the
expectation value of this operator under some simplifying assumptions.
