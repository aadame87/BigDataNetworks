  We examine how to construct explicit heterotic string models dual to F-theory
in eight dimensions. In doing so we learn about where the moduli spaces of the
two theories overlap, and how non-perturbative features leave traces on a
purely perturbative level. We also propose a modified T-duality linking M and
F-theories based on non-perturbative structures of string theories in eight
dimensions.
