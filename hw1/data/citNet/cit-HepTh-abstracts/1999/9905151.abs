  The general static solutions of the scalar field equation for the potential
$V(\phi)= -1/2 M^2\phi^2 + \lambda/4 \phi^4$ are determined for a finite domain
in $(1+1)$ dimensional space-time. A family of real solutions is described in
terms of Jacobi Elliptic Functions. We show that the vacuum-vacuum boundary
conditions can be reached by elliptic cn-type solutions in a finite domain,
such as of the Kink, for which they are imposed at infinity. We proved
uniqueness for elliptic sn-type solutions satisfying Dirichlet boundary
conditions in a finite interval (box) as well the existence of a minimal mass
corresponding to these solutions in a box. We define expressions for the
``topological charge'', ``total energy'' (or classical mass) and ``energy
density'' for elliptic sn-type solutions in a finite domain. For large length
of the box the conserved charge, classical mass and energy density of the Kink
are recovered. Also, we have shown that using periodic boundary conditions the
results are the same as in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the
case of anti-periodic boundary conditions all elliptic sn-type solutions are
allowed.
