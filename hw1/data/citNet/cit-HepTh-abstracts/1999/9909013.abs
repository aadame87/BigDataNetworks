  There is substantial evidence that string theory on AdS_5 x S_5 is a
holographic theory in which the number of degrees of freedom scales as the area
of the boundary in Planck units. Precisely how the theory can describe bulk
physics using only surface degrees of freedom is not well understood. A
particularly paradoxical situation involves an event deep in the interior of
the bulk space. The event must be recorded in the (Schroedinger Picture) state
vector of the boundary theory long before a signal, such as a gravitational
wave, can propagate from the event to the boundary. In a previous paper with
Polchinski, we argued that the "precursor" operators which carry information
stored in the wave during the time when it vanishes in a neighborhood of the
boundary are necessarily non-local. In this paper we argue that the precursors
cannot be products of local gauge invariant operators such as the energy
momentum tensor. In fact gauge theories have a class of intrinsically non-local
operators which cannot be built from local gauge invariant objects. These are
the Wilson loops. We show that the precursors can be identified with Wilson
loops whose spatial size is dictated by the UV-IR connection.
