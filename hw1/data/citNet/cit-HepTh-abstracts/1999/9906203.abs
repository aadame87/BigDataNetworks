\\
  Supergravity solution describing two intersecting M5-branes is presented. The
branes are fixed in the relative transverse directions and are delocalized
along the overall transverse ones. The intersection can be smoothed, so that
the M5-branes present one holomorphic cycle. We also obtain a solution
corresponding to an M5-brane on a holomorphic cycle of multi-Taub-NUT space.
All these solutions preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry.
