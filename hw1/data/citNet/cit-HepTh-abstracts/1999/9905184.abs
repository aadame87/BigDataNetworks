  We investigate a model for a real scalar field in bidimensional space-time,
described in terms of a positive semi-definite potential that presents no
vacuum state. The system presents topological solutions of the BPS type, with
energy density that follows a Lorentzian law. These BPS solutions differ from
the standard $\tanh$-type kink, but they also support bosonic and fermionic
zero modes.
