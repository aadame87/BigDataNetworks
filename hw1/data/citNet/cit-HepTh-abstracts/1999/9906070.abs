  We consider F/M/Type IIA theory compactified to four, three, or two
dimensions on a Calabi-Yau four-fold, and study the behavior near an isolated
singularity in the presence of appropriate fluxes and branes. We analyze the
vacuum and soliton structure of these models, and show that near an isolated
singularity, one often generates massless chiral superfields and a
superpotential, and in many instances in two or three dimensions one obtains
nontrivial superconformal field theories. In the case of two dimensions, we
identify some of these theories with certain Kazama-Suzuki coset models, such
as the N=2 minimal models.
