  We show that the De Donder-Weyl (DW) covariant Hamiltonian field equations of
any field can be written in Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) matrix form. As a
consequence, the (modified) DKP beta-matrices (5 X 5 in four space-time
dimensions) are of universal significance for all fields admitting the DW
Hamiltonian formulation, not only for a scalar field, and can be viewed as
field theoretic analogues of the symplectic matrix, leading to the so-called
``k-symplectic'' (k=4) structure. We also briefly discuss what could be viewed
as the covariant Poisson bracket given by beta-matrices and the corresponding
Poisson bracket formulation of DW Hamiltonian field equations.
