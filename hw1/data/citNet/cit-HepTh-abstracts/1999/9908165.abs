  In the first part of this talk I discuss two somewhat different supergravity
approaches to calculating correlation functions in strongly coupled Yang-Mills
theory. The older approach relates two-point functions to cross-sections for
absorption of certain incident quanta by threebranes. In this approach the
normalization of operators corresponding to the incident particles is fixed
unambiguously by the D3-brane DBI action. By calculating absorption
cross-sections of all partial waves of the dilaton we find corresponding
two-point functions at strong `t Hooft coupling and show that they are
identical to the weak coupling results. The newer approach to correlation
functions relates them to boundary conditions in AdS space. Using this method
we show that for a certain range of negative mass-squared there are two
possible operator dimensions corresponding to a given scalar field in AdS, and
indicate how to calculate correlation functions for either of these choices. In
the second part of the talk I discuss an example of AdS/CFT duality which
arises in the context of type 0 string theory. The CFT on N coincident electric
and magnetic D3-branes is argued to be stable for sufficiently weak `t Hooft
coupling. It is suggested that its transition to instability at a critical
coupling is related to singularity of planar diagrams.
