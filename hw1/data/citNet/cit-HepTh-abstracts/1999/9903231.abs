  The Kaluza-Klein spectrum of D=5 simple supergravity compactified on S^3 is
studied. A classical background solution which preserves maximal supersymmetry
is fulfilled by the geometry of AdS_2\times S^3. The physical spectrum of the
fluctuations is classified according to SU(1,1|2)\times SU(2) symmetry, which
has a very similar structure to that in the case of compactification on
AdS_3\times S^2.
