  This is one of the `New Talents' seminars at `Erice International School of
Subnuclear Physics 1999' and looks at numerical studies of (2+1)D topological
Skyrme-like solitons; the baby skyrmions. We explain the concept of integrable
and topological solitons. Then we introduce the non-linear sigma model in 2D in
order to discuss the 3D nuclear Skyrme model. We explain that the baby Skyrme
models can be viewed as a (2+1)D version of the Skyrme model. We describe the
numerical methods needed to study the baby skyrmions. Finally, we present some
results on skyrmion-skyrmion scattering and our work on skyrmions with higher
topological charge.
