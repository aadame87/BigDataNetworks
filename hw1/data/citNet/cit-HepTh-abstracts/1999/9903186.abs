  We consider Type 0B D3-branes placed at conical singularities and analyze in
detail the conifold singularity. We study the non supersymmetric gauge theories
on their worldvolume and their conjectured dual gravity descriptions. In the
ultraviolet the solutions exhibit a logarithmic running of the gauge coupling.
In the infrared we find confining solutions and IR fixed points.
