Title: Conformal field theory: a case study
Author: Krzysztof Gawedzki
Comments: 55 pages, LaTex, 21 figures

  This is a set of introductory lecture notes devoted to the Wess-Zumino-Witten
model of two-dimensional conformal field theory. We review the construction of
the exact solution of the model from the functional integral point of view. The
boundary version of the theory is also briefly discussed.
