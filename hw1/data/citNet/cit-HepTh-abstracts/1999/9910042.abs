  In the first part of this paper I review the construction of the realistic
free fermionic models, as well as current attempts to study aspects of these
models in the nonperturbative framework of M- and F-theories. I discuss the
recent demonstration of a Minimal Superstring Standard Model, which contains in
the observable sector, below the string scale, solely the MSSM charged
spectrum, and provides further support to the assertion that the true string
vacuum is connected to the Z_2 X Z_2 orbifold in the vicinity of the free
fermionic point in the Narain moduli space. In the second part I review the
recent formulation of quantum mechanics from an equivalence postulate, which
offers a new perspective on the synthesis of gravity and quantum mechanics, and
contemplate possible relations with string theory and beyond.
