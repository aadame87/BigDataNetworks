  The non-renormalization of the 3-point functions $tr X^{k_1} tr X^{k_2} tr
X^{k_3}$ of chiral primary operators in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory is one of
the most striking facts to emerge from the AdS/CFT correspondence. A two-fold
puzzle appears in the extremal case, e.g. k_1 = k_2 + k_3. First, the
supergravity calculation involves analytic continuation in the k_i variables to
define the product of a vanishing bulk coupling and an infinite integral over
AdS. Second, extremal correlators are uniquely sensitive to mixing of the
single-trace operators $tr X^k$ with protected multi-trace operators in the
same representation of SU(4). We show that the calculation of extremal
correlators from supergravity is subject to the same subtlety of regularization
known for the 2-point functions, and we present a careful method which
justifies the analytic continuation and shows that supergravity fields couple
to single traces without admixture. We also study extremal n-point functions of
chiral primary operators, and argue that Type IIB supergravity requires that
their space-time form is a product of n-1 two-point functions (as in the free
field approximation) multiplied by a non-renormalized coefficient. This
non-renormalization property of extremal n-point functions is a new prediction
of the AdS/CFT correspondence. As a byproduct of this work we obtain the cubic
couplings $t \phi \phi$ and $s \phi \phi$ of fields in the dilaton and 5-sphere
graviton towers of Type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5 \times S^5$.
