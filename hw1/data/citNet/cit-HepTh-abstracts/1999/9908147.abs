  We investigate the formation of dynamical gaugino condensates and
supersymmetry breaking in the compactifications of Horava-Witten theory with
perturbative nonstandard embeddings. Specific models are considered where the
underlying massless charged states of the condensing sector are determined by
the spectra of $Z_2 \times Z_2 $ and $Z_4 $ orbifolds with nonstandard
embeddings. We find among them viable examples where gaugino condensation is
triggered on the wall with the weakest gauge coupling at $M_{GUT} $. In all
these cases the magnitude of the condensate formed is below the energy scales
at which extra dimensions are resolved, and so justifies the analysis of
condensation in an effective 4-dimensional framework. We make some comments
concerning the size of the largest extra dimension in the models considered. We
discuss racetrack scenarios in the framework of perturbative nonstandard
embeddings.
