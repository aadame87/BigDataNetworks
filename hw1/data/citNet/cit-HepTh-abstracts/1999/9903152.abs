  All Bianchi bialgebras have been obtained. By introducing a non-degenerate
adjoint invariant inner product over these bialgebras the associated Drinfeld
doubles have been constructed, then by calculating the coupling matrices for
these bialgebras several sigma-models with Poisson-Lie symmetry have been
obtained. Two simple examples as prototypes of Poisson-Lie dual models have
been given.
