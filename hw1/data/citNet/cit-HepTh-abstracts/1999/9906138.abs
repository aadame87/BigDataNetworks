  A scattering scattering description is proposed for a boundary perturbation
of a c=1 SL(2,Z) invariant conformal field theory. The bulk massless S-matrices
are of the form of Zamolodchikov's staircase model. Using the boundary version
of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the boundary free energy goes
through a series of integer valued plateaux as a function of system size.
