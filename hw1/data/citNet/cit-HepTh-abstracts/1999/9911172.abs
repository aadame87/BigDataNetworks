  We explicitly show the area law behavior of a circular Wilson loop in
confining theories from supergravity. We calculate the correlator of two Wilson
loops from supergravity in confining backgrounds. We find that it is dominated
by an exchange of a ``scalarball'' that is lighter than the glueballs. We
interpret these results in terms of the meson-meson potential in such theories.
