Title: Zero modes of the Dirac operator in three dimensions
Authors: C. Adam, B. Muratori, C. Nash
Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures, uses the macro psbox.tex, replaced by a revised
  version to be published in Phys. Rev. D. The section on the Seiberg-Witten
  equations, which contained a sign error, has been removed. This removal leads
  to further issues which will appear in a future publication

  We investigate zero modes of the Dirac operator coupled to an Abelian gauge
field in three dimensions. We find that the existence of a certain class of
zero modes is related to a specific topological property precisely when the
requirement of finite Chern--Simons action is imposed.
