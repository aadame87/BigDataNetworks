  In the Poincare patch of Minkovski AdS_5 we explicitly construct local bulk
fields from the boundary operators, to leading order in 1/N. We also construct
the Green's function implicitly defined by this procedure. We generalize the
construction of local fields for near horizon geometries of Dp branes. We try
to expand the procedure to the interacting case, with partial success.
