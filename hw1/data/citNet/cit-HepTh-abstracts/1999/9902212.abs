Title: Is the Standard Model Renormalizable?
Authors: Hung Cheng and S.P. Li

  In this paper, we study the renormalizability of the Standard Model in the
Landau gauge. On the basis of the Ward-Takahashi identities, we derive exact
expressions for the physical masses of the W and Z as well as the renormalized
coupling constants in the theory. We show that it is impossible to make all
these renormalized quantities finite. Thus the quantum theory of the Standard
Model with the divergent amplitudes obeying the Ward-Takahashi identities is
not renormalizable.
