  The global additive and multiplicative properties of the Laplacian on j-forms
and related zeta functions are analyzed. The explicit form of zeta functions on
a product of closed oriented hyperbolic manifolds \Gamma\backslash{\Bbb H}^d
and of the multiplicative anomaly are derived. We also calculate in an explicit
form the analytic torsion associated with a connected sum of such manifolds.
