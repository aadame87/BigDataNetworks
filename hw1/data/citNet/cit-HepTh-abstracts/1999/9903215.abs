  We study mass deformations of N=2 superconformal field theories with ADE
global symmetries on a D3-brane. The N=2 Seiberg-Witten curves with ADE
symmetries are determined by the Type IIB 7-brane backgrounds which are probed
by a D3-brane. The Seiberg-Witten differentials $\lambda$ for these ADE
theories are constructed. We show that the poles of $\lambda$ with residues are
located on the global sections of the bundle in an elliptic fibration. It is
then clearly seen how the residues transform in an irreducible representation
of the ADE groups. The explicit form of $\lambda$ depends on the choice of a
representation of the residues. Nevertheless the physics results are identical
irrespective of the representation of $\lambda$. This is considered as the
global symmetry version of the universality found in N=2 Yang-Mills theory with
local ADE gauge symmetries.
