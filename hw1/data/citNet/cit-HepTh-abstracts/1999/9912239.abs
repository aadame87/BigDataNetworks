  We give a general construction of correlation functions in rational conformal
field theory on a possibly non-orientable surface with boundary in terms of
3-dimensional topological quantum field theory. The construction applies to any
modular category. It is proved that these correlation functions obey modular
and factorization rules. Structure constants are calculated and expressed in
terms of the data of the modular category.
