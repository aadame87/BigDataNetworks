  A new version of holographic principle for cosmology is proposed, which
dictates that particle entropy within `cosmological apparent horizon' should
not exceed gravitational entropy associated with the apparent horizon. It is
shown that, in the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology, the open Universe
as well as a restricted class of flat cases are compatible with the principle,
whereas closed Universe is not. It is also found that inflationary Universe
after the big-bang is incompatible with the cosmic holography.
