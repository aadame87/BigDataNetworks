  We develop the canonical ADM approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity in presence
of point particles. The instantaneous York gauge can be applied for open
universes or universes with the topology of the sphere. The sequence of
canonical ADM equations is solved in terms of the conformal factor. A simple
derivation is given for the solution of the two body problem. A geometrical
characterization is given for the apparent singularities occurring in the
N-body problem and it is shown how the Garnier hamiltonian system arises in the
ADM treatment by considering the time development of the conformal factor at
the locations where the extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes.
