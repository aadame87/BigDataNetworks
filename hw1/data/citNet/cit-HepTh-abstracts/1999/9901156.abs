  The quantum effective theory of general relativity, independent of the
eventual full theory at high energy, expresses graviton-graviton scattering at
one loop order O(E^4) with only one parameter, Newton's constant. Dunbar and
Norridge have calculated the one loop amplitude using string based techniques.
We complete the calculation by showing that the 1/(d-4) divergence which
remains in their result comes from the infrared sector and that the cross
section is finite and model independent when the usual bremsstrahlung diagrams
are included.
