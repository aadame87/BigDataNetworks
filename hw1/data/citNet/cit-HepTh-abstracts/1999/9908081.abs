  The chiral symmetry breaking in the 4-dimensional QED with the chirally
invariant four-fermion interaction is discussed by using a novel path integral
expression in terms of the field-strength tensor. In the local potential
approximation, we find that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for any
nonzero gauge and four-fermion couplings on the tree level of an auxiliary
field $\sigma$. The present approach allows us to easily include higher orders
of the gauge coupling so that the effective potential up to the sixth order is
obtained.
