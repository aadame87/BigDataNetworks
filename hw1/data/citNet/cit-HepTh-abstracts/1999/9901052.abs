Title: Finite-temperature supersymmetry as a constrained supergravity
Authors: C. Lucchesi
Comments: 5 pages, LaTeX. Talk presented at ``Strong and Electroweak Matter
  98", Copenhagen, December 2-5 1998
\\
  We introduce thermal superspace and show how it can be used to reconcile the
superfield formulation of supersymmetry with finite temperature environments
