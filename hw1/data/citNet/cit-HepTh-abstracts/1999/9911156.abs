  We study the constraints on five-dimensional N=1 heterotic M-theory imposed
by a consistent anomaly-free coupling of bulk and boundary theory. This
requires analyzing the cancellation of triangle gauge anomalies on the
four-dimensional orbifold planes due to anomaly inflow from the bulk. We find
that the semi-simple part of the orbifold gauge groups and certain U(1)
symmetries have to be free of quantum anomalies. In addition there can be
several anomalous U(1) symmetries on each orbifold plane whose anomalies are
cancelled by a non-trivial variation of the bulk vector fields. The mixed U(1)
non-abelian anomaly is universal and there is at most one U(1) symmetry with
such an anomaly on each plane. In an alternative approach, we also analyze the
coupling of five-dimensional gauged supergravity to orbifold gauge theories. We
find a somewhat generalized structure of anomaly cancellation in this case
which allows, for example, non-universal mixed U(1) gauge anomalies. Anomaly
cancellation from the perspective of four-dimensional N=1 effective actions
obtained from E_8xE_8 heterotic string- or M-theory by reduction on a
Calabi-Yau three-fold is studied as well. The results are consistent with the
ones found for five-dimensional heterotic M-theory. Finally, we consider some
related issues of phenomenological interest such as model building with
anomalous U(1) symmetries, Fayet-Illiopoulos terms and threshold corrections to
gauge kinetic functions.
