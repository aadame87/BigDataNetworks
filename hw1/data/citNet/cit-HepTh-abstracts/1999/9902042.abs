  We construct the gauge field and graviton propagators in Euclidean AdS(d+1)
space-time by two different methods. In the first method the gauge invariant
Maxwell or linearized Ricci operator is applied directly to bitensor ansatze
for the propagators which reflect their gauge structure. This leads to a rapid
determination of the physical part of the propagators in terms of elementary
functions. The second method is a more traditional approach using covariant
gauge fixing which leads to a solution for both physical and gauge parts of the
propagators. The gauge invariant parts agree in both methods.
