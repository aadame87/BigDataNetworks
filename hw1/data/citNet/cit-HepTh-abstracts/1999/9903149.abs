  Motivated by the search for a space-time supersymmetric extension of the N=2
string, we construct a particle model which, upon quantization, describes
(abelian) self-dual super Yang-Mills in 2+2 dimensions. The local symmetries of
the theory are shown to involve both world-line supersymmetry and kappa
symmetry.
