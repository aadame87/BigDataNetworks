  We determine the spectrum of graviton excitations in the background geometry
of the AdS soliton in p+2 dimensions. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence this
corresponds to determining the spectrum of spin two excitations in the dual
effective p-dimensional field theories For the cases of D3- and M5-branes these
are the spin two glueballs of QCD_3 and QCD_4 respectively. For all values of p
we find an exact degeneracy of the spectra of these tensor states and certain
scalar excitations. Our results also extend the perturbative proof of a
positive energy conjecture for asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes
(originally proposed for p=3) to an arbritrary number of dimensions.
