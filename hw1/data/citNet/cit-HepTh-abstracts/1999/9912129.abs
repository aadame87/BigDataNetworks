  The problem of gauge independent definition of effective gravitational field
is considered from the point of view of the process of measurement. Under
assumption that dynamics of the measuring apparatus can be described by the
ordinary classical action, effective Slavnov identities for the generating
functionals of Green functions corresponding to a system of arbitrary
gravitational field measured by means of scalar particles are obtained. With
the help of these identities, the total gauge dependence of the non-local part
of the one-loop effective apparatus action, describing the long-range quantum
corrections, is calculated. The value of effective gravitational field inferred
from the effective apparatus action is found to be gauge-dependent. A probable
explanation of this result, referring to a peculiarity of the gravitational
interaction, is given.
