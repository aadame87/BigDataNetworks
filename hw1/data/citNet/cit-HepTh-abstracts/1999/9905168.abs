  Discrete analogs of the Darboux-Egoroff metrics are considered. It is shown
that the corresponding lattices in the Euclidean space are described by
discrete analogs of the Lame equations. It is proved that up to a gauge
transformation these equations are necessary and sufficient for discrete
analogs of rotation coefficients to exist. Explicit examples of the
Darboux-Egoroff lattices are constructed by means of algebro-geometric methods.
