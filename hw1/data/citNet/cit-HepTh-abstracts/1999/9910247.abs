  This is a reply to a recent comment (hep-th/9910158) by Park and Ho on a
paper (hep-th/9812013) that describes a derivation of black hole entropy from
horizon conformal field theory. The criticism of Park and Ho is partially
correct - the original paper did not give the complete surface term in the
Hamiltonian - but it does not affect the conclusions, which have been checked
using a somewhat different, manifestly covariant formalism (gr-qc/9906126).
