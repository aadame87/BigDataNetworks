  The correspondence between the 't Hooft limit of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory
and tree-level IIB superstring theory on AdS(5)xS(5) in a Ramond-Ramond
background at values of lambda=g^2 N ranging from infinity to zero is examined
in the context of unitarity. A squaring relation for the imaginary part of the
holographic scattering of identical string fields in the two-particle channels
is found, and a mismatch between weak and strong 't Hooft coupling is pointed
out within the correspondence. Several interpretations and implications are
proposed.
