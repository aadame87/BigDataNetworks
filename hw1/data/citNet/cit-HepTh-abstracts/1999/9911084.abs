  We give a simple proof of the known S-duality of Heterotic String theory
compactified on a T^6. Using this S-duality we calculate the tensions for a
class of BPS 5-branes in Heterotic String theory on a circle. One of these, the
Kaluza-Klein monopole, becomes tensionless when the radius of the circle is
equal to the string length. We study the question of stability of the Heterotic
NS5-brane with a transverse circle. For large radii the NS5-brane is absolutely
stable. However for small radii it is only marginally stable. We also study the
moduli space of 2 Kaluza-Klein monopoles and show that it is equal to the
moduli space of a Heterotic A_1 singularity.
