  The N=1 supersymmetric version of generalized 2d dilaton gravity can be cast
into the form of a Poisson Sigma Model, where the target space and its Poisson
bracket are graded. The target space consists of a 1+1 superspace and the
dilaton, which is the generator of Lorentz boosts therein. The Poisson bracket
on the target space induces the invariance of the worldsheet theory against
both diffeomorphisms and local supersymmetry transformations
(superdiffeomorphisms). The machinery of Poisson Sigma Models is then used to
find the general local solution to the field equations. As a byproduct,
classical equivalence between the bosonic theory and its supersymmetric
extension is found.
