  We study the moduli space ${\cal M}$ of N=(4,4) superconformal field theories
with central charge c=6. After a slight emendation of its global description we
find the locations of various known models in the component of ${\cal M}$
associated to K3 surfaces. Among them are the Z_2 and Z_4 orbifold theories
obtained from the torus component of ${\cal M}$. Here, SO(4,4) triality is
found to play a dominant role. We obtain the B-field values in direction of the
exceptional divisors which arise from orbifolding. We prove T-duality for the
Z_2 orbifolds and use it to derive the form of ${\cal M}$ purely within
conformal field theory. For the Gepner model (2)^4 and some of its orbifolds we
find the locations in ${\cal M}$ and prove isomorphisms to nonlinear sigma
models. In particular we prove that the Gepner model (2)^4 has a geometric
interpretation with Fermat quartic target space.
