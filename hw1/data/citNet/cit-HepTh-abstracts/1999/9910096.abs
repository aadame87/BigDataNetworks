  We review the theory of higher spin gauge fields in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional
anti-de Sitter space and present some new results on the structure of higher
spin currents and explicit solutions of the massless equations. A previously
obtained d=3 integrating flow is generalized to d=4 and is shown to give rise
to a perturbative solution of the d=4 nonlinear higher spin equations. A
particular attention is paid to the relationship between the star-product
origin of the higher spin symmetries, AdS geometry and the concept of
space-time locality.
