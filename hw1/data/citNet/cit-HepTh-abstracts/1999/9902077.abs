  We propose a method to construct quantum theory of matter fields in a
topology changing universe. Analytic continuation of the semiclassical gravity
of a Lorentzian geometry leads to a non-unitary Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a
Euclidean region of spacetime, which does not have a direct interpretation of
quantum theory of the Minkowski spacetime. In this Euclidean region we quantize
the Euclidean geometry, derive the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation and
find the quantum states using the Liouville-Neumann method. The Wick rotation
of these quantum states provides the correct Hilbert space of matter field in
the Euclidean region of the Lorentzian geometry. It is found that the direct
quantization of a scalar field in the Lorentzian geometry involves an unusual
commutation rule in the Euclidean region. Finally we discuss the interpretation
of the periodic solution of the semiclassical gravity equation in the Euclidean
geometry as a finite temperature solution for the gravity-matter system in the
Lorentzian geometry.
