  Magnetic monopole solutions to heterotic string theory are discussed in
toroidal compactifications to four spacetime dimensions. Particular emphasis is
placed on the relation to previously studied fivebrane solutions in ten
dimensions and on the possibility of constructing exact monopole solutions
related to symmetric fivebranes.
