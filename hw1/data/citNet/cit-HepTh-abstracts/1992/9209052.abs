  Generalizing our previous work, we show how $O(d,d)$ transformations can be
used to "boost away" in new dimensions the physical singularities that occur
generically in cosmological and/or black-hole string backgrounds. As an
example, we show how a recent model by Nappi and Witten can be made
singularity-free via $O(3,3)$ boosts involving a fifth dimension.
