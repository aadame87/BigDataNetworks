  When the $q$-deformed creation and annihilation operators are used in a
second quantization procedure, the algebra satisfied by basis vectors
(orthogonal complete set) should be also deformed such as a field operator
remains invariant under the coaction of the quantum group. In the 1+1
dimensional quantum field theories we deform the algebra of the basis vectors
and study the $q$-deformation in the second quantization procedure.
