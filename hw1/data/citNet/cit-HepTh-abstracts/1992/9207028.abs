  It is shown that the probability distribution $P(\lambda)$ for the effective
cosmological constant is sharply peaked at $\lambda=0$ in stochastic (or
"fifth-time") stabilized quantum gravity. The effect is similar to the
Baum-Hawking mechanism, except that it comes about due to quantum fluctuations,
rather than as a zeroth-order (in $\hbar$) semiclassical effect.
