  The propagation differential for bosonic strings on a complex torus
with three symmetric punctures is investigated. We study deformation aspects
between two point and three point differentials as well as the behaviour of the
corresponding Krichever-Novikov algebras. The structure constants are
calculated and from this we derive a central extension of the Krichever-Novikov
algebras by means of b-c systems. The defining cocycle for this central
extension deforms to the well known Virasoro cocycle for certain kinds of
degenerations of the torus.
