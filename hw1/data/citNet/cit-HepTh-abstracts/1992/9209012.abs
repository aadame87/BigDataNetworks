  A weak version of the cosmic censorship hypothesis is implemented as a set of
boundary conditions on exact semi-classical solutions of two-dimensional
dilaton gravity. These boundary conditions reflect low-energy matter from the
strong coupling region and they also serve to stabilize the vacuum of the
theory against decay into negative energy states. Information about low-energy
incoming matter can be recovered in the final state but at high energy black
holes are formed and inevitably lead to information loss at the semi-classical
level.
