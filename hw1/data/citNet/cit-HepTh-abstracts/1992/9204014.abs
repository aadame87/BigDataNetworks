  Beginning with the work of Dirac and Arnowitt, Deser, Misner in the late
fifties and early sixties, and then after subsequent development by Kucha\v r,
the canonical dynamical structure of general relativity has often been viewed
as that of a parametrized field theory in which the many-fingered spacetime
variables are hidden amongst the geometrodynamical field variables. This
paradigm of general relativity as an ``already parametrized theory'' forms the
basis for one of the most satisfactory resolutions of the problems of time and
observables in classical and quantum gravity. However, despite decades of
effort, no identification of many-fingered spacetime variables has ever been
satisfactorily obtained for vacuum general relativity. We point out that there
is an obstruction to identifying the constraint surface of general relativity
(for the case of a closed universe) with that of any parametrized theory.
Therefore, strictly speaking, general relativity cannot be viewed as a
parametrized field theory. We discuss implications for the canonical
quantization program.
