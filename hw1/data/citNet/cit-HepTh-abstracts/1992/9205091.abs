  In recent work, several classes of solitonic solutions of string theory with
higher-membrane structure have been obtained. These solutions can be classified
according to the symmetry possessed by the solitons in the subspace of the
spacetime transverse to the membrane. Solitons with four-dimensional spherical
symmetry represent instanton solutions in string theory, while those with
three-dimensional spherical symmetry represent magnetic monopole-type
solutions. For both of these classes, we discuss bosonic as well as heterotic
solutions.
