  A generalization of the $SU(2)$--spin systems on a lattice and their
continuum limit to an arbitrary compact group $G$ is discussed. The continuum
limits are, in general, non--relativistic $\sigma$--model type field theories
targeted on a homogeneous space $G/H$, where $H$ contains the maximal torus of
$G$. In the ferromagnetic case the equations of motion derived from our
continuum Lagrangian generalize the Landau--Lifshitz equations with quadratic
dispersion relation for small wave vectors. In the antiferromagnetic case the
dispersion law is always linear in the long wavelength limit. The models become
relativistic only when $G/H$ is a symmetric space. Also discussed are a
generalization of the Holstein--Primakoff representation of the $SU(N)$
algebra, the topological term and the existence of the instanton type solutions
in the continuum limit of the antiferromagnetic systems.
