  An action for two dimensional gravity conformally coupled to two dilaton-type
fields is analysed. Classically, the theory has some exact solutions. These
include configurations representing black holes. A semi-classical theory is
obtained by assuming that these singular solutions are caused by the collapse
of some matter fields. The semi-classical equations of motion reveal then that
any generic solution must have a flat geometry.
