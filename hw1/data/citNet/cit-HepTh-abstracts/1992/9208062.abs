  The order-disorder duality structure is exploited in order to obtain a
quantum description of anyons and vortices in: a) the Maxwell theory; b) the
Abelian Higgs Model; c) the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory; d) the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs theory. A careful construction of a charge bearing
order operator($\sigma$) and a magnetic flux bearing disorder operator (vortex
operator) ($\mu$) is performed, paying attention to the necessary requirements
for locality. An anyon operator is obtained as the product $\varphi=\sigma\mu$.
A detailed and comprehensive study of the euclidean correlation functions of
$\sigma$, $\mu$ and $\varphi$ is carried on in the four theories above. The
exact correlation functions are obtained in cases $\underline{a}$ and
$\underline{c}$. The large distance behavior of them is obtained in cases
$\underline{b}$ and $\underline{d}$. The study of these correlation functions
allows one to draw conclusions about the condensation of charge and magnetic
flux, establishing thereby an analogy with the Ising model. The mass of vortex
and anyon excitations is explicitly obtained wherever these excitations are
present in the spectrum. The independence between the mechanisms of mass
generation for the vortices and for the vector field is clearly exposed.
