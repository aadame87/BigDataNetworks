  We introduce the A-D-E resonance factorized models as an appropriate
analytical continuation of the Toda S-matrices to the complex values of their
coupling constant. An investigation of the associated Casimir energy, via the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, reveals a rich pattern of renormalization group
trajectories interpolating between the central charges of the $G_1 \otimes G_k
/ G_{k+1}$ GKO coset models. We have also constructed the simplest resonance
factorized model satisfying the ``$\phi^3$''-property. From this resonance
scattering, we predict new flows in non-unitary minimal models.
