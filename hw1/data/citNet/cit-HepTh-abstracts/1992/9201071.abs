  We consider BRST quantized 2D gravity coupled to conformal matter with
arbitrary central charge $c^M = c(p,q) < 1$ in the conformal gauge. We apply a
Lian-Zuckerman $SO(2,\bbc)$ ($(p,q)$ - dependent) rotation to Witten's $c^M =
1$ chiral ground ring. We show that the ring structure generated by the
(relative BRST cohomology) discrete states in the (matter $\otimes$ Liouville
$\otimes$ ghosts) Fock module may be obtained by this rotation. We give also
explicit formulae for the discrete states. For some of them we use new formulae
for $c <1$ Fock modules singular vectors which we present in terms of Schur
polynomials generalizing the $c=1$ expressions of Goldstone, while the rest of
the discrete states we obtain by finding the proper $SO(2,\bbc)$ rotation. Our
formulae give the extra physical states (arising from the relative BRST
cohomology) on the boundaries of the $p \times q$ rectangles of the conformal
lattice and thus all such states in $(1,q)$ or $(p,1)$ models.
