  We investigate the possibility of false vacuum decay in $N=1$ supergravity
theories. By establishing a Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy density stored in
the domain wall of the $O(4)$ invariant bubble, we show that supersymmetric
vacua remain absolutely stable against false vacuum decay into another
supersymmetric vacuum. This conforms with and completes the previous
perturbative analysis of Weinberg. Implications for dynamical supersymmetry
breaking and decompactification instabilities in superstring theory are
discussed. In addition, we show that there are no compact static spherical
domain walls.
