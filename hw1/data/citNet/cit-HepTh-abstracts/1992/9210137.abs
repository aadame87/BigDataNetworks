Title: Actions for Integrable Systems and Deformed Conformal Theories
Authors: Jeremy Schiff
Comments: (based on a talk given at the NSERC-CAP Workshop, "Quantum Groups,
  Integrable Models and Statistical Systems", Kingston, Ontario, Canada, July
  1992), 11 pages, plain tex, no figures, IASSNS-HEP-92/76

  I report on work on a Lagrangian formulation for the simplest 1+1 dimensional
integrable hierarchies. This formulation makes the relationship between
conformal field theories and (quantized) 1+1 dimensional integrable hierarchies
very clear.
