  The N=1,2 supergravities with non-zero cosmological constants are
investigated in the Ashtekar formalism. We solve the constraints of the N=1,2
supergravities semi-classically. The resulting WKB wave functions are expressed
by exponentials of supersymmetric-extended SL(2,C) Chern-Simons functional.
