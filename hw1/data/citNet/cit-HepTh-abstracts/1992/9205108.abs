Title: Exact Solutions in Bosonic and Heterotic String Theory
Authors: Ramzi R. Khuri
Comments: 11 pages
\\
  We review some exact solitonic solutions of string theory with
higher-membrane structure. These include an axionic instanton solution of
bosonic string theory as well as multi-instanton and multimonopole solutions of
heterotic string theory. The heterotic solutions reveal some interesting
aspects of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity.
