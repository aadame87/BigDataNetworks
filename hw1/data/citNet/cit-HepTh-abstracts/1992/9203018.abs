  In flat space, the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\o m (RN) black hole is
distinguished by its coldness (vanishing Hawking temperature) and its
supersymmetry. We examine RN solutions to Einstein-Maxwell theory with a
cosmological constant $\Lambda$, classifying the cold black holes and, for
positive $\Lambda$, the ``lukewarm" black holes at the same temperature as the
de Sitter thermal background. For negative $\Lambda$, we classify the
supersymmetric solutions within the context of $N=2$ gauged supergravity. One
finds supersymmetric analogues of flat-space extreme RN black holes, which for
nonzero $\Lambda$ differ from the cold black holes. In addition, there is an
exotic class of supersymmetric solutions which cannot be continued to flat
space, since the magnetic charge becomes infinite in that limit.
