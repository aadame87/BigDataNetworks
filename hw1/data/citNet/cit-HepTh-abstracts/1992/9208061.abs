  We study representations of Temperley-Lieb algebras associated with the
transfer matrix formulation of statistical mechanics on arbitrary  lattices. We
first discuss a new hyperfinite algebra, the Diagram algebra
$D_{\underline{n}}(Q)$, which is a quotient of the Temperley-Lieb algebra
appropriate for Potts models in the mean field case, and in which the algebras
appropriate for all transverse lattice shapes $G$ appear as subalgebras. We
give the complete structure of this subalgebra in the case ${\hat A}_n$ (Potts
model on a cylinder). The study of the Full Temperley Lieb algebra of graph $G$
reveals a vast number of infinite sets of inequivalent irreducible
representations characterized by one or more (complex) parameters associated to
topological effects such as links. We give a complete classification in the
${\hat A}_n$ case where the only such effects are loops and twists.
