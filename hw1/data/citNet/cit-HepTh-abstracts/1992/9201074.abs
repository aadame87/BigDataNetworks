  The formation and quantum mechanical evaporation of black holes in two
spacetime dimensions can be studied using effective classical field equations,
recently introduced by Callan {\it et al.} We find that gravitational collapse
always leads to a curvature singularity, according to these equations, and that
the region where the quantum corrections introduced by Callan {\it et al.}
could be expected to dominate is on the unphysical side of the singularity. The
model can be successfully applied to study the back-reaction of Hawking
radiation on the geometry of large mass black holes, but the description breaks
down before the evaporation is complete.
