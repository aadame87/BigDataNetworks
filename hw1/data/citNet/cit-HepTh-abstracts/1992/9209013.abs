  Our answer is the latter. Space-time singularities, including the initial
one, are described by world-sheet topological Abelian gauge theories with a
Chern-Simons term. Their effective $N=2$ supersymmetry provides an initial
fixed point where the Bogomolny bound is saturated on the world-sheet,
corresponding to an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution in space-time. Away
from the singularity the gauge theory has world-sheet matter fields, bosons and
fermions, associated with the generation of target space-time. Because the
fermions are complex (cf the Quantum Hall Effect) rather than real (cf
high-$T_c$ superconductors) the energetically-preferred vacuum is not parity or
time-reversal invariant, and the associated renormalization group flow explains
the cosmological arrow of time, as well as the decay of real or virtual black
holes, with a monotonic increase in entropy.
