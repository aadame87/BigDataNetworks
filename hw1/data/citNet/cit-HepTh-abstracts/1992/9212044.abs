Title: Third Quantization and Black Holes
Authors: Michael McGuigan
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  Recent results on the quantum mechanics of black holes indicate that the
spacetime singularity can be avoided if the space of fields is extended in its
domain as well as the vanishing of beta functions required as an equation in
target space. Such an approach seems to inevitably lead to the quantization in
this space that is the so-called third quantization. We discuss some of the
implications of third quantization for the physics of blackholes in two
dimensions. By discretizing the transverse dimensions describing the horizon it
may also be possible to describe regulated four dimensional gravity in this
manner and perhaps shed some light on the meaning of black hole entropy.
