Title: Low-Energy Effective Action of Superstring Theory
Authors: T.R. Taylor

  A fundamental task for the heterotic superstring theory is the determination
of the effective action describing the physics of massless string excitations
at low energies. This is necessary for the phenomenological applications of
string theory, in particular for the unification of gauge interactions and for
the gaugino condensation mechanism of supersymmetry breaking. In this talk, I
report on the recent progress in computing the effective supergravity action
from superstring scattering amplitudes, at the tree level and beyond. I discuss
moduli-dependent string loop corrections to gauge and Yukawa couplings. Talk
presented at the 7th Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of
Particles and Fields, Fermilab, November 10-14, 1992
