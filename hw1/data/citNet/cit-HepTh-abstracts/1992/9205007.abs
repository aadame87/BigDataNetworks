  In Rovelli and Smolin's loop representation of nonperturbative quantum
gravity in 4 dimensions, there is a space of solutions to the Hamiltonian
constraint having as a basis isotopy classes of links in R^3. The physically
correct inner product on this space of states is not yet known, or in other
words, the *-algebra structure of the algebra of observables has not been
determined. In order to approach this problem, we consider a larger space H of
solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint, which has as a basis isotopy classes
of tangles. A certain algebra T, the ``tangle algebra,'' acts as operators on
H. The ``empty state'', corresponding to the class of the empty tangle, is
conjectured to be a cyclic vector for T. We construct simpler representations
of T as quotients of H by the skein relations for the HOMFLY polynomial, and
calculate a *-algebra structure for T using these representations. We use this
to determine the inner product of certain states of quantum gravity associated
to the Jones polynomial (or more precisely, Kauffman bracket).
