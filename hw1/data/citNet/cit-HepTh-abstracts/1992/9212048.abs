  We point out the existence of an arithmetical symmetry for the commutant of
the modular matrices S and T. This symmetry holds for all affine simple Lie
algebras at all levels and implies the equality of certain coefficients in any
modular invariant. Particularizing to SU(3)_k, we classify the modular
invariant partition functions when k+3 is an integer coprime with 6 and when it
is a power of either 2 or 3. Our results imply that no detailed knowledge of
the commutant is needed to undertake a classification of all modular
invariants.
