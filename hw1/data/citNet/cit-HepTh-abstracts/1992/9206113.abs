  We develop a phase space path-integral approach for deriving the Lagrangian
realization of the models defined by Hamiltonian reduction of the WZNW theory.
We illustrate the uses of the approach by applying it to the models of
non-Abelian chiral bosons, $W$-algebras and the GKO coset construction, and
show that the well-known Sonnenschein's action, the generalized Toda action and
the gauged WZNW model are precisely the Lagrangian realizations of those
models, respectively.
