  We consider the possibility of using the hierarchical approximation to
understand the continuum limit of a reformulation of the 3D Ising model
initiated by Polyakov. We introduce several new formulations of the
hierarchical model using dual or fermionic variables. We discuss several
aspects of the renormalization group transformation in terms of these new
variables. We mention a reformulation of the model closely related to string
models proposed by Zabrodin.
