  The main aim of this work is to present the interpretation of the Ising type
models as a kind of field theory in the framework of noncommutative geometry.
We present the method and construct sample models of field theory on discrete
spaces using the introduced tools of discrete geometry. We write the action for
few models, then we compare them with various models of statistical physics. We
construct also the gauge theory with a discrete gauge group.
