  We re-examine the classification of supersymmetric extended objects in the
light of the recently discovered Type II p-branes, previously thought not to
exist for p> 1. We find new points on the brane-scan only in D = 10 and then
only for p = 3(Type IIB), p = 4 (Type IIA), p = 5 (Type IIA and IIB) and p = 6
(Type IIA). The case D = 10, p = 2 (Type IIA) also exists but is equivalent to
the previously classified D = 11 supermembrane.
