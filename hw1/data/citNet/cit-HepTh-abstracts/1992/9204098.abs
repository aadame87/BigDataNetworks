Title: Projections of Virasoro Singular Vectors
Authors: A. Kent
Comments: 11 pp
Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B278 (1992) 443-448
\\
  We use recently derived explicit formulae for the Virasoro algebra's singular
vectors to give constructive proofs of three results due to Feigin and Fuchs.
The main result, which is needed for a rigorous treatment of fusion, describes
the action of the singular vectors on conformal fields.
