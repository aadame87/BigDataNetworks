  Motivated by Harish-Chandra theory, we construct, starting from a simple
CDD\--pole $S$\--matrix, a hierarchy of new $S$\--matrices involving ever
``higher'' (in the sense of Barnes) gamma functions.These new $S$\--matrices
correspond to scattering of excitations in ever more complex integrable
models.From each of these models, new ones are obtained either by
``$q$\--deformation'', or by considering the Selberg-type Euler products of
which they represent the ``infinite place''. A hierarchic array of integrable
models is thus obtained. A remarkable diagonal link in this array is
established.Though many entries in this array correspond to familiar integrable
models, the array also leads to new models. In setting up this array we were
led to new results on the $q$\--gamma function and on the $q$\--deformed
Bloch\--Wigner function.
