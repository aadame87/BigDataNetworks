Title: A Proposal for $D>1$ Strings?
Authors: L. Alvarez-Gaume and J.L.F. Barbon
Comments: 23pp
\\
  Using the reduced formulation of large-N Quantum Field Theories we study
strings in space-time dimensions higher than one. Some preliminary results
concerning the possible string susceptibilities and general properties of the
model are presented.
