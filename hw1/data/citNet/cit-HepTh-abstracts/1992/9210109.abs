  We present a new lattice integrable system in one dimension of the
Haldane-Shastry type. It consists of spins positioned at the static equilibrium
positions of particles in a corresponding classical Calogero system and
interacting through an exchange term with strength inversely proportional to
the square of their distance. We achieve this by viewing the Haldane-Shastry
system as a high-interaction limit of the Sutherland system of particles with
internal degrees of freedom and identifying the same limit in a corresponding
Calogero system. The commuting integrals of motion of this system are found
using the exchange operator formalism.
