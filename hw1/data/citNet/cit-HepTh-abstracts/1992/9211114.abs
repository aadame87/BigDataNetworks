  Boundary conditions compatible with integrability are obtained for two
dimensional models by solving the factorizability equations for the reflection
matrices $K^{\pm}(\theta)$. For the six vertex model the general solution
depending on four arbitrary parameters is found. For the $A_{n-1}$ models all
diagonal solutions are found. The associated integrable magnetic Hamiltonians
are explicitly derived.
