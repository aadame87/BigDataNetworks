  We discuss the quantization of the 2d gravity theory of Callan, Giddings,
Harvey, and Strominger (CGHS), following the procedure of David, and of Distler
and Kawai. We find that the physics depends crucially on whether the number of
matter fields is greater than or less than 24. In the latter case the
singularity pointed out by several authors is absent but the physical
interpretation is unclear. In the former case (the one studied by CGHS) the
quantum theory which gives CGHS in the linear dilaton semi-classical limit, is
different from that which gives CGHS in the extreme Liouville regime.
