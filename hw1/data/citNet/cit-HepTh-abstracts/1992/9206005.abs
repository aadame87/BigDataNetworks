  An algebraic rule is presented for computing expectation values of products
of local nonabelian charge operators for fermions coupled to an external vector
potential in $3+1$ space-time dimensions. The vacuum expectation value of a
product of four operators is closely related to a cyclic cocycle in
noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes. The relevant representation of the
current is constructed using Kirillov's method of coadjoint orbits.
