  We propose gauging matrix models of string theory to eliminate unwanted
non-singlet states. To this end we perform a discretised light-cone
quantisation of large N gauge theory in 1+1 dimensions, with scalar or
fermionic matter fields transforming in the adjoint representation of SU(N).
The entire spectrum consists of bosonic and fermionic closed-string
excitations, which are free as N tends to infinity. We analyze the general
features of such bound states as a function of the cut-off and the gauge
coupling, obtaining good convergence for the case of adjoint fermions. We
discuss possible extensions of the model and the search for new non-critical
string theories.
