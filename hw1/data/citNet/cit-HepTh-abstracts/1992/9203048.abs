  Inhomogeneous quantum groups are shown to be an effective algebraic tool in
the study of integrable systems and to provide solutions equivalent to the
Bethe ansatz. The method is illustrated on the 1D Heisenberg ferromagnet whose
symmetry is shown to be the quantum Galilei group Gamma_q(1) here introduced.
Both the single magnon and the s=1/2 bound states of n-magnons are completely
described by the algebra.
