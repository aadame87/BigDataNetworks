  In this work the quantum theory of two dimensional dilaton black holes is
studied using the Wheeler De Witt equation. The solutions correspond to wave
functions of the black hole. It is found that for an observer inside the
horizon, there are uncertainty relations for the black hole mass and a
parameter in the metric determining the Hawking flux. Only for a particular
value of this parameter, can both be known with arbitrary accuracy. In the
generic case there is instead a relation which is very similar to the so called
string uncertainty relation.
