  Let H be the corner-transfer-matrix Hamiltonian for the six-vertex model in
the anti-ferroelectric regime. It acts on the infinite tensor product W = V . V
. V ....., where is the 2-dimensional irreducible representation of the quantum
affine sl(2). We observe that H is the derivation of quantum affine sl(2), and
conjecture that the eigenvectors of H form the level-1 vacuum representation of
quantum affine sl(2). We report on checks in support of our conjecture.
