  We show that a whole class of quantum actions for dilaton-gravity, which
reduce to the CGHS theory in the classical limit, can be written as a
Liouville-like theory. In a sub-class of this, the field space singularity
observed by several authors is absent, regardless of the number of matter
fields, and in addition it is such that the dilaton-gravity functional
integration range (the real line) transforms into itself for the Liouville
theory fields. We also discuss some problems associated with the usual
calculation of Hawking radiation, which stem from the neglect of back reaction.
We give an alternative argument incorporating back reaction but find that the
rate is still asymptotically constant. The latter is due to the fact that the
quantum theory does not seem to have a lower bound in energy and Hawking
radiation takes positive Bondi (or ADM) mass solutions to arbitrarily large
negative mass.
