  We are able to show that BF theories naturally emerge from the coadjoint
orbits of $W_2$ and $w_\infty$ algebras which includes a Kac-Moody sector.
Since QCD strings can be identified with a BF theory, we are able to show a
relationship between the orbits and monopole-string solutions of QCD.
Furthermore, we observe that when 4D gravitation is cast into a BF form through
the use of Ashtekar variables, we are able to get order $\hbar$ contributions
to gravity which can be associated with the $W_2$ anomaly. We comment on the
relationship to gravitational monopoles.
