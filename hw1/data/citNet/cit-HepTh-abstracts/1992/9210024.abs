  We study the quantum group gauge theory developed elsewhere in the limit when
the base space (spacetime) is a classical space rather than a general quantum
space. We show that this limit of the theory for gauge quantum group $U_q(g)$
is isomorphic to usual gauge theory with Lie algebra $g$. Thus a new kind of
gauge theory is not obtained in this way, although we do find some differences
in the coupling to matter. Our analysis also illuminates certain
inconsistencies in previous work on this topic where a different conclusion had
been reached. In particular, we show that the use of the quantum trace in
defining a Yang-Mills action in this setting is not appropriate.
