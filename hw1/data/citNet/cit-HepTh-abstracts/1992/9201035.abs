  The method of separation of variables is shown to apply to both the classical
and quantum Neumann model. In the classical case this nicely yields the
linearization of the flow on the Jacobian of the spectral curve. In the quantum
case the Schr\"odinger equation separates into one--dimensional equations
belonging to the class of generalized Lam\'e differential equations.
