Title: The Cosmological Kibble Mechanism in the Laboratory: String Formation in
  Liquid Crystals
Authors: Mark Bowick

  I report on the observation of the production of strings (disclination lines
and loops) via the Kibble mechanism of domain (bubble) formation in the
isotropic to nematic phase transition of a sample of uniaxial nematic liquid
crystal. The probablity of string formation per bubble is measured to be $0.33
\pm 0.01$. This is in good agreement with the theoretical value $1/ \pi$
expected in two dimensions for the order parameter space $S^2/{\bf Z}_2$ of a
simple uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. ( NB: The only change is a correction
of the preprint number for proper referencing and the title page.)
