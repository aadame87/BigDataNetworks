  Quantum field theory is discussed in M\"obius corner kaleidoscopes using the
method of images. The vacuum average of the stress-energy tensor of a free
field is derived and is shown to be a simple sum of straight cosmic string
expressions, the strings running along the edges of the corners. It does not
seem possible to set up a spin-half theory easily.
