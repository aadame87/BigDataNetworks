  The group theoretic method is extended to include fields with a background
charge. This formalism is used to compute the tree level scattering for $W_3$
strings. The scattering amplitudes involve Ising model correlation functions. A
detailed study of the four tachyon amplitude shows that the $W_3$ string must
possess additional states in its spectrum associated with intercept $1/2$ and
the energy operator of the Ising model.
