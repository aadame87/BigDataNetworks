  Improving on an earlier proposal, we construct the gauge theories of the
quantum groups $U_q(N)$. We find that these theories are consistent also with
an ordinary (commuting) spacetime. The bicovariance conditions of the quantum
differential calculus are essential in our construction. The gauge potentials
and the field strengths are $q$-commuting ``fields", and satisfy
$q$-commutation relations with the gauge parameters. The transformation rules
of the potentials are given explicitly, and generalize the ordinary
infinitesimal gauge variations. The $q$-lagrangian invariant under the $U_q(N)$
variations has the Yang-Mills form $\Fmn^i \Fmn^j g_{ij}$, the ``quantum
metric'' $g_{ij}$ being a generalization of the Killing metric.
