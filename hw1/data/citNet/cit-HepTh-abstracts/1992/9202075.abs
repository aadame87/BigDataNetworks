  We argue that, classically, $s$-wave electrons incident on a magnetically
charged black hole are swallowed with probability one: the reflection
coefficient vanishes. However, quantum effects can lead to both electromagnetic
and gravitational backscattering. We show that, for the case of extremal,
magnetically charged, dilatonic black holes and a single flavor of low-energy
charged particles, this backscattering is described by a perturbatively
computable and unitary $S$-matrix, and that the Hawking radiation in these
modes is suppressed near extremality. The interesting and much more difficult
case of several flavors is also discussed.
