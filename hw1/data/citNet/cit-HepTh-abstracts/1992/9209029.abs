  We comment on a program designed for the study of local chiral algebras and
their representations in 2D conformal field theory. Based on the algebraic
approach described by W. Nahm, this program efficiently calculates arbitrary
n-point functions of these algebras. The program is designed such that
calculations involving e.g. current algebras, W-algebras and N-Superconformal
algebras can be performed. As a non-trivial application we construct an
extension of the Virasoro algebra by two fields with spin four and six using
the N=1-Super-Virasoro algebra.
