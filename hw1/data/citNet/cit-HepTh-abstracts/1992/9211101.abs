Title: \delta-expansion and self-consistent calculation
Authors: Paulo F.Bedaque and Ashok Das
Comments: 8 pages, UR-1289

  We compare results from $\delta$--expansion, in simple theories, with
self--consistent calculations as well as calculations involving the principle
of minimal sensitivity. We show that the latter methods give relatively more
accurate results order by order.
