Title: Matrix Model for Discretized Moduli Space
Authors: L.Chekhov
\\
  We study the algebraic geometrical background of the Penner--Kontsevich
matrix model with the potential $N\alpha \tr {\bigl(- \fr 12 \L X\L X +\log
(1-X)+X\bigr)}$. We show that this model describes intersection indices of
linear bundles on the discretized moduli space right in the same fashion as the
Kontsevich model is related to intersection indices (cohomological classes) on
the Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genera. The special role of the logarithmic
potential originated from the Penner matrix model is demonstrated. The boundary
effects which was unessential in the case of the Kontsevich model are now
relevant, and intersection indices on the discretized moduli space of genus $g$
are expressed through Kontsevich's indices of the genus $g$ and of the lower
genera.
