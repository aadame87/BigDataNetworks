  Optimal hypercontractivity bounds for the fermion oscillator semigroup are
obtained. These are the fermion analogs of the optimal hypercontractivity
bounds for the boson oscillator semigroup obtained by Nelson. In the process,
several results of independent interest in the theory of non-commutative
integration are established. {}.
