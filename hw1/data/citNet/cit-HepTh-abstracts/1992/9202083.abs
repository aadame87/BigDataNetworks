Title: The General Class of String Theories on Orbifolds
Authors: Makoto Sakamoto and Masayoshi Tabuse
Comments: 35 pages
\\
  We investigate the following three consistency conditions for constructing
string theories on orbifolds: i) the invariance of the energy-momentum tensors
under twist operators, ii) the duality of amplitudes and iii) modular
invariance of partition functions. It is shown that this investigation makes it
possible to obtain the general class of consistent orbifold models, which
includes a new class of orbifold models.
