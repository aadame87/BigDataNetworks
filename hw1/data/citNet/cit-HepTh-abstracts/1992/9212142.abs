  In this paper we discuss the interplay among (~super-~)coordinate, Weyl and
\l\ anomaly both in chiral and non-chiral super-gravity represented by $(1,0)$
and $(1,1)$ two-dimensional models. It is shown that for this purpose two
regularization dependent parameters are needed in the effective action. We
discuss in {\it full generality} the regularization ambiguities of the induced
effective action and recover the corresponding general form of the anomalous
Ward Identities. Finally, we explain the difference between chiral and
non-chiral super-gravity models in terms of the free parameters and establish
relation between these two models by projecting $(1,1)$ into $(1,0)$
super-symmetry.
