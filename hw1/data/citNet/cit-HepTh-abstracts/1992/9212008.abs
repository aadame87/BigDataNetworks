Title: Extending the Barnes-Rivers Operators to D=3 Topological Gravity
Authors: C. Pinheiro and G. O. Pires
Comments: Latex 10 pages
\\
  The spin-projector operators for symmetric rank-2 tensors are reassessed in
connection with the issue of topologically massive gravity. The original
proposal by Barnes and Rivers is generalised to account for D-dimensional
Einstein gravity and 3-dimensional Chern-Simons massive gravitation.
