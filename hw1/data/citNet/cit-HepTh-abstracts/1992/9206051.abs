  An O($\tilde{d}$, $\tilde{d}$) transformation is given which relates ungauged
string actions to the gauged ones for a large class of models discussed
recently by Giveon and Rocek. Interestingly, the transformation is background
independent and has a unique matrix representation in a given space-time
dimension.
