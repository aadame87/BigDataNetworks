  The 1/N expansion for the O(N) vector model in four dimensions is
reconsidered. It is emphasized that the effective potential for this model
becomes everywhere complex just at the critical point, which signals an
unstable vacuum. Thus a critical O(N) vector model cannot be consistently
defined in the 1/N expansion for four-dimensions, which makes the existence of
a double-scaling limit for this theory doubtful.
