  An exact multimonopole solution of heterotic string theory is presented. The
solution is constructed by a modification of the 't Hooft ansatz for a
four-dimensional instanton. An analogous solution in Yang-Mills field theory
saturates a Bogomoln'yi bound and possesses the topology and far field limit of
a multimonopole configuration, but has divergent action near each source. In
the string solution, however, the divergences from the Yang-Mills sector are
precisely cancelled by those from the gravity sector. The resultant action is
finite and easily computed. The Manton metric on moduli space for the
scattering of two string monopoles is found to be flat to leading order in the
impact parameter, in agreement with the trivial scattering predicted by a test
monopole calculation.
