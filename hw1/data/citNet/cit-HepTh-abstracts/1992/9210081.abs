  Quantization of two dimensional chiral matter coupled to gravity induces an
effective action for the zweibein field which is both Weyl and Lorentz
anomalous. Recently, the quantization of this induced action has been analyzed
in the light-cone gauge as well as in the conformal gauge. An apparent mismatch
between the results obtained in the two gauges is analyzed and resolved by
properly treating the Lorentz field as a chiral boson.
