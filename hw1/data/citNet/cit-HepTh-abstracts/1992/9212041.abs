  Time-dependent domain wall solutions with infinitesimal thickness are
obtained in the theory of a scalar field coupled to gravity with the dilaton,
i.e. the Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. The value of the dilaton is determined in
terms of the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. In particular, the solutions exist
for any $\omega>0$ and as $\omega\to\infty$ we obtain new solutions in general
relativity. They have horizons whose sizes depend on $\omega$.
