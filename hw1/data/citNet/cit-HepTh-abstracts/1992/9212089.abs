  We discuss the relationship between target space modular invariance and
discrete gauge symmetries in four-dimensional orbifold-like strings. First we
derive the modular transformation properties of various string vertex operators
of the massless string fields. Then we find that for supersymmetric
compactifications the action of the duality elements, leaving invariant the
multicritical points, corresponds to a combination of finite K\"ahler and gauge
transformations. However, those finite gauge transformations are not elements
of a remnant discrete gauge symmetry. We suggest that, at least in the case of
Gepner models corresponding to tensor products of identical minimal models, the
duality element leaving invariant the multicritical point corresponds to the
${\bf Z}_{k+2}$ symmetry of any of the minimal $N=2$ models appearing in the
tensor product.
