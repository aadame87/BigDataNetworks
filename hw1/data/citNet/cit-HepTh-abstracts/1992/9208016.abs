  This paper (completed March 1992) is an extensively revised and expanded
version of work which appeared July 1991 on the initial incarnation of the
hepth bulletin board, and which was published in the Proceedings of the
Workshop on String Theory, Trieste, March 1991. Abstract We present a
hamiltonian quantization of the $SL(2,R)$ 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory
with fractional coupling constant $k=s/r$ on a space manifold with torus
topology in the ``constrain-first'' framework. By generalizing the ``Weyl-odd''
projection to the fractional charge case, we obtain multi-components
holomorphic wave functions whose components are the Kac-Wakimoto characters of
the modular invariant admissible representations of ${\hat A}_1$ current
algebra with fractional level. The modular representations carried by the
quantum Hilbert space satisfy both Verlinde's and Vafa's constraints coming
from conformal field theory. They are the ``square-roots'' of the
representations associated to the conformal $(r,s)$ minimal models. Our results
imply that Chern-Simons theory with $SO(2,2)$ as gauge group, which describes
$2+1$-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant, has the modular
properties of the Virasoro discrete series. On the way, we show that the
2-dimensional counterparts of Chern-Simons $SU(2)$ theories with half-integer
charge $k=p/2$
