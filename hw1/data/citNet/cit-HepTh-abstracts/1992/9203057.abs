  Considerable interest has recently been expressed in (static spherically
symmetric) blackholes in interaction with various classical matter fields (such
as electromagnetic fields, dilaton fields, axion fields, Abelian Higgs fields,
non--Abelian gauge fields, {\sl etc}). A common feature of these investigations
that has not previously been remarked upon is that the Hawking temperature of
such systems appears to be suppressed relative to that of a vacuum blackhole of
equal horizon area. That is: $k T_H \leq \hbar/(4\pi r_H) \equiv
\hbar/\sqrt{4\pi A_H}$. This paper will argue that this suppression is generic.
Specifically, it will be shown that
 \[ k T_H = {\hbar\over4\pi r_H} \; e^{-\phi(r_H)} \;
               \left( 1 - 8\pi G \; \rho_H \; r_H^2 \right). \]
 Here $\phi(r_H)$ is an integral quantity, depending on the distribution of
matter, that is guaranteed to be positive if the Weak Energy Condition is
satisfied. Several examples of this behaviour will be discussed.
Generalizations of this behaviour to non--symmetric non--static blackholes
are conjectured.
