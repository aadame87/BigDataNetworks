  It is shown explicitly, that a number of solutions for the background field
equations of the string effective action in space-time dimension D can be
generated from any known lower dimensional solution, when background fields
have only time dependence. An application of the result to the two dimensional
charged black hole is presented. The case of background with more general
coordinate dependence is also discussed.
