  We consider GLq(N)-covariant quantum algebras with generators satisfying
quadratic polynomial relations. We show that, up to some inessential
arbitrariness, there are only two kinds of such quantum algebras, namely, the
algebras with q-deformed commutation and q-deformed anticommutation relations.
The connection with the bicovariant differential calculus on the linear quantum
groups is disscussed.
