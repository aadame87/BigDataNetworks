  This paper revisits the conundrum faced when one attempts to understand the
dynamics of black hole formation and evaporation without abandoning unitary
evolution. Previous efforts to resolve this puzzle assume that information
escapes in corrections to the Hawking process, that an arbitrarily large amount
of information is transmitted by a planckian energy or contained in a
Planck-sized remnant, or that the information is lost to another universe. Each
of these possibilities has serious difficulties. This paper considers another
alternative: remnants that carry large amounts of information and whose size
and mass depend on their information content. The existence of such objects is
suggested by attempts to incorporate a Planck scale cutoff into physics. They
would greatly alter the late stages of the evaporation process. The main
drawback of this scenario is apparent acausal behavior behind the horizon.
