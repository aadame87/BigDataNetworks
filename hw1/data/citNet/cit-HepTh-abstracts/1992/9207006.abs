  We study canonical quantization of a class of 2d dilaton gravity models,
which contains the model proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger. A
set of non-canonical phase space variables is found, forming an $SL(2,{\bf R})
\times U(1)$ current algebra, such that the constraints become quadratic in
these new variables. In the case when the spatial manifold is compact, the
corresponding quantum theory can be solved exactly, since it reduces to a
problem of finding the cohomology of a free-field Virasoro algebra. In the
non-compact case, which is relevant for 2d black holes, this construction is
likely to break down, since the most general field configuration cannot be
expanded into Fourier modes. Strategy for circumventing this problem is
discussed.
