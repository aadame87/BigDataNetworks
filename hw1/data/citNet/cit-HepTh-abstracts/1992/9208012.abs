  We investigate a class of operators with non-vanishing averages in a
D-dimensional matrix model recently proposed by Kazakov and Migdal. Among the
operators considered are ``filled Wilson loops" which are the most reasonable
counterparts of Wilson loops in the conventional Wilson formulation of lattice
QCD. The averages of interest are represented as partition functions of certain
2-dimensional statistical systems with nearest neighbor interactions. The
``string tension" $\alpha'$, which is the exponent in the area law for the
``filled Wilson loop" is equal to the free energy density of the corresponding
statistical system. The continuum limit of the Kazakov--Migdal model
corresponds to the critical point of this statistical system. We argue that in
the large $N$ limit this critical point occurs at zero temperature. In this
case we express $\alpha'$ in terms of the distribution density of eigenvalues
of the matrix-valued master field. We show that the properties of the continuum
limit and the description of how this limit is approached is very unusual and
differs drastically from what occurs in both the Wilson theory ($S\propto({\rm
Tr}\prod U +{\rm c.c.})$) and in the ``adjoint'' theory ($S\propto\vert{\rm
Tr}\prod U\vert^2$). Instead, the continuum limit of the model appears to be
intriguingly similar to a $c>1$ string theory.
