Authors: Fedor A. Smirnov
Comments: 12 pages. AMS TEX, RIMS-860
\\
  Deformed and undeformed KZ equations are considered for $k=0$. It is shown
that they allow the same number of solutions, one being the asymptotics of
others. Essential difference in analitical properties of the solutions is
explained.
