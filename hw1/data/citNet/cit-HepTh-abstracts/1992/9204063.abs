  We solve Virasoro constraints on the KP hierarchy in terms of minimal
conformal models. The constraints we start with are implemented by the Virasoro
generators depending on a background charge $Q$. Then the solutions to the
constraints are given by the theory which has the same field content as the
David-Distler-Kawai theory: it consists of a minimal matter scalar with
background charge $Q$, dressed with an extra `Liouville' scalar. The
construction is based on a generalization of the Kontsevich parametrization of
the KP times achieved by introducing into it Miwa parameters which depend on
the value of $Q$. Under the thus defined Kontsevich-Miwa transformation, the
Virasoro constraints are proven to be equivalent to a master equation depending
on the parameter $Q$. The master equation is further identified with a
null-vector decoupling equation. We conjecture that $W^{(n)}$ constraints on
the KP hierarchy are similarly related to a level-$n$ decoupling equation. We
also consider the master equation for the $N$-reduced KP hierarchies. Several
comments are made on a possible relation of the generalized master equation to
{\it scaled} Kontsevich-type matrix integrals and on the form the equation
takes in higher genera.
