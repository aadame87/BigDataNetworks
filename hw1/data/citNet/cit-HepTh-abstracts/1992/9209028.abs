  We give a general procedure for extracting the propagators in gauge theories
in presence of a sharp gauge fixing and we apply it to derive the propagators
in quantum gravity in the radial gauge, both in the first and in the second
order formalism in any space-time dimension. In the three dimensional case such
propagators vanish except for singular collinear contributions, in agreement
with the absence of propagating gravitons.
