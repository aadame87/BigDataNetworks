  We explore the possibility of string theories in only four spacetime
dimensions without any additional compactified dimensions. We show that,
provided the theory is defined in curved spacetime that has a cosmological
interpration, it is possible to construct consistent heterotic string theories
based on a few non-compact current algebra cosets. We classify these models.
The gauge groups that emerge fall within a remarkably narrow range and include
the desirable low energy flavor symmetry of $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. The
quark and lepton states, which come in color triplets and $SU(2)$ doublets, are
expected to emerge in several families.
