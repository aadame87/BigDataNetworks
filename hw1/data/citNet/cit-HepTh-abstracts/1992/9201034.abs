  We review the BRST analysis of the system of a (super)conformal matter
coupled to 2D (super)gravity. The spectrum and its operator realization are
reported. In particular, the operators associated with the states of nonzero
ghost number are given. We also discuss the ground ring structure of the
super-Liouville coupled to ${\hat c}=1$ matter. In appendices, hermiticities,
states for $c<1$ conformal matter coupled to gravity and the proof for the
spectrum are discussed.
