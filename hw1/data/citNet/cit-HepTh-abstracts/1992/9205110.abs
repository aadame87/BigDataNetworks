  and topological field theories

\\
  The universal Witham hierarchy is considered from the point of view of
topological field theories. The $\tau$-function for this hierarchy is defined.
It is proved that the algebraic orbits of Whitham hierarchy can be identified
with various topological matter models coupled with topological gravity.
