  A framework for background independent open-string field theory is proposed.
The approach involves using the BV formalism -- in a way suggested by recent
developments in closed-string field theory -- to implicitly define a gauge
invariant Lagrangian in a hypothetical ``space of all open-string world-sheet
theories.'' It is built into the formalism that classical solutions of the
string field theory are BRST invariant open-string world-sheet theories and
that, when expanding around a classical solution, the infinitesimal gauge
transformations are generated by the world-sheet BRST operator.
