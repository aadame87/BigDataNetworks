  We recall the classification of the irreducible representations of $SL(2)_q$,
and then give fusion rules for these representations. We also consider the
problem of $\cR$-matrices, intertwiners of the differently ordered tensor
products of these representations, and satisfying altogether Yang--Baxter
equations.
