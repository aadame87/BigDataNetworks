  A new string theory is proposed as a candidate for the large N limit of QCD.
In this theory, strings are constrained to be non-backtracking; a condition
that is essential for the gauge invariance of the underlying field theory.This
condition is implemented by first placing the theory on a lattice and then
introducing fermionic variables on the world sheet. The naive continuum limit
leads to a generalized Thirring model on the world sheet,and it is suggested
that the application of the renormalization group should drive the coupling
constants to a conformally invariant fixed point.
