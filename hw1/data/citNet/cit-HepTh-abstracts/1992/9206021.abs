  There is a large mathematical literature on classical mechanics and field
theory, especially on the relationship to symplectic geometry. One might think
that the classical Chern-Simons theory, which is topological and so has
vanishing hamiltonian, is completely trivial. However, this theory exhibits
interesting geometry that is usually absent from ordinary field theories. (The
same is true on the quantum level; topological quantum field theories exhibit
geometric properties not usually seen in ordinary quantum field theories, and
they lack analytic properties which are usually seen.) In this paper we
carefully develop this geometry. Of particular interest are the line bundles
with connection over the moduli space of flat connections on a 2-manifold. We
extend the usual theory to cover 2-manifolds with boundary. We carefully
develop ``gluing laws'' in all of our constructions, including the line bundle
with connection over moduli space. The corresponding quantum gluing laws are
fundamental. Part 1 covers connected and simply connected gauge groups; Part 2
will cover arbitrary compact Lie groups.
