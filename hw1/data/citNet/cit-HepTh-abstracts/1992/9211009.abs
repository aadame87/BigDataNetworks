  A new 2-parameter quadratic deformation of the quantum oscillator algebra and
its 1-parameter deformed Heisenberg subalgebra are considered. An infinite
dimensional Fock module representation is presented which at roots of unity
contains null vectors and so is reducible to a finite dimensional
representation. The cyclic, nilpotent and unitary representations are
discussed. Witten's deformation of $sl_2$ and some deformed infinite
dimensional algebras are constructed from the $1d$ Heisenberg algebra
generators. The deformation of the centreless Virasoro algebra at roots of
unity is mentioned. Finally the $SL_q(2)$ symmetry of the deformed Heisenberg
algebra is explicitly constructed.
