  In a recent paper, the BRST formalism for the gauge-fixed N=2 twistor-string
was used to calculate Green-Schwarz supersring scattering amplitudes with an
arbitrary number of loops and external massless states. Although the
gauge-fixing procedure preserved the worldsheet N=2 superconformal invariance
of the twistor-string, it broke the target-space SO(9,1) super-Poincar\'e
invariance down to an SU(4)xU(1) subgroup. In this paper, generators for the
SO(9,1) super-Poincar\'e transformations, as well as manifestly covariant
vertex operators, are explicitly constructed out of the gauge-fixed matter
fields. The earlier calculated amplitudes are then expressed in manifestly
Lorentz-covariant notation.
