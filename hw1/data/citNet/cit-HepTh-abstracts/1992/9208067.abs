  The restricted solid-on-solid models in the anti-ferromagnetic regime is
studied in the framework of quantum affine algebras. Following the line
developed recently for vertex models, a representation theoretical picture is
presented for the structure of the space of states. The local operators and the
creation/annihilation operators of quasi-particles are defined using vertex
operators, and their commutation relations are calculated.
