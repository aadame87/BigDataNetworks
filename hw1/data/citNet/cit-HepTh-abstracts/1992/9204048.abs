  We show that it is possible to formulate Abelian Chern-Simons theory on a
lattice as a topological field theory. We discuss the relationship between
gauge invariance of the Chern-Simons lattice action and the topological
interpretation of the canonical structure. We show that these theories are
exactly solvable and have the same degrees of freedom as the analogous
continuum theories.
