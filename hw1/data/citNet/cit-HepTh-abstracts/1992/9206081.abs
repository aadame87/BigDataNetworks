  We formulate quantum gravity in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions in such a way that
the conformal mode is explicitly separated. The dynamics of the conformal mode
is understood in terms of the oversubtraction due to the one loop counter term.
The renormalization of the gravitational dressed operators is studied and their
anomalous dimensions are computed. The exact scaling exponents of the 2
dimensional quantum gravity are reproduced in the strong coupling regime when
we take $\epsilon\rightarrow0$ limit. The theory possesses the ultraviolet
fixed point as long as the central charge $c<25$, which separates weak and
strong coupling phases. The weak coupling phase may represent the same
universality class with our Universe in the sense that it contains massless
gravitons if we extrapolate $\epsilon$ up to 2.
