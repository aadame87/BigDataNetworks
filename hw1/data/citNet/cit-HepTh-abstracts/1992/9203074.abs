  We make a change of field variables in the J formulation of self-dual
Yang--Mills theory. The field equations for the resulting algebra valued field
are derivable from a simple cubic action. The cubic interaction vertex is
different from that considered previously from the N=2 string, however,
perturbation theory with this action shows that the only non-vanishing
connected scattering amplitude is for three external particles just as for the
string.
