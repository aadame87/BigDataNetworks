  We investigate the system of holomorphic differential identities implied by
special K\"ahlerian geometry of four-dimensional N=2 supergravity. For
superstring compactifications on \cy threefolds these identities are equivalent
to the Picard-Fuchs equations of algebraic geometry that are obeyed by the
periods of the holomorphic three-form. For one variable they reduce to linear
fourth-order equations which are characterized by classical $W$-generators; we
find that the instanton corrections to the Yukawa couplings are directly
related to the non-vanishing of $w_4$. We also show that the symplectic
structure of special geometry can be related to the fact that the Yukawa
couplings can be written as triple derivatives of some holomorphic function
$F$. Moreover, we give the precise relationship of the Yukawa couplings of
special geometry with three-point functions in topological field theory.
