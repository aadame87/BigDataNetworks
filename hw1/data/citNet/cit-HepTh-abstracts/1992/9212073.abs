  We consider a random surface representation of the three-dimensional Ising
model.The model exhibit scaling behaviour and a new critical index $\k$ which
relates $\g_{string}$ for the bosonic string to the exponent $\a$ of the
specific heat of the 3d Ising model is introduced. We try to determine $\k$ by
numerical simulations.
