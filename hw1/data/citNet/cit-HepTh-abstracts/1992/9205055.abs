  A new approach to the correlation functions is presented for the XXZ model
in the anti-ferroelectric regime. The method is based on the recent realization
of the quantum affine symmetry using vertex operators. With the aid of a boson
representation for the latter, an integral formula is found for correlation
functions of arbitrary local operators. As a special case it reproduces the
spontaneous staggered polarization obtained earlier by Baxter.
