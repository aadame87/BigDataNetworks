  We rederive the $w_\infty$ Ward identities, starting from the existence of
trivial linearized gauge invariances, and using the method of canceled
propagators in the operator formalism. Recursion relations for certain classes
of correlation functions are derived, and these correlation function are
calculated exactly. We clarify the relation of these results with another
derivation of the Ward identities, which relies directly on charge
conservation. We also emphasize the importance of the kinematics of canceled
propagators in ensuring that the Ward identities are non-trivial. Finally, we
sketch an extension of Ward identities to open strings.
