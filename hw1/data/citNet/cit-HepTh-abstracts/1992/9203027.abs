  The statistics-altering operators present in the limit $q=-1$ of
multiparticle SU_q(2)-invariant subspaces parallel the action of such operators
which naturally occur in supersymmetric theories. We illustrate this
heuristically by comparison to a toy $N=2$ superymmetry algebra, and ask
whether there is a supersymmetry structure underlying SU(2)_q at that limit. We
remark on the relevance of such alternating-symmetry multiplets to the
construction of invariant hamiltonians.
