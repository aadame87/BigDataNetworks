Title: String Theory: Lessons for Low Energy Physics
Authors: Michael Dine
Comments: 13 pages, SCIPP 92/36. Should be easier to tex than previously

  This talk considers possible lessons of string theory for low energy physics.
These are of two types. First, assuming that string theory is the correct
underlying theory of all interactions, we ask whether there are any generic
predictions the theory makes, and we compare the predictions of string theory
with those of conventional grand unified theories. Second, string theory offers
some possible answers to a number of troubling naturalness questions. These
include problems of discrete and continuous symmetries in general, and CP and
the strong CP problem in particular.
