  The problem of interpreting a set of ${\cal W}$-algebra constraints
constructed in terms of an arbitrarily twisted scalar field as the recursion
relations of a topological theory is addressed. In this picture, the
conventional models of topological gravity coupled to $A$, $D$ or $E$
topological matter, correspond to taking the scalar field twisted by the
Coxeter element of the Weyl group. It turns out that not all conjugacy classes
of the Weyl group lead to a topological model. For example, it is shown that
for the $A$ algebras there are two possible choices for the conjugacy class,
giving both the conventional and a new series of topological models.
Furthermore, it is shown how the new series of theories contains the
conventional series as a subsector. A tentative interpretation of this new
series in terms of intersection theory is presented.
