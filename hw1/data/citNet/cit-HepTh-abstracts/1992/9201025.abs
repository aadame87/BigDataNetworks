  The current algebra of classical non-linear sigma models on arbitrary
Riemannian manifolds is analyzed. It is found that introducing, in addition to
the Noether current $j_\mu$ associated with the global symmetry of the theory,
a composite scalar field $j$, the algebra closes under Poisson brackets.
