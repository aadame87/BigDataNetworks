  We derive a continuum field theory for the Majumdar-Ghosh model in the
large-$S$ limit, where the field takes values in the manifold of the $SO(3)$
group. No topological term is induced in the action and the cases for integer
spin and half-integer spin appear to be indistinguishable. A one-loop $\beta
-$function calculation indicates that the theory flows towards a strong
coupling (disordered) phase at long distances. This is verified in the
large-$N$ limit, where all excitations are shown to be massive. (Three figures
not included)
