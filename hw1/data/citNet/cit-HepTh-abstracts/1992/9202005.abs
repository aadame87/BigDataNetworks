  We construct an exact CFT as an SL(2,R)xSU(2)/U(1)^2 gauged WZW model, which
describes a black hole in 4 dimensions. Another exact solution, describing a
black membrane in 4D (in the sense that the event horizon is an infinite plane)
is found as an SL(2,R)xU(1)^2/U(1) gauged WZW model. Finally, we construct an
exact solution of a 4D black hole with electromagnetic field, as an
SL(2,R)xSU(2)xU(1)/U(1)^2 gauged WZW model. This black hole carries both
electric and axionic charges.
