  We propose that the correlation functions of the inhomogeneous eight vertex
model in the anti-ferroelectric regime satisfy a system of difference equations
with respect to the spectral parameters. Solving the simplest difference
equation we obtain the expression for the spontaneous staggered polarization
conjectured by Baxter and Kelland. We discuss also a related construction of
vertex operators on the lattice.
