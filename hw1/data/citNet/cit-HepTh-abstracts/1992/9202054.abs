  The recently proposed loop representation, used previously to find exact
solutions to the quantum constraints of general relativity, is here used to
quantize linearized general relativity. The Fock space of graviton states and
its associated algebra of observables are represented in terms of functionals
of loops. The ``reality conditions'' are realized by an inner product that is
chiral asymmetric, resulting in a chiral asymmetric ordering for the
Hamiltonian and in an asymmetric description of the left and right handed
gravitons. This chirally asymmetric formulation depends on a splitting of the
linearized field into self-dual and anti-self dual parts rather than into
positive and negative frequency parts; as the former, but not the latter, is
meaningful away from flat backgrounds this is expected to be useful in
connecting the nonperturbative theory to the linearized theory. The formalism
depends on an arbitrary ``averaging'' function that controls certain
divergences, but does not appear in the final physical quantities. Inspite of
these somewhat unusual features, the loop quntization presented here is
completely equivalent to the standard quantization of linearized gravity.
