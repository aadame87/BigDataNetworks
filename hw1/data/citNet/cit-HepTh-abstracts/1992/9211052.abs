  In this paper a class of conformal field theories with nonabelian and
discrete group of symmetry is investigated. These theories are realized in
terms of free scalar fields starting from the simple $b-c$ systems and scalar
fields on algebraic curves. The Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the
conformal blocks can be explicitly solved. Besides of the fact that one obtains
in this way an entire class of theories in which the operators obey a
nonstandard statistics, these systems are interesting in exploring the
connection between statistics and curved space-times, at least in the two
dimensional case.
