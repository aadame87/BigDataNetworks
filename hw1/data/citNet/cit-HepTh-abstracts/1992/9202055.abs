Title: Canonical Quantization of 2d Gravity Coupled to c<1 Matter

  We study 2d gravity coupled to $c,1$ matter through canonical quantization of
a free scalar field, with background charge, coupled to gravity. Various
features of the theory can be more easily understood in the canonical approach,
like gauge indipendence of the path-integral results and the absence of the
local physical degrees of freedom. By performing a non-canonical transformation
of the phase space variables, we show that the theory takes a free-field form,
i.e. the constraints become the free-field Virasoro constraints. This implies
that the David-Distler-Kawai results can be derived in the gauge indipendent
way, and also proves the free-field assumption which was used for obtaining the
spectrum of the theory in the conformal gauge. A discussion of the physical
spectrum of the theory is presented, with an analysis of the unitarity of the
discrete momentum states.
