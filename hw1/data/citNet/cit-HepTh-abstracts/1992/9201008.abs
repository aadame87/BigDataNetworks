  The Coulomb gas representations are presented for the ${\rm
SU(2)}$$_k$-extended $N$=4 superconformal algebras, incorporating the
Feigin-Fuchs representation of the\break ${\rm SU(2)}$$_k$ Kac-Moody algebra
with {\sl arbitrary} level $k$. Then the long-standing problem of identifying
the whole set of charge-screening operators for the $N$=4 superconformal
algebras is solved and their explicit expressions are given. The method of
achieving a rigorous proof of the $N$=4 Kac determinant formulae following Kato
and Matsuda is suggested. The complete proof for them will be given elsewhere.
Our results for the screening operators also provide the basis for studying the
BRST formalism of the $N$=4 superconformal algebras ${\sl {\grave a}\ la}$
Felder.
