  Migdal and Kazakov have suggested that lattice QCD with an adjoint
representation scalar in the infinite coupling limit could induce QCD.
  I find an exact saddlepoint of this theory for infinite $N$ in the case of a
quadratic scalar potential. I discuss some aspects of this solution and also
show how the continuum D=1 matrix model with an arbitrary potential can be
reproduced through this approach.
