  It is shown that the asymmetric chiral gauging of the WZW models give rise to
consistent string backgrounds. The target space structure of the ${[{SL(2,\Re)/
{SO(1,1)}}]}_L \bigotimes {[{SL(2,\Re)/U(1)}]}_R$ model is analyzed and the
presence of a hidden isometry in this background is demonstrated. A nonlinear
coordinate transformation is obtained which transforms the asymmetric model to
the symmetric one, analyzed recently by two of the present authors.
