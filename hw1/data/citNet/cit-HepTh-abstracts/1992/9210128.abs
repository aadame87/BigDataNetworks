\\
  A classical R-matrix structure is described for the Lax representation of the
integrable n-particle chains of Calogero-Olshanetski-Perelo\-mov. This R-matrix
is dynamical, non antisymmetric and non-invertible. It immediately triggers the
integrability of the Type I, II and III potentials, and the algebraic
structures associated with the Type V potential.
