  We argue that the description of meson-nucleon dynamics based on the
boson-exchange approach, is compatible with the description of the nucleon as a
soliton in the nonrelativistic limit. Our arguments are based on an analysis of
the meson-soliton form factor and the exact meson-soliton and soliton-soliton
scattering amplitudes in the Sine-Gordon model.
