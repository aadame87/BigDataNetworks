Title: Diffeomorphism group and conformal fields
Authors: T. A. Larsson
Comments: LaTex, 9 pages
\\
  Conformal fields are a new class of $Vect(N)$ modules which are more general
than tensor fields. The corresponding diffeomorphism group action is
constructed. Conformal fields are thus invariantly defined.
