  We study further the r\^ole of the boundary operator $\O_B$ for macroscopic
loop length in the stable definition of 2D quantum gravity provided by the
$[{\tilde P},Q]=Q$ formulation. The KdV flows are supplemented by an additional
flow with respect to the boundary cosmological constant $\sigma$. We
numerically study these flows for the $m=1$, $2$ and $3$ models, solving for
the string susceptibility in the presence of $\O_B$ for arbitrary coupling
$\sigma$. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the loop quantum mechanics is
continuous and bounded from below by $\sigma$. For large positive $\sigma$, the
theory is dominated by the `universal' $m=0$ topological phase present only in
the $[{\tilde P},Q]=Q$ formulation. For large negative $\sigma$, the
non--perturbative physics approaches that of the $[P,Q]=1$ definition, although
there is no path to the unstable solutions of the $[P,Q]=1$ $m$-even models.
