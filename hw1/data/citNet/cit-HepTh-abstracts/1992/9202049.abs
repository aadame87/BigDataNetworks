Title: Non-critical NSR string field theory and discrete states interaction in
  2D supergravity
Authors: I.Ya.Aref'eva and A.P.Zubarev
\\
  String field theory for the non-critical NSR string is described. In
particular it gives string field theory for the 2D super-gravity coupled to a
$\hat{c}=1$ matter field. For this purpose double-step pictures changing
operators for the non-critical NSR string are constructed. Analogues of the
critical supersymmetry transformations are written for $D<10$, they form a
closed on-shell algebra, however their action on vertices is defined only for
discrete value of the Liouville momentum. For D=2 this means that spinor
massless field has its superpartner in the NS sector only if its momentum is
fixed.
  Starting from string field theory we calculate string amplitudes. These
amplitudes for D=2 have poles which are related with discrete set of primary
fields, namely 2R$\to$2R amplitude has poles corresponding to the n-level NS
excitations with discrete momenta $p_1=n,~~p_2=-1\pm (n+1)$.
