  We propose to induce QCD by fermions in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group SU(N_c) on the lattice. We consider various types of lattice
fermions: chiral, Kogut--Susskind and Wilson ones. Using the mean field method
we show that a first order large-N phase transition occurs with decreasing
fermion mass. We conclude, therefore, that adjoint fermions induce QCD. We draw
the same conclusion for the adjoint scalar or fermion models at large number of
flavors N_f when they induce a single-plaquette lattice gauge theory. We find
an exact strong coupling solution for the adjoint fermion model and show it is
quite similar to that for the Kazakov--Migdal model with the quadratic
potential. We discuss the possibility for the adjoint fermion model to be
solvable at N_c=\infty in the weak coupling region where the Wilson loops obey
normal area law.
