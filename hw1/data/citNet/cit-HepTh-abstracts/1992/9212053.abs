Title: Double Scaling Limit of Scalar Theories on the Lattice

\\
  Scalar field theories regularized on a $D$ dimensional lattice are found to
exhibit double scaling for a class of critical behaviors labeled by an integer
$m\geq 2$. The continuum theory reached in the double scaling limit defines a
universality class and is of a massless scalar with only a $m+1$ point
self-interaction, but in the presence of a constant source. The upper critical
dimension for this to occur is the same as that for renormalizability of the
$m+1$ point interaction.
