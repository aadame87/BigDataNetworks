  We show that Witten's two-dimensional string black hole metric is exactly
conformally invariant in the supersymmetric case. We also demonstrate that this
metric, together with a recently proposed exact metric for the bosonic case,
are respectively consistent with the supersymmetric and bosonic $\sigma$-model
conformal invariance conditions up to four-loop order.
