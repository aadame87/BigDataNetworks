Title: On Paragrassmann Differential Calculus
Authors: A.T. Filippov, A.P. Isaev and A.B. Kurdikov
Comments: 19pp
Journal-ref: Theor.Math.Phys. 94 (1993) 150-165; Teor.Mat.Fiz. 94N2 (1993)

  Explicit general constructions of paragrassmann calculus with one and many
variables are given. Relations of the paragrassmann calculus to quantum groups
are outlined and possible physics applications are briefly discussed. This
paper is the same as the original 9210075 except added Appendix and minor
changes in Acknowledgements and References. IMPORTANT NOTE: This paper bears
the same title as the Dubna preprint E5-92-392 but is NOT identical to it,
containing new results, extended discussions, and references.
