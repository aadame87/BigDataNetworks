  A general method is presented for deriving on-shell Ward-identities in (2D)
string theory. It is shown that all tree-level Ward identities can be
summarized in a quadratic differential equation for the generating function of
tree-amplitudes. This result is extended to loop amplitudes and leads to a
master equation {\it \`{a} la} Batalin-Vilkovisky for the complete partition
function.
