  An $N = 1$ supersymmetric version of two dimensional dilaton gravity coupled
to matter is considered. It is shown that the linear dilaton vacuum
spontaneously breaks half the supersymmetries, leaving broken a linear
combination of left and right supersymmetries which squares to time
translations. Supersymmetry suggests a spinorial expression for the ADM energy
$M$, as found by Witten in four-dimensional general relativity. Using this
expression it is proven that ${M}$ is non-negative for smooth initial data
asymptotic (in both directions) to the linear dilaton vacuum, provided that the
(not necessarily supersymmetric) matter stress tensor obeys the dominant energy
condition. A {\it quantum} positive energy theorem is also proven for the
semiclassical large-$N$ equations, despite the indefiniteness of the quantum
stress tensor. For black hole spacetimes, it is shown that $M$ is bounded from
below by $e^{- 2 \phi_H}$, where $\phi_H$ is the value of the dilaton at the
apparent horizon, provided only that the stress tensor is positive outside the
apparent horizon. This is the two-dimensional analogue of an unproven
conjecture due to Penrose. Finally, supersymmetry is used to prove positive
energy theorems for a large class of generalizations of dilaton gravity which
arise in consideration of the quantum theory.
