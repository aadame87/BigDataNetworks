  In the light of recent blackhole solutions inspired by string theory, we
review some old statements on field theoretic hair on blackholes. We also
discuss some stability issues. In particular we argue that the two dimensional
string blackhole solution is semi-classically stable while the naked
singularity is unstable to tachyon fluctuations. Finally we comment on the
relation between the linear dilaton theory and the $2d$ blackhole solution.
