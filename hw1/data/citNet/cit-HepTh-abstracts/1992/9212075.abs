  The Liouville action for two--dimensional quantum gravity coupled to
interacting matter contains terms that have not been considered previously.
They are crucial for understanding the renormalization group flow and can be
observed in recent matrix model results for the phase diagram of the
Sine--Gordon model coupled to gravity. These terms insure, order by order in
the coupling constant, that the dressed interaction is exactly marginal. They
are discussed up to second order.
