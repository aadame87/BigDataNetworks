  Using Watson's and the recursive equations satisfied by matrix elements of
local operators in two-dimensional integrable models, we compute the form
factors of the elementary field $\phi(x)$ and the stress-energy tensor
$T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ of Sinh-Gordon theory. Form factors of operators with higher
spin or with different asymptotic behaviour can easily be deduced from them.
The value of the correlation functions are saturated by the form factors with
lowest number of particle terms. This is illustrated by an application of the
form factors of the trace of $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ to the sum rule of the
$c$-theorem.
