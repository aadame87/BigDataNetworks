  We establish a relation between the classical non-linear Schr\"odinger
equation and the KP hierarchy, and we extend this relation to the quantum case
by defining a quantum KP hierarchy. We present evidence that an integrable
hierarchy of equations is obtained by quantizing the first Hamiltonian
structure of the KdV equation. The connection between infinite-dimensional
algebras and integrable models is discussed.
