Title: On the Gupta-Bleuler Quantization of the Hamiltonian Systems with
  Anomalies
Authors: J. Kowalski-Glikman
Comments: 50 pages of plain LaTeX
Journal-ref: Annals Phys. 232 (1994) 1
\\
  As compared to the previous version, the example of Gupta-Bleuler
quantization of massive electrodynamics was added, and the derivation of path
integral for anomalous theories is further elaborated. This is the final
version to be published in Annals of Physics.
