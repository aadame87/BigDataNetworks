  We discuss time - dependent solutions of the leading order string effective
equations for a non-zero central charge deficit and curved maximally symmetric
space. Some regular solutions are found for the case of non-trivial
antisymmetric tensor and vector backgrounds (in various dimensions) and
negative spatial curvature. It remains an open question which conformal
theories are exact generalisations of these solutions.
