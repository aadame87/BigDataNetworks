Title: Extremal variety as the foundation of a cosmological quantum theory

  Dynamical systems of a new kind are described, which are motivated by the
problem of constructing diffeomorphism invariant quantum theories. These are
based on the extremization of a non-local and non-additive quantity that we
call the variety of a system. In these systems all dynaqmical variables refer
to relative coordinates or, more generally, describe relations between
particles, so that they are invariant under discrete analogues of
diffeomorphisms in which the labels of all particles are permutted arbitrarily.
The variety is a measures of how uniquely each of the elements of the system
can be distinguished from the others in terms of the values of these relative
coordinates. Thus a system with extremal variety is one in which the parts are
related to the whole in as distinct a way as possible. 
  We study numerically several dynamical systems which are defined by setting
the action of the system equal to its variety. We find evidence that suggests
that such systems may serve as the basis for a new kind of pregeometry theories
in which the geometry of low dimensional space emerges in the thermodynamic
limit from a system which is defined without the use of any background space. 
  The mathematical definition of variety may also provide a quantitative tool
to study self-organizing systems, because it distinguishes highly structured,
but asymmetric, configurations such as one finds in biological systems from
both random configurations and highly ordered configurations.
