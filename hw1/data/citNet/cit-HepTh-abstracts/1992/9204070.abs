  We describe the most general treatment of all anomalies both for chiral and
massless Dirac fermions, in two-dimensional gravity. It is shown that for this
purpose two regularization dependent parameters are present in the effective
action. Analogy to the \sc\ model is displayed corresponding to a specific
choice of the second parameter, thus showing that the gravitational model
contains \a\ relations having no analogy in the \sc\ model.
