  We calculate exactly the rate of pair production of open bosonic and
supersymmetric strings in a constant electric field. The rate agrees with
Schwinger's classic result in the weak-field limit, but diverges when the
electric field approaches some critical value of the order of the string
tension. (Phyzzx file)
