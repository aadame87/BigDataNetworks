  This paper is an expanded version of a talk given at the XIX International
Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Salamanca, July, 1992.
  We discuss the geometry of topological terms in classical actions, which by
themselves form the actions of topological field theories. We first treat the
Chern-Simons action directly. Then we explain how the geometry is best
understood via integration of smooth Deligne cocycles. We conclude with some
remarks about the corresponding quantum theories in 3 and 4 dimensions.
