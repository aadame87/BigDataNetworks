  A simple description of the KP hierarchy and its multi-hamiltonian structure
is given in terms of two Bose currents. A deformation scheme connecting various
W-infinity algebras and relation between two fundamental nonlinear structures
are discussed. Properties of Fa\'a di Bruno polynomials are extensively
explored in this construction. Applications of our method are given for the
Conformal Affine Toda model, WZNW models and discrete KP approach to Toda
lattice chain.
