  We obtain explicit expressions for the determinants of the Laplacians on zero
and one forms for an infinite class of three dimensional lens spaces $L(p,q)$.
These expressions can be combined to obtain the Ray-Singer torsion of these
lens spaces. As a consequence we obtain an infinite class of formulae for the
Riemann zeta function $\zeta(3)$. The value of these determinants (and the
torsion) grows as the size of the fundamental group of the lens space increases
and this is also computed. The triviality of the torsion for just the three
lens spaces $L(6,1)$, $L(10,3)$ and $L(12,5)$ is also noted. (postscript
