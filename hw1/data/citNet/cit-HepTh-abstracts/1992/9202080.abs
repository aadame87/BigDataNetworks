  We study the Schwinger-Dyson equations of a matrix model for an open-closed
string theory. The free energy with source terms for scaling operators
satisfies the same Virasoro conditions as those of the pure closed string and
is obtained from that of the pure closed string by giving appropriate
nonvanishing background values to all of the sources.
