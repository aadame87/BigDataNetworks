  It is a common belief among field theorists that path integrals can be
computed exactly only in a limited number of special cases, and that most of
these cases are already known. However recent developments, which generalize
the WKBJ method using equivariant cohomology, appear to contradict this folk
wisdom. At the formal level, equivariant localization would seem to allow exact
computation of phase space path integrals for an arbitrary partition function!
To see how, and if, these methods really work in practice, we have applied them
in explicit quantum mechanics examples. We show that the path integral for the
1-d hydrogen atom, which is not WKBJ exact, is localizable and computable using
the more general formalism. We find however considerable ambiguities in this
approach, which we can only partially resolve. In addition, we find a large
class of quantum mechanics examples where the localization procedure breaks
down completely.
