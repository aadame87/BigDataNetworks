  In this paper it is shown that a quantum observable algebra, the
Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, is just given as the Hopf algebraic dual to the
classical observable algebra over classical phase space and the Plank constant
is included in this scheme of quantization as a compatible parameter living in
the quantum double theory.In this sense,the quantum Yang-Baxter equation
naturally appears as a necessary condition to be satisfied by a canonical
elements,the universal R-matrix,intertweening the quantum and classical
observable algebras. As a byproduct,a new ``quantum group'' is obtained as the
quantum double of the classical observable algebra
