Title: Problems of Naturalness: Some Lessons from String Theory

  We consider some questions of naturalness which arise when one considers
conventional field theories in the presence of gravitation: the problem of
global symmetries, the strong CP problem, and the cosmological constant
problem. Using string theory as a model, we argue that it is reasonable to
postulate weakly broken global discrete symmetries. We review the arguments
that gravity is likely to spoil the Peccei-Quinn solution of the strong CP
problem, and update earlier analyses showing that discrete symmetries can lead
to axions with suitable properties. Even if there are not suitable axions, we
note that string theory is a theory in which CP is spontaneously broken and
$\theta$ in principle calculable. $\theta$ thus might turn out to be small
along lines suggested some time ago by Nelson and by Barr.
