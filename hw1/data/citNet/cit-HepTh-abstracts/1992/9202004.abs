  Particle scattering and radiation by a magnetically charged, dilatonic black
hole is investigated near the extremal limit at which the mass is a constant
times the charge. Near this limit a neighborhood of the horizon of the black
hole is closely approximated by a trivial product of a two-dimensional black
hole with a sphere. This is shown to imply that the scattering of
long-wavelength particles can be described by a (previously analyzed)
two-dimensional effective field theory, and is related to the
formation/evaporation of two-dimensional black holes. The scattering proceeds
via particle capture followed by Hawking re-emission, and naively appears to
violate unitarity. However this conclusion can be altered when the effects of
backreaction are included. Particle-hole scattering is discussed in the light
of a recent analysis of the two-dimensional backreaction problem. It is argued
that the quantum mechanical possibility of scattering off of extremal black
holes implies the potential existence of additional quantum numbers - referred
to as ``quantum whiskers'' - characterizing the black hole.
