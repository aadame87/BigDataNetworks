  We show that the isometries of the manifold of scalars in $N=2$ supergravity
in $d=5$ space-time dimensions can be broken by the supergravity interactions.
The opposite conclusion holds for the dimensionally reduced $d=4$ theories,
where the isometries of the scalar manifold are always symmetries of the full
theory. These spaces, which form a subclass of the {\em special} K\"ahler
manifolds, are relevant for superstring compactifications.
