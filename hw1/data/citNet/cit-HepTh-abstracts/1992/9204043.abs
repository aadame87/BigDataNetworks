  We study the twisted version of the supersymmetric
$G/T=SU(n)/U(1)^{\otimes(n-1)} gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. By studying its
fixed points under BRST transformation this model is shown to be reduced to a
simple topological field theory, that is, the topological matter system in the
K.Li's theory of 2 dimensional gravity for the case of $n=2$, and its
generalization for $n \geq 3$.
