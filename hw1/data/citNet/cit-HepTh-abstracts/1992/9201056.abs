  A careful treatment of closed string BRST cohomology shows that there are
more discrete states and associated symmetries in $D=2$ string theory than has
been recognized hitherto. The full structure, at the $SU(2)$ radius, has a
natural description in terms of abelian gauge theory on a certain three
dimensional cone $Q$. We describe precisely how symmetry currents are
constructed from the discrete states, explaining the role of the ``descent
equations.'' In the uncompactified theory, we compute the action of the
symmetries on the tachyon field, and isolate the features that lead to
nonlinear terms in this action. The resulting symmetry structure is interpreted
in terms of a homotopy Lie algebra.
