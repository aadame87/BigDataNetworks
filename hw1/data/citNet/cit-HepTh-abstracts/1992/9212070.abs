  We derive the discrete linear systems associated to multi--matrix models, the
corresponding discrete hierarchies and the appropriate coupling conditions. We
also obtain the $W_{1+\infty}$ constraints on the partition function. We then
apply to multi--matrix models the technique, developed in previous papers, of
extracting hierarchies of differential equations from lattice ones without
passing through a continuum limit. In a q--matrix model we find 2q coupled
differential systems. The corresponding differential hierarchies are particular
versions of the KP hierarchy. We show that the multi--matrix partition function
is a $\tau$--function of these hierarchies. We discuss a few examples in the
dispersionless limit.
