  We derive the explicit form of the Wess-Zumino quantum effective action of
chiral $\, \Winf$-symmetric system of matter fields coupled to a general chiral
$\, \Winf$-gravity background. It is expressed as a geometric action on a
coadjoint orbit of the deformed group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms on
cylinder whose underlying Lie algebra is the centrally-extended algebra of
symbols of differential operators on the circle. Also, we present a systematic
derivation , in terms of symbols, of the ``hidden" $SL (\infty ; \IR )$
Kac-Moody currents and the associated $SL (\infty ; \IR )$ Sugawara form of
energy-momentum tensor component $T_{++}$ as a consequence of the $SL (\infty ;
\IR )$ stationary subgroup of the relevant $\, \Winf$ coadjoint orbit.
