Title: Quantum group gauge theory on quantum spaces
Authors: Tomasz Brzezinski and Shahn Majid
Comments: 65 pages DAMTP/92-27 Revised to emphasise more the U(1) monopole
  example -- includes now full details in the 3D differential calculus

  We construct quantum group-valued canonical connections on quantum
homogeneous spaces, including a q-deformed Dirac monopole on the quantum sphere
of Podles quantum differential coming from the 3-D calculus of Woronowicz on
$SU_q(2)$ . The construction is presented within the setting of a general
theory of quantum principal bundles with quantum group (Hopf algebra) fiber,
associated quantum vector bundles and connection one-forms. Both the base space
(spacetime) and the total space are non-commutative algebras (quantum spaces).
