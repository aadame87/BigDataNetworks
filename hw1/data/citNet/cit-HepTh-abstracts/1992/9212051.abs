  We can recast the Yang-Baxter equation as a triple product equation. Assuming
the triple product to satisfy some algebraic relations, we can find new
solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. This program has been completed here for
the simplest triple systems which we call octonionic and quaternionic. The
solutions are of rational type.
