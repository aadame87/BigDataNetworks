\\
  A twistor correspondence for the self-duality equations for supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories is developed. Their solutions are shown to be encoded in
analytic harmonic superfields satisfying appropriate generalised Cauchy-Riemann
conditions. An action principle yielding these conditions is presented.
