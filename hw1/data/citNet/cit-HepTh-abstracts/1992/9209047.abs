  Exact and explicit string solutions in de Sitter spacetime are found. (Here,
the string equations reduce to a sinh-Gordon model). A new feature without flat
spacetime analogy appears: starting with a single world-sheet, several (here
two) strings emerge. One string is stable and the other (unstable) grows as the
universe grows. Their invariant size and energy either grow as the expansion
factor or tend to constant. Moreover, strings can expand (contract) for large
(small) universe radius with a different rate than the universe.
