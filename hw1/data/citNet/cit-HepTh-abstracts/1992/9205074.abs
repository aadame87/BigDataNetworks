  In these lectures the relations between symmetries, Lie algebras, Killing
vectors and Noether's theorem are reviewed. A generalisation of the basic ideas
to include velocity-dependend co-ordinate transformations naturally leads to
the concept of Killing tensors. Via their Poisson brackets these tensors
generate an {\em a priori} infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. The nature of such
infinite algebras is clarified using the example of flat space-time. Next the
formalism is extended to spinning space, which in addition to the standard real
co-ordinates is parametrized also by Grassmann-valued vector variables. The
equations for extremal trajectories (`geodesics') of these spaces describe the
pseudo-classical mechanics of a Dirac fermion. We apply the formalism to solve
for the motion of a pseudo-classical electron in Schwarzschild space-time.
