  We consider the solutions of the field equations for the large $N$ dilaton
gravity model in $1+1$ dimensions recently proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey
and Strominger (CGHS). We find time dependant solutions with finite mass and
vanishing flux in the weak coupling regime, as well as solutions which lie
entirely in the Liouville region.
