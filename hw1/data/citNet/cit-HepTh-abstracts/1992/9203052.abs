  Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger have proposed an interesting two
dimensional model theory that allows one to consider black hole evaporation in
the semi-classical approximation. They originally hoped the black hole would
evaporate completely without a singularity. However, it has been shown that the
semi-classical equations will give a singularity where the dilaton field
reaches a certain critical value. Initially, it seems this singularity will be
hidden inside a black hole. However, as the evaporation proceeds, the dilaton
field on the horizon will approach the critical value but the temperature and
rate of emission will remain finite. These results indicate either that there
is a naked singularity, or (more likely) that the semi-classical approximation
breaks down when the dilaton field approaches the critical value.
