Title: On Physical States in c<1 String Theory
Authors: S. Govindarajan

  The BRST cohomology analysis of Lian and Zuckerman leads to physical states
at all ghost number for $c<1$ matter coupled to Liouville gravity. We show how
these states are related to states at ghost numbers zero(pure vertex operator
states -- DK states) and ghost number one(ring elements) by means of descent
equations. These descent equations follow from the double cohomology of the
String BRST and Felder BRST operators. We briefly discuss how the ring elements
allow one to determine all correlation functions on the sphere.
