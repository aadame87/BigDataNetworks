  Matter is coupled to three-dimensional gravity such that the topological
phase is allowed and the (anti-) de Sitter or Poincar\'e symmetry remains
intact. Spontaneous symmetry breaking to the Lorentz group occurs if a scalar
field is included. This Higgs field can then be used to couple matter so that
the familiar form of the matter coupling is established in the broken phase. We
also give the supersymmetrization of this construction.
