  We propose a naive unification of Electromagnetism and General Relativity
based on enlarging the gauge group of Ashtekar's new variables. We construct
the connection and loop representations and analyze the space of states. In the
loop representation, the wavefunctions depend on two loops, each of them
carrying information about both gravitation and electromagnetism. We find that
the Chern-Simons form and the Jones Polynomial play a role in the model.
