  The self-duality equations for the Riemann tensor are studied using the
Ashtekar Hamiltonian formulation for general relativity. These equations may be
written as dynamical equations for three divergence free vector fields on a
three dimensional surface in the spacetime. A simplified form of these
equations, describing metrics with a one Killing field symmetry are written
down, and it shown that a particular sector of these equations has a
Hamiltonian form where the Hamiltonian is an arbitrary function on a
two-surface. In particular, any element of the $w_\infty$ algebra may be chosen
as a the Hamiltonian.  For a special choice of this Hamiltonian, an infinite
set of solutions of the self-duality equations are given. These solutions are
parametrized by elements of the $w_\infty$ algebra, which in turn leads to an
explicit form of four dimensional complex self-dual metrics that are in one to
one correspondence with elements of this algebra.
