  Non-extreme walls (bubbles with two insides) and ultra-extreme walls (bubbles
of false vacuum decay) are discussed. Their respective energy densities are
higher and lower than that of the corresponding extreme (supersymmetric),
planar domain wall. These singularity free space-times exhibit non-trivial
causal structure analogous to certain non-extreme black holes. We focus on
anti-de~Sitter--Minkowski walls and comment on Minkowski--Minkowski walls with
trivial extreme limit, as well as walls adjacent to de~Sitter space-times with
no extreme limit.
