  The three-point functions for minimal models coupled to gravity are derived
in the operator approach to Liouville theory which is based on its $U_q(sl(2))$
quantum group structure. The result is shown to agree with matrix-model
calculations on the sphere. The precise definition of the corresponding
cosmological constant is given in the operator solution of the quantum
Liouville theory. It is shown that the symmetry between quantum-group spins $J$
and $-J-1$ previously put forward by the author is the explanation of the
continuation in the number of screening operators discovered by Goulian and Li.
Contrary to the previous discussions of this problem, the present approach
clearly separates the emission operators for each leg. This clarifies the
structure of the dressing by gravity. It is shown, in particular that the end
points are not treated on the same footing as the mid point. Since the outcome
is completely symmetric this suggests the existence of a picture-changing
mechanism in two dimensional gravity.
