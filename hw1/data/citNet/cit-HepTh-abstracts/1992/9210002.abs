  The $Z_N$-invariant chiral Potts model is considered as a perturbation of a
$Z_N$ conformal field theory. In the self-dual case the renormalization group
equations become simple, and yield critical exponents and anisotropic scaling
which agree with exact results for the super-integrable lattice models.
Although the continuum theory is not Lorentz invariant, it respects a novel
type of space-time symmetry which allows for the observed spontaneous breaking
of translational symmetry in the ground state. The continuum theory is shown to
possess an infinite number of conserved charges on the self-dual line, which
remain conserved when the theory is perturbed by the energy operator.
