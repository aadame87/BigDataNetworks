  We construct a four-parameter point-interaction for a non-relativistic
particle moving on a line as the limit of a short range interaction with range
tending toward zero. For particular choices of the parameters, we can obtain a
delta-interaction or the so-called delta'-interaction. The Hamiltonian
corresponding to the four-parameter point-interaction is shown to correspond to
the four-parameter self-adjoint Hamiltonian of the free particle moving on the
line with the origin excluded.
