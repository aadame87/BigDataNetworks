  We study the correspondence between the linear matrix model and the
interacting nonlinear string theory. Starting from the simple matrix harmonic
oscillator states, we derive in a direct way scattering amplitudes of
2-dimensional strings, exhibiting the nonlinear equation generating arbitrary
N-point tree amplitudes. An even closer connection between the matrix model and
the conformal string theory is seen in studies of the symmetry algebra of the
system.
