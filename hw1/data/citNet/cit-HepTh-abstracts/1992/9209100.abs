  The double scaling limit of a new class of the multi-matrix models proposed
in \cite{MMM91}, which possess the $W$-symmetry at the discrete level, is
investigated in details. These models are demonstrated to fall into the same
universality class as the standard multi-matrix models. In particular, the
transformation of the W-algebra at the discrete level into the continuum one of
the paper \cite{FKN91a} is proposed, the corresponding partition functions
being compared. All calculations are demonstrated in full in the first
non-trivial case of $W^{(3)}$-constraints.
