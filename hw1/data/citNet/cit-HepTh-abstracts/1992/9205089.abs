Title: Liouville Models of Black Hole Evaporation
Authors: Adel Bilal and Curtis Callan
Comments: 27 pages, revised ("Note Added" is expanded to show how careful
  treatment of quantum effects makes the Hawking radiation rate proportional to
  N/12 rather than (N-24)/12 and also to show that the cosmic censorship
  mechanism proposed by Russo et.al. for a somewhat different model works for
  our model as well. New references are added and the preprint number is
  corrected.) PUPT-1320

  We construct new theories of dilation gravity coupled to conformal matter
which are exact $c=26$ conformal field theories and presumably consistent
frameworks for discussing black hole physics in two dimensions. They differ
from the CGHS equations in the precise dilaton dependence of the cosmological
constant. A further modification proposed by Strominger with a view to
eliminating unphysical ghost Hawking radiation is also considered. The new
classical equations of motion are explicitly soluble, thus permitting an exact
analysis of both static and dynamic senarios. While the static solutions are
physically reasonable, the dynamical solutions include puzzling examples with
wrong-sign Hawking radiation. We indicate how the latter problem may be
resolved in the full quantum theory.
