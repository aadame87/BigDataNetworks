  Extremal black holes are studied in a two dimensional model motivated by a
dimensional reduction from four dimensions. Their quantum corrected geometry is
calculated semiclassically and a mild singularity is shown to appear at the
horizon.
  Extensions of the geometry past the horizon are not unique but there are
continuations free from malevolent singularities. A few comments are made about
the relevance of these results to four dimensions and to the study of black
hole entropy and information loss.
