  A classification of ordinary differential equations and finite-difference
equations in one variable having polynomial solutions (the generalized Bochner
problem) is given. The method used is based on the spectral problem for a
polynomial element of the universal enveloping algebra of $sl_2({\bf R})$ (for
differential equations) or $sl_2({\bf R})_q$ (for finite-difference equations)
in the "projectivized" representation possessing an invariant subspace.
Connection to the recently-discovered quasi-exactly-solvable problems is
discussed.
