Title: A Comment on the Relationship Between Differential and Dimensional
  Renormalization

  We show that there is a very simple relationship between differential and
dimensional renormalization of low-order Feynman graphs in renormalizable
massless quantum field theories. The beauty of the differential approach is
that it achieves the same finite results as dimensional renormalization without
the need to modify the space time dimension.
