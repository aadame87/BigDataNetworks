  The non-relativistic quantum field theoretic lagrangian which describes an
anyon system in the presence of an electromagnetic field is identified. A
non-minimal magnetic coupling to the Chern-Simons statistical field as well as
to the electromagnetic field together with a direct coupling between between
both fields are the non-trivial ingredients of the lagrangian obtained from the
non-relativistic limit of the fermionic relativistic formulation. The results,
an electromagnetic gyromagnetic ratio 2 for any spin together with a
non-trivial dynamical spin dependent contact interaction between anyons as well
as the spin dependence of the electromagnetic effective action, agree with the
quantum mechanical formulation.
