  In this paper we consider extensions of the super Virasoro algebra by one and
two super primary fields. Using a non-explicitly covariant approach we compute
all SW-algebras with one generator of dimension up to 7 in addition to the
super Virasoro field. In complete analogy to W-algebras with two generators
most results can be classified using the representation theory of the super
Virasoro algebra. Furthermore, we find that the SW(3/2, 11/2)-algebra can be
realized as a subalgebra of SW(3/2, 5/2) at c = 10/7. We also construct some
new SW-algebras with three generators, namely SW(3/2, 3/2, 5/2), SW(3/2, 2, 2)
and SW(3/2, 2, 5/2).
