  Colored Graphs

  We present formulas for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the Racah
coefficients for the root of unity representations ($N$-dimensional
representations with $q^{2N}=1$) of $U_q(sl(2))$. We discuss colored vertex
models and colored IRF (Interaction Round a Face) models from the color
representations of $U_q(sl(2))$. We construct invariants of trivalent colored
oriented framed graphs from color representations of $U_q(sl(2))$.
