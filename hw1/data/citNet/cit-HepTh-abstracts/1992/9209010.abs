  We study the discrete state structure of $\hat c=1$ superconformal matter
coupled to 2-D supergravity. Factorization properties of scattering amplitudes
are used to identify these states and to construct the corresponding vertex
operators. For both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors these states are shown to
be organized in
  SU(2) multiplets. The algebra generated by the discrete states is computed in
the limit of null cosmological constant.
