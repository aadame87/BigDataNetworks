  Closed string field theory leads to a generalization of Lie algebra which
arose naturally within mathematics in the study of deformations of algebraic
structures. It also appeared in work on higher spin particles \cite{BBvD}.
Representation theoretic analogs arose in the mathematical analysis of the
Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach to constrained Hamiltonians. A major goal
of this paper is to see the relevant formulas, especially in closed string
field theory, as a generalization of those for a differential graded Lie
algebra, hopefully describing the mathematical essentials in terms accessible
to {\it physicists}.
