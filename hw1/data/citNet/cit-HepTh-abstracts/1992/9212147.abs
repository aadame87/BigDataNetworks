  Quantum mechanical potentials satisfying the property of shape invariance are
well known to be algebraically solvable. Using a scaling ansatz for the change
of parameters, we obtain a large class of new shape invariant potentials which
are reflectionless and possess an infinite number of bound states. They can be
viewed as q-deformations of the single soliton solution corresponding to the
Rosen-Morse potential. Explicit expressions for energy eigenvalues,
eigenfunctions and transmission coefficients are given. Included in our
potentials as a special case is the self-similar potential recently discussed
by Shabat and Spiridonov.
