Title: Physical States in the $W_3$ String
Authors: C.N. Pope
Comments: 14 pages
\\
  We present a review of some of the recent developments in the study of the
$W_3$ string. One of the interesting features of the theory is that the
physical spectrum includes states with non-standard ghost structure, such as
excitations of the ghost fields, both for discrete-momentum and
continuous-momentum states. (Contribution to the Proceedings of the 16'th Johns
Hopkins Workshop on Current Problems in Particle Physics, Gothenburg, Sweden,
