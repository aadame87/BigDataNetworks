Title: Einstein Gravity in 2+1 Dimensions from a Gauge Model with Symmetry
  Breaking
Authors: R. Brooks, D. Cangemi and M. Crescimanno
Comments: 10 pages, MIT preprint CTP#2129
\\
  Einstein Gravity in 2+1 dimensions arises as a consequence of the equations
of motion of a gauge model in an external metric. Newton's constant appears as
an order parameter of a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. Matter is
coupled in a straightforward way.
