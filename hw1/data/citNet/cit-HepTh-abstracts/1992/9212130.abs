  D-dimensional constrained systems are studied with stochastic Lagrangian
and\break Hamiltonian. It is shown that stochastic consistency conditions are
second class constraints and Lagrange multiplier fields can be determined in
(D+1)-dimensional canonical formulation. The Langevin equations for the
constrained system are obtained as Hamilton's equations of motion where
conjugate momenta play a part of noise fields.
