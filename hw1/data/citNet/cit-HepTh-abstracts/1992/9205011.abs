  We argue that \CP is a gauge symmetry in string theory. As a consequence, \CP
cannot be explicitly broken either perturbatively or non-pertubatively; there
can be no non-perturbative \CP-violating parameters. String theory is thus an
example of a theory where all $\theta$ angles arise due to spontaneous \CP
violation, and are in principle calculable.
