  We show that that the Jacobi-identities for a W-algebra with primary fields
of dimensions 3, 4 and 5 allow two different solutions. The first solution can
be identified with WA_4. The second is special in the sense that, even though
associative for general value of the central charge, null-fields appear that
violate some of the Jacobi-identities, a fact that is usually linked to
exceptional W-algebras. In contrast we find for the algebra that has an
additional spin 6 field only the solution WA_5.
