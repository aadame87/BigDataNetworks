  We discuss in this paper various aspects of the off-critical $O(n)$ model in
two dimensions. We find the ground-state energy conjectured by Zamolodchikov
for the unitary minimal models, and extend the result to some non-unitary
minimal cases. We apply our results to the discussion of scaling functions for
polymers on a cylinder. We show, using the underlying N=2 supersymmetry, that
the scaling function for one non-contractible polymer loop around the cylinder
is simply related to the solution of the Painleve III differential equation. We
also find the ground-state energy for a single polymer on the cylinder. We
check these results by numerically simulating the polymer system. We also
analyze numerically the flow to the dense polymer phase. We find there
surprising results, with a $c_{\hbox{eff}}$ function that is not monotonous and
seems to have a roaming behavior, getting very close to the values 81/70 and
7/10 between its UV and IR values of 1.
