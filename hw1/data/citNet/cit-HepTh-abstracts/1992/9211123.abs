  By consireding representation theory for non-associative algebras we
construct the fundamental and adjoint representations of the octonion algebra.
We then show how these representations by associative matrices allow a
consistent octonionic gauge theory to be realised. We find that
non-associativity implies the existence of new terms in the transformation laws
of fields and the kinetic term of an octonionic Lagrangian.
