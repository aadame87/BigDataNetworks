  We consider gravity in 2+1 dimensions in presence of extended stationary
sources with rotational symmetry. We prove by direct use of Einstein's
equations that if i) the energy momentum tensor satisfies the weak energy
condition, ii) the universe is open (conical at space infinity), iii) there are
no CTC at space infinity, then there are no CTC at all.
