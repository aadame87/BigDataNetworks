  The integrability of $R^2$-gravity with torsion in two dimensions is traced
to an ultralocal dynamical symmetry of constraints and momenta in Hamiltonian
phase space. It may be interpreted as a quadratically deformed
$iso(2,1)$-algebra with the deformation consisting of the Casimir operators of
the undeformed algebra. The locally conserved quantity encountered in the
explicit solution is identified as an element of the centre of this algebra.
Specific contractions of the algebra are related to specific limits of the
explicit solutions of this model.
