Title: Lift of dilogarithm to partition identities
Authors: Michael Terhoeven
Comments: 9 pages, preprint BONN-HE-92-36, (a few typos were corrected, also I
  tried get rid of some of the notorious degeneracies of the type p=p'=m=r=s
  and n=n+/-1)

  For the whole set of dilogarithm identities found recently using the
thermodynamic Bethe-Ansatz for the $ADET$ series of purely elastic scattering
theories we give partition identities which involve characters of those
conformal field theories which correspond to the UV-limits of the scattering
theories. These partition identities in turn allow to derive the dilogarithm
identities using modular invariance and a saddle point approximation. We
conjecture on possible generalizations of this correspondance, namely, a lift
from dilogarithm to partition identities.
