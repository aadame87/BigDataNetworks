  We consider correlation functions in Neveu--Schwarz string theory coupled to
two dimensional gravity. The action for the 2D gravity consists of the string
induced Liouville action and the Jackiw--Teitelboim action describing pure 2D
gravity. Then gravitational dressed dimensions of vertex operators are equal to
their bare conformal dimensions. There are two possible interpretations of the
model. Considering the 2D dilaton and the Liouville field as additional target
space coordinates one gets a $d+2$-dimensional critical string. In the
$d$-dimensional non critical string picture gravitational fields retain their
original meaning and for $d=4$ one can get a mass spectrum via consistency
requirements. In both cases a GSO projection is possible.
