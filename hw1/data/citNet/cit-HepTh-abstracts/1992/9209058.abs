Title: Do Black Holes Destroy Information?
Authors: John Preskill
Comments: 18 pages, harvmac, CALT-68-1819
\\
  I review the information loss paradox that was first formulated by Hawking,
and discuss possible ways of resolving it. All proposed solutions have serious
drawbacks. I conclude that the information loss paradox may well presage a
revolution in fundamental physics. (To appear in the proceedings of the
International Symposium on Black Holes,
  Membranes, Wormholes, and Superstrings.)
