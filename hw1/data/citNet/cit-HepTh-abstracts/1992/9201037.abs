  We generalize the Marinari-Parisi definition for pure two dimensional quantum
gravity $(k = 2)$ to all non unitary minimal multicritical points $(k \geq 3)$.
The resulting interacting Fermi gas theory is treated in the collective field
framework. Making use of the fact that the matrices evolve in Langevin time,
the Jacobian from matrix coordinates to collective modes is similar to the
corresponding Jacobian in $d = 1$ matrix models. The collective field theory is
analyzed in the planar limit. The saddle point eigenvalue distribution is the
one that defines the original multicritical point and therefore exhibits the
appropriate scaling behaviour. Some comments on the nonperturbative properties
of the collective field theory as well as comments on the Virasoro constraints
associated with the loop equations are made at the end of this letter. There we
also make some remarks on the fermionic formulation of the model and its
integrability, as a nonlocal version of the non linear Schr\"{o}dinger model.
