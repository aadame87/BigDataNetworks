Title: Virasoro Representations on (Diff S1)/S1 Coadjoint Orbits
Authors: Washington Taylor IV
Comments: 36 pages
\\
  A new set of realizations of the Virasoro algebra on a bosonic Fock space are
found by explicitly computing the Virasoro representations associated with
coadjoint orbits of the form (Diff S1) / S1. Some progress is made in
understanding the unitary structure of these representations. The characters of
these representations are exactly the bosonic partition functions calculated
previously by Witten using perturbative and fixed-point methods. The
representations corresponding to the discrete series of unitary Virasoro
representations with c <= 1 are found to be reducible in this formulation,
confirming a conjecture by Aldaya and Navarro-Salas.
