  Continuum Virasoro constraints in the two-cut hermitian matrix models are
derived from the discrete Ward identities by means of the mapping from the
$GL(\infty )$ Toda hierarchy to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) hierarchy.
The invariance of the string equation under the NLS flows is worked out. Also
the quantization of the integration constant $\alpha$ reported by Hollowood et
al. is explained by the analyticity of the continuum limit.
