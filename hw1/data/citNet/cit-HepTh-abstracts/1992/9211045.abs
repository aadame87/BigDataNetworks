  The free Maxwell field theory is quantized in the Lorentz gauge on a two
dimensional manifold $M$ with conformally flat background metric. It is shown
that in this gauge the theory is equivalent, at least at the classical level,
to a biharmonic version of the bosonic string theory. This equivalence is
exploited in order to construct in details the propagator of the Maxwell field
theory on $M$. The expectation values of the Wilson loops are computed. A
trivial result is obtained confirming in the Lorentz gauge previous
calculations. Finally the interacting case is briefly discussed taking the
Schwinger model as an example. The two and three point functions of the
Schwinger model are explicitly derived at the lowest order on a Riemann
surface.
