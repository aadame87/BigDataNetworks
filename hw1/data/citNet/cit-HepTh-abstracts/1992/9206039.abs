  We study the nonrelativistic limit of the $N=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons
matter system. We show that in addition to Galilean invariance the model admits
a set of symmetries generated by fermionic charges, which can be interpreted as
an {\it extended Galilean supersymmetry }. The system also possesses a hidden
conformal invariance and then the full group of symmetries is the {\it extended
superconformal Galilean} group. We also show that imposing extended
superconformal Galilean symmetry determines the values of the coupling
constants in such a way that their values in the bosonic sector agree with the
values of Jackiw and Pi for which self-dual equation exist. We finally analyze
the second quantized version of the model and the two-particle sector.
