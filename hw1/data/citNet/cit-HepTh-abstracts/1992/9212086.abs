  We use Hirota's method formulated as a recursive scheme to construct complete
set of soliton solutions for the affine Toda field theory based on an arbitrary
Lie algebra. Our solutions include a new class of solitons connected with two
different type of degeneracies encountered in the Hirota's perturbation
approach. We also derive an universal mass formula for all Hirota's solutions
to the Affine Toda model valid for all underlying Lie groups. Embedding of the
Affine Toda model in the Conformal Affine Toda model plays a crucial role in
this analysis.
