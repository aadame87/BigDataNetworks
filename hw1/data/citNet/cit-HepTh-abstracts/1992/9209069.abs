  A topological quantum field theory of non-abelian differential forms is
investigated from the point of view of its possible applications to description
of polynomial invariants of higher-dimensional two-component links. A
path-integral representation of the partition function of the theory, which is
a highly on-shell reducible system, is obtained in the framework of the
antibracket-antifield formalism of Batalin and Vilkovisky. The quasi-monodromy
matrix, giving rise to corresponding skein relations, is formally derived in a
manifestly covariant non-perturbative manner.
