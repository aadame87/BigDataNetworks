  In the physical interpretation of states in non-perturbative loop quantum
gravity the so-called weave states play an important role. Until now only
weaves representing flat geometries have been introduced explicitly. In this
paper the construction of weaves for non-flat geometries is described; in
particular, weaves representing the Schwarzschild solution are constructed.
