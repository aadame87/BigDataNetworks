  We propose a Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) for G_k x G_l / G_{k+l}
conformal coset models (G any simply-laced Lie algebra) perturbed by their
operator \phi_{1,1,Adj}. An interesting adjacency structure appears and can be
depicted in a sort of ``product'' of Dynkin diagrams of G and A_{k+l-1}. UV and
IR limits are computed and reproduce the expected values for the central
charges. For k->\infty, l fixed we obtain the TBA of the G_l WZW model
perturbed by J_a\bar{J}_a, and for k,l->\infty, k-l fixed, that of Principal
Chiral model with WZ term at level k-l.
