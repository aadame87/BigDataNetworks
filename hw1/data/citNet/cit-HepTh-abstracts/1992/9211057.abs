  A suggestion on how black holes may appear in Das-Jevicki Collective field
theory is given. We study the behaviour of a `test' particle when energy is
sent into the system. A perturbation moving near the potential barrier can
create a large-distance black hole geometry where the seeming curvature
singularity is at the position of the barrier. In the simplest `static' case
the exact $D=2$ black hole metric emerges.
