  We carry on the study of the Alexander Conway invariant from the
quantum field  theory point of view started in \cite{RS91}.
  We first discuss in details $S$ and $T$ matrices for the $U(1,1)$ super
WZW model and obtain, for the level $k$ an integer, new finite dimensional
representations of the modular group. These have the remarkable property
that some of the $S$ matrix elements are infinite. Moreover, typical
and  atypical representations as well as indecomposable blocks are mixed:
truncation to maximally atypical representations, as advocated  in some recent
papers, is not consistent.
  The main topological application of this work is the computation of Alexander
invariants for 3-manifolds and for links in 3-manifolds. Invariants of
3-manifolds seem to depend trivially on the level $k$, but still contain
interesting topological information. For Seifert manifolds for instance,
they  coincide with the order  of the first homology group. Examples of
invariants of links in 3-manifolds are given. They exhibit interesting
arithmetic properties.
