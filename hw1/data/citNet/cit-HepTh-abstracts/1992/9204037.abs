  The three point correlation functions with twist fields are determined for
bosonic $Z_N$ orbifolds. Both the choice of the modular background (compatible
with the twist) and of the (higher) twisted sectors involved are fully general.
We point out a necessary restriction on the set of instantons contributing to
twist field correlation functions not obtained in previous calculations. Our
results show that the theory is target space duality invariant.
