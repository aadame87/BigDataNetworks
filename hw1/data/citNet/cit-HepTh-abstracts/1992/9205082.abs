  A previously proposed two-step algorithm for calculating the expectation
values of Chern-Simons graphs fails to determine certain crucial signs. The
step which involves calculating tetrahedra by solving certain non- linear
equations is repaired by introducing additional linear equations. As a first
step towards a new algorithm for general graphs we find useful linear equations
for those special graphs which support knots and links. Using the improved set
of equations for tetrahedra we examine the symmetries between tetrahedra
generated by arbitrary simple currents. Along the way we uncover the classical
origin of simple-current charges. The improved skein relations also lead to
exact identities between planar tetrahedra in level $K$ $G(N)$ and level $N$
$G(K)$ CS theories, where $G(N)$ denotes a classical group. These results are
recast as identities for quantum $6j$-symbols and WZW braid matrices. We obtain
the transformation properties of arbitrary graphs and links under simple
current symmetries and rank-level duality. For links with knotted components
this requires precise control of the braid eigenvalue permutation signs, which
we obtain from plethysm and an explicit expression for the (multiplicity free)
signs, valid for all compact gauge groups and all fusion products.
