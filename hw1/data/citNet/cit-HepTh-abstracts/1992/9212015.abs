Title: Spectra of Conformal Turbulence

\\
  A set of different conformal solutions corresponding to a constant flux of
squared vorticity is considered. Requiring constant fluxes of all inviscid
vorticity invariants (higher powers of the vorticity), we come to the
conclusion that the general turbulence spectrum should be given by Kraichnan's
expression $E(k)\propto k\sp{-3}$. This spectrum, in particular, can be
obtained as a limit of some subsequences of the conformal solutions.
