  We present the Green-Schwarz $\s\-$model coupled to the $N=1$ {\it
{supersymmetric}} Yang-Mills and supergravity in a four-dimensional space-time
with the indefinite signature $(+,+,-,-)$. We first confirm the
$\k\-$invariance of the Green-Schwarz action, and show that all the
$\b\-$functions for the backgrounds vanish consistently after the use of their
superfield equations. Subsequently, we inspect the supersymmetric {\it
self-duality} conditions, that have been developed in our previous paper on the
Yang-Mills and supergravity backgrounds. Remarkably, the Majorana-Weyl spinor
dictating the {\it supersymmetric self-duality} conditions is consistent with
the couplings of Green-Schwarz superstring. Such Green-Schwarz superstring is
supposed to be the underlying theory of the {\it supersymmetric self-dual}
Yang-Mills theory, which is conjectured to generate {\it all} exactly soluble
supersymmetric systems in lower dimensions.
