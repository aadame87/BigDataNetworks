  It is shown that the Dirac operator in the background of a magnetic
%Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and a Euclidean vortex possesses normalizable
zero modes in theories containing superconducting cosmic strings. One
consequence of these zero modes is the presence of a fermion condensate around
magnetically charged black holes which violates global quantum numbers.
