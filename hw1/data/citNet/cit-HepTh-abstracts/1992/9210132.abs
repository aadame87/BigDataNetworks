  This paper reviews the covariant formalism of N=1, D=10 classical
superparticle models. It discusses the local invariances of a number of
superparticle actions and highlights the problem of finding a covariant
quantization scenario. Covariant quantization has proved problematic, but it
has motivated in seeking alternative approaches that avoids those found in
earlier models. It also shows new covariant superparticle theories formulated
in extended spaces that preserve certain canonical form in phase-space, and
easy to quantize by using the Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure, as the gauge
algebra of their constraints only closes on-shell. The mechanics actions
describe particles moving in a superspace consisting of the usual $N=1$
superspace, together with an extra spinor or vector coordinate. A light-cone
analysis shows that all these new superparticle models reproduce the physical
spectrum of the N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory.
