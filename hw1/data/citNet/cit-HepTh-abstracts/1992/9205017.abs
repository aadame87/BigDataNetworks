Title: c = 1 conformal field theory and the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Christopher Ting and C. H. Lai
Comments: (10 pages)
\\
  We examine the application of $c=1$ conformal field theory to the description
of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). It is found that the Gaussian
model together with an appropriate boundary condition for the order parameter
furnishes an effective theory for the Laughlin type FQHE. The plateau formation
condition corresponds to taking the {\em chiral} portion of the theory.
