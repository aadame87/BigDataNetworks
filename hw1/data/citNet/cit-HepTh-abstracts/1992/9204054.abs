  The 1D Heisenberg spin chain with anisotropy of the XXZ type is analyzed in
terms of the symmetry given by the quantum Galilei group Gamma_q(1). We show
that the magnon excitations and the s=1/2, n-magnon bound states are determined
by the algebra. Thus the Gamma_q(1) symmetry provides a description that
naturally induces the Bethe Ansatz. The recurrence relations determined by
Gamma_q(1) permit to express the energy of the n-magnon bound states in a
closed form in terms of Tchebischeff polynomials.
