  A reorganized perturbation expansion with a propagator of soft infrared
behavior is used to study the critical behavior of the mass gap. The condition
of relativistic covariance fixes the form of the soft propagator. Finite
approximants to the correlation critical exponent can be obtained in every
order of the modified, soft perturbation expansion. Alternatively, a convergent
series of exponents in large orders of the soft perturbation expansion is
provided by the renormalization group in all spatial dimensions, $1\leq
D\leq3$. The result of the $\epsilon$-expansion is recovered in the
$D\rightarrow 3 $ limit.
