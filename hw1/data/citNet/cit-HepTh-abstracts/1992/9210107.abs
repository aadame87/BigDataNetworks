  We show that an integral transform of the fluctuations of the collective
field of the $d=1$ matrix model satisfy the same linearized equation as that of
the massless "tachyon" in the black hole background of the two dimensional
critical string. This suggests that the $d=1$ matrix model may provide a
non-perturbative description of black holes in two dimensional string theory.
