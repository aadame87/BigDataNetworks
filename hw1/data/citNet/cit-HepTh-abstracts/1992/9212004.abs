  We discuss various aspects of the calculation of correlation functions in
conformal theories coupled to quantized 2-dimensional gravity. The main
emphasis lies on the construction of a continuation in the number of insertions
of the cosmological constant operator for $arbitrary$ dimension of the target
space. Following closely our paper \cite{DO2} we add a more extended
introduction and discussion of the peculiarities in 1-dimensional target space
as well as some further remarks about the 4-point function.
