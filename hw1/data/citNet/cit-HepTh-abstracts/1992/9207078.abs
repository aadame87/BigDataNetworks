  The ring structure of Lian-Zuckerman states for $(q,p)$ minimal models
coupled to gravity is shown to be ${\cal R}={\cal R}_0\otimes {\bf C}
[w,w^{-1}]$ where ${\cal R}_0$ is the ring of ghost number zero operators
generated by two elements and $w$ is an operator of ghost number $-1$. Some
examples are discussed in detail. For these models the currents are also
discussed and their algebra is shown to contain the Virasoro algebra.
