  In general quantum systems there are two kinds of spacetime modes, those that
fluctuate and those that do not. Fluctuating modes have normalizable
wavefunctions. In the context of 2D gravity and ``non-critical'' string theory
these are called macroscopic states. The theory is independent of the initial
Euclidean background values of these modes. Non-fluctuating modes have
non-normalizable wavefunctions and correspond to microscopic states. The theory
depends on the background value of these non-fluctuating modes, at least to all
orders in perturbation theory. They are superselection parameters and should
not be minimized over. Such superselection parameters are well known in field
theory. Examples in string theory include the couplings $t_k$ (including the
cosmological constant) in the matrix models and the mass of the two-dimensional
Euclidean black hole. We use our analysis to argue for the finiteness of the
string perturbation expansion around these backgrounds.
