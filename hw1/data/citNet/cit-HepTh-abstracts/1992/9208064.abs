  We compute N-point correlation functions of pure vertex operator states(DK
states) for minimal models coupled to gravity. We obtain agreement with the
matrix model results on analytically continuing in the numbers of cosmological
constant operators and matter screening operators. We illustrate this for the
cases of the $(2k-1,2)$ and $(p+1,p)$ models.
