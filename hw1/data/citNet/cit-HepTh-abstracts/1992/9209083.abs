  The n-point function for the integral over unitary matrices with
Itzykson-Zuber measure is reduced to the integral over Gelfand-Tzetlin table;
integrand (for generic n) is given by linear exponential times rational
function. For $n=2$ and in some cases for $n>2$ later in fact is the polinomial
and this allows to give an explicit and simple expression for all 2-point and a
set of n-point functions. For the most general n-point function a simple linear
differential equation is constructed.
