  We consider whether current notions about superstring theory below the Planck
scale are compatible with cosmology. We find that the anticipated form for the
dilaton interaction creates a serious roadblock for inflation and makes it
unlikely that the universe ever reaches a state with zero cosmological constant
and time-independent gravitational constant.
