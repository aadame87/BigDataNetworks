  For time-periodical quantum systems generalized Floquet operator is found to
be integral of motion.Spectrum of this invariant is shown to be quasienergy
spectrum.Analogs of invariant Floquet operators are found for nonperiodical
systems with several characteristic times.Generalized quasienergy states are
introduced for these systems. Geometrical phase is shown to be integral of
motion.
