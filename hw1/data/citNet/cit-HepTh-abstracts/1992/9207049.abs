  We derive the basic correlation functions of twist fields coming from
arbitrary twisted sectors in symmetric $Z_N$ orbifold conformal field theories,
keeping all the admissible marginal perturbations, in particular those
corresponding to the antisymmetric tensor background field. This allows a
thorough investigation of modular symmetries in this type of string
compactification. Such a study is explicitly carried out for the group
generated by duality transformations. Thus, apart from being of
phenomenological use, our couplings are also interesting from the mathematical
point of view as they represent automorphic functions for a large class of
discrete groups.
