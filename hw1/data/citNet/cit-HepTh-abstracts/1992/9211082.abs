  Reduced phase space formulation of CGHS model of 2d dilaton gravity is
studied in en extrinsic time gauge. The corresponding Hamiltonian can be
promoted into a Hermitian operator acting in the physical Hilbert space,
implying a unitary evolution for the system. Consequences for the black hole
physics are discussed. In particular, this manifestly unitary theory rules out
the Hawking scenario for the endpoint of the black hole evaporation process.
