  We examine the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) model on a circle and
compute the Poisson bracket algebra for left and right moving chiral group
elements. Our computations apply for arbitrary groups and boundary conditions,
the latter being characterized by the monodromy matrix. Unlike in previous
treatments, they do not require specifying a particular parametrization of the
group valued fields in terms of angles spanning the group. We do however find
it necessary to make a gauge choice, as the chiral group elements are not gauge
invariant observables. (On the other hand, the quadratic form of the Poisson
brackets may be defined independent of a gauge fixing.) Gauge invariant
observables can be formed from the monodromy matrix and these observables are
seen to commute in the quantum theory.
