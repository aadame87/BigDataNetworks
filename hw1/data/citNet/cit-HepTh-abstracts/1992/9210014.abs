Title: Two--poles R-matrices
Authors: M. Talon
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We study integrable dynamical systems described by a Lax pair involving a
spectral parameter. By solving the classical Yang-Baxter equation when the
R-matrix has two poles we show that they can be interpreted as natural motions
on a twisted loop algebra.
