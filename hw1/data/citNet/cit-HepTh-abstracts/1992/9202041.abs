Title: Exact Critical Exponents of the Staircase Model
Authors: Michael Lassig
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  The staircase model is a recently discovered one-parameter family of
integrable two-dimensional continuum field theories. We analyze the novel
critical behavior of this model, seen as a perturbation of a minimal conformal
theory M_p: the leading thermodynamic singularities are simultaneously governed
by all fixed points M_p, M_{p-1}, ..., M_3. The exponents of the magnetic
susceptibility and the specific heat are obtained exactly. Various corrections
to scaling are discussed, among them a new type specific to crossover phenomena
between critical fixed points.
