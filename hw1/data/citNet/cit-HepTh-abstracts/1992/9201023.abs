Title: $SL(\infty,R)$ Symmetry of $W_\infty$ Gravity

  Two-dimensional gravity in the light-cone gauge was shown by Polyakov to
exhibit an underlying $SL(2,R)$ Kac-Moody symmetry, which may be used to
express the energy-momentum tensor for the metric component $h_{++}$ in terms
of the $SL(2,R)$ currents {\it via}\ the Sugawara construction. We review some
recent results which show that in a similar manner, $W_\infty$ and
$W_{1+\infty}$ gravities have underlying $SL(\infty,R)$ and $GL(\infty,R)$
Kac-Moody symmetries respectively.
