  We study the statistics of vortices which appear in (2+1)--dimensional
spontaneously broken gauge theories, where a compact group G breaks to a finite
nonabelian subgroup H. Two simple models are presented. In the first, a quantum
state which is symmetric under the interchange of a pair of indistinguishable
vortices can be transformed into an antisymmetric state after the passage
through the system of a third vortex with an appropriate $H$-flux element.
Further, there exist states containing two indistinguishable spinless vortices
which obey Fermi statistics. These results generalize to loops of nonabelian
cosmic string in 3+1 dimensions. In the second model, fractional analogues of
the above behaviors occur. Also, composites of vortices in this theory may
possess fractional ``Cheshire spin'' which can be changed by passing an
additional vortex through the system.
