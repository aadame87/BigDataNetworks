  Supergeneralization of $\DC P(N)$ provided by even and odd K\"ahlerian
structures from Hamiltonian reduction are construct.Operator $ \Delta$ which
used in Batalin-- Vilkovisky quantization formalism and mechanics which are
bi-Hamiltonian under corresponding even and odd Poisson brackets are
considered.
