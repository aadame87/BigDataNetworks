Title: A note on the 3D Ising model as a string theory
Author: J. Distler
Comments: 21 pages, 11 figures. This revised manuscript is identical to the
  final published version (Nuclear Physics B, to appear). Aside from correcting
  some scattered typos, the final version corrects and expands some of the
  comments in the original preprint on the unoriented NSR string

  It has long been argued that the continuum limit of the 3D Ising model is
equivalent to a string theory. Unfortunately, in the usual starting point for
this equivalence -- a certain lattice theory of surfaces -- it is not at all
obvious how to take the continuum limit. In this note, I reformulate the
lattice theory of surfaces in a fashion such that the continuum limit is
straightforward. I go on to discuss how this new formulation may overcome some
fundamental objections to the notion that the Ising model is equivalent to a
string theory. In an appendix, I also discuss some aspects of fermion doubling,
and the lattice fermion formulation of the 2D Ising model.
