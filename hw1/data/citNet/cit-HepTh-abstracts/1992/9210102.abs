  The extension of dynamical scaling to local, space-time dependent rescaling
factors is investigated. For a dynamical exponent $z=2$, the corresponding
invariance group is the Schr\"odinger group. Schr\"odinger invariance is shown
to determine completely the two-point correlation function. The result is
checked in two exactly solvable models.
