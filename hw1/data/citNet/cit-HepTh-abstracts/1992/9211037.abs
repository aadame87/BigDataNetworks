  A master equation ( $n$ dimensional non--Abelian current conservation law
with mutually commuting current components ) is introduced for
multi-dimensional non-linear field theories. It is shown that the master
equation provides a systematic way to understand 2-d integrable non-linear
equations as well as 4-d self-dual equations and, more importantly, their
generalizations to higher dimensions.
