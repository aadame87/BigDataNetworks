  The Euclidean analogues of the sine-Gordon solitons are used as sources of
the heterotic fivebrane solutions in the ten-dimensional heterotic string
theory. Some properties of these soliton solutions are discussed. These
solitons in principle can appear as string-like objects in 4-dimensional
space-time after proper compactifications.
