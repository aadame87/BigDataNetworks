  A brief review is given of an adaptation of the coadjoint orbit method
appropriate for study of models with infinite-dimensional symmetry groups. It
is illustrated on several examples, including derivation of the WZNW action of
induced $D=2\,$ $(N,0)\,$ supergravity. As a main application, we present the
geometric action on a generic coadjoint orbit of the deformed group of area
preserving diffeomorphisms. This action is precisely the anomalous effective
WZNW action of $D=2 \,$ matter fields coupled to chiral $W_\infty$ gravity
background. Similar actions are given which produce the {\em KP} hierarchy as
on-shell equations of motion.
