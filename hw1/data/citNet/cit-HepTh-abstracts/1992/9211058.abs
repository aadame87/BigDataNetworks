  We examine a model of non-self-avoiding, fluctuating surfaces as a candidate
continuum string theory of surfaces in three dimensions. This model describes
Dynamically Triangulated Random Surfaces embedded in three dimensions with an
extrinsic curvature dependent action. We analyze, using Monte Carlo
simulations, the dramatic crossover behaviour of several observables which
characterize the geometry of these surfaces. We then critically discuss whether
our observations are indicative of a phase transition.
