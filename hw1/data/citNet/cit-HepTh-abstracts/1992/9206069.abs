Title: Two Dimensional String Theory And Black Holes
Authors: Edward Witten
Comments: 15 pp

\\
  This lecture surveys a few loosely related topics, ranging from the scarcity
of quantum field theories -- and the role that this has played, and still
plays, in physics -- to paradoxes involving black holes in soluble two
dimensional string theory and the question of whether naked singularities might
be of even greater interest to string theorists than black holes.
