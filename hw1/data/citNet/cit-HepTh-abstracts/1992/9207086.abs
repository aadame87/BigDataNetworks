  We give the exact solution of the Kazakov-Migdal induced gauge model in the
case of a D=1 compactified lattice with a generic number $S$ of sites and for
any value of N. Due to the peculiar features of the model, the partition
function that we obtain also describes the vortex-free sector of the D=1
compactified bosonic string, and it coincides in the continuum limit with the
one obtained by Boulatov and Kazakov in this context.
