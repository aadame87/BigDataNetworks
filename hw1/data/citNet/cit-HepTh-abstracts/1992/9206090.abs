  We obtain in closed form averages of polynomials, taken over hermitian
matrices with the Gaussian measure involved in the Kontsevich integral, and
prove a conjecture of Witten enabling one to express analogous averages with
the full (cubic potential) measure, as derivatives of the partition function
with respect to traces of inverse odd powers of the external argument. The
proofs are based on elementary algebraic identities involving a new set of
invariant polynomials of the linear group, closely related to the general Schur
functions.
