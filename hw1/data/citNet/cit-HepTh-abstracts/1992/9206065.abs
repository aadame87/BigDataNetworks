  We construct a quantum thermal field theory for scalar particles in the case
of infinite statistics. The extension is provided by working out the Fock space
realization of a "quantum algebra", and by identifying the hamiltonian as the
energy operator. We examine the perturbative behavior of this theory and in
particular the possible extension of the KLN theorem, and argue that it appears
as a stable structure in a quantum field theory context.
