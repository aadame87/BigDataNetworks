  We show that several WZW coset models can be obtained by applying O(d,d)
symmetry transformations (referred to as twisting) on WZW models. This leads to
a conjecture that WZW models gauged by U(1)^n subgroup can be obtained by
twisting (ungauged) WZW models.  In addition, a class of solutions that
describe charged black holes in four dimensions is derived by twisting
SL(2,R)\times SU(2) WZW.
