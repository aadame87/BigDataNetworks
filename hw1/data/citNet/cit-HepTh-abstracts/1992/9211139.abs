  We investigate Weyl anomalies on a curved world sheet to second order in a
weak field expansion. Using a local version of the exact renormalization group
equations, we obtain nonperturbative results for the tachyon/graviton/dilaton
system. We discuss the elimination of redundant operators, which play a crucial
role for the emergence of target space covariance. Performing the operator
product expansion on a curved world sheet allows us to obtain the
nonperturbative contributions to the dilaton $\beta$ function. We find the
$\beta$ functions, after suitable field redefinitions, to be related to a
target space effective action through a $\kappa$ function involving
derivatives. Also we can establish a nonperturbative Curci-Paffuti relation
including the tachyon $\beta$ function.
