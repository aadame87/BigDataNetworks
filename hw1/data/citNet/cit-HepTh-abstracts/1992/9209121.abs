  The effect of de Sitter transformations on Tsamis and Woodard's solutions to
the linearized gauge fixed equations of motion of quantum gravity in a de
Sitter space background is worked out explicitly. It is shown that these
solutions are closed under the transformations of the de Sitter group. To do
this it is necessary to use a compensating gauge transformation to return the
transformed solution to the original gauge.
