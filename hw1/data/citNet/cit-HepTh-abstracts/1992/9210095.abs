  Various Hamiltonian actions of loop groups $\wt G$ and of the algebra
$\text{diff}_1$ of first order differential operators in one variable
are defined on the cotangent bundle $T^*\wt G$ of a Loop Group.
The moment maps generating  the $\text{diff}_1$ actions are shown to
factorize through those generating the loop group actions, thereby defining
commuting diagrams of Poisson maps  to the duals of the corresponding centrally
extended algebras. The maps are  then used to derive a number of infinite
commuting families of Hamiltonian flows that are nonabelian generalizations of
the dispersive water wave hierarchies. As a further application, sets of pairs
of generators of the nonabelian mKdV hierarchies are shown to give a commuting
hierarchy on $T^*\wt G$ that contain the WZW system as its first element.
