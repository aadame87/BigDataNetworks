  We study the Turaev-Viro invariant as the Euclidean Chern-Simons-Witten
gravity partition function with positive cosmological constant. After
explaining why it can be identified as the partition function of 3-dimensional
gravity, we show that the initial data of the TV invariant can be constructed
from the duality data of a certain class of rational conformal field theories,
and that, in particular, the original Turaev-Viro's initial data is associated
with the $A_{k+1}$ modular invariant WZW model. As a corollary we then show
that the partition function $Z(M)$ is bounded from above by $Z((S^2\times
S^1)^{\sharp g}) =(S_{00})^{-2g+2}\sim \Lambda^{-\frac{3g-3}{2}}$, where $g$ is
the smallest genus of handlebodies with which $M$ can be presented by Hegaard
splitting. $Z(M)$ is generically very large near $\Lambda\sim +0$if $M$ is
neither $S^3$ nor a lens space, and many-wormholeconfigurations dominate near
$\Lambda\sim +0$ in the sense that $Z(M)$ generically tends to diverge faster
as the ``number of wormholes'' $g$ becomes larger.
