  The renormalization structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity is
investigated, in a covariant gauge. One-loop divergences of the effective
action are calculated. All the surface divergent terms are taken into account,
thus completing previous one-loop calculations of the theory. It is shown that
the on-shell effective action contains only surface divergences. The off-shell
renormalizability of the theory is discussed and classes of renormalizable
dilaton and Maxwell potentials are found.
