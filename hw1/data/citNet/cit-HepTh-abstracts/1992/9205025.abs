  We study the scattering of a massless and neutral test particle in the
gravitational field of a body (the string star) made of a large number of
scalar states of the superstring. We consider two cases, the one in which these
states are neutral string excitations massive already in ten dimensions and the
one in which their masses (and charges) originate in the process of
compactification on tori. A perturbative calculation based on superstring
amplitudes gives us the deflection angle up to the second order in Newton's
constant. A comparison with field theory explicitly shows which among the
various massless fields of the superstring give a contribution to the
scattering process. In both cases, the deflection angle is smaller than the one
computed in general relativity. The perturbative series can be resummed by
finding the exact solution to the classical equations of motion of the
corresponding low-energy action. The space-time metric of our two examples of
string stars has no horizon.
