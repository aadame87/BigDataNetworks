  We describe deformations of non-linear (birational) representations of
discrete groups generated by involutions, having their origin in the theory of
the symmetric five-state Potts model. One of the deformation parameters can be
seen as the number $q$ of states of a chiral Potts models. This analogy becomes
exact when $q$ is a Fermat number. We analyze the stability of the
corresponding dynamics, with a particular attention to orbits of finite order.
