Title: The l-State Boson Algebra as a Non-Standard Quantum Double and its
  Universal R-Matrix for Yang-Baxer Equation

  In this paper we construct a new quantum double by endowing the l-state
bosonalgebra with a non-trivial Hopf algebra structure,which is not a
q-deformation of the Lie algebra or superalgebra.The universal R-matrix for the
Yang-Baxter equation associated with this new quantum group structure is
obtained explicitly.By building the representations of this quantum double,we
get some R-matrices ,which can result in new representations of the braid
group.
