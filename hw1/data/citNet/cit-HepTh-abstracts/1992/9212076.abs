  There being no precise definition of the quantum integrability, the
separability of variables can serve as its practical substitute. For any
quantum integrable model generated by the Yangian Y[sl(3)] the canonical
coordinates and the conjugated operators are constructed which satisfy the
``quantum characteristic equation'' (quantum counterpart of the spectral
algebraic curve for the L operator). The coordinates constructed provide a
local separation of variables. The conditions are enlisted which are necessary
for the global separation of variables to take place.
