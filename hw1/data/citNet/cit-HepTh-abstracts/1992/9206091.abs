  The hierarchical nonlinear super-differential equations are identified which
describe universal behavior of the discretized model of $2d$ supergravity
recently proposed. This is done by first taking a double scaling limit of the
super Virasoro constraints ( at finite $N$) of the model and by rederiving it
from the $\tilde{G}_{-1/2}$ constraint and the two reduction of the super KP
hierarchy discussed. The double-scaled constraints are found to be described by
a twisted scalar and a Ramond fermion.
