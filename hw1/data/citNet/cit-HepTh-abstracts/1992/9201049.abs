  Explicit construction of the light-cone gauge quantum theory of bosonic
strings in 1+1 spacetime dimensions reveals unexpected structures. One is the
existence of a gauge choice that gives a free action at the price of
propagating ghosts and a nontrivial BRST charge. Fixing this gauge leaves a
U(1) Kac-Moody algebra of residual symmetry, generated by a conformal tensor of
rank two and a conformal scalar. Another is that the BRST charge made from
these currents is nilpotent when the action includes a linear dilaton
background, independent of the particular value of the dilaton gradient.
Spacetime Lorentz invariance in this theory is still elusive, however, because
of the linear dilaton background and the nature of the gauge symmetries.
