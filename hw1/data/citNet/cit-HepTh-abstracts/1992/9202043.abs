  We study in detail the quantization of a model which apparently describes
chiral bosons. The model is based on the idea that the chiral condition could
be implemented through a linear constraint. We show that the space of states is
of indefinite metric. We cure this disease by introducing ghost fields in such
a way that a BRST symmetry is generated. A quartet algebra is seen to emerge.
The quartet mechanism, then, forces all physical states, but the vacuum, to
have zero norm.
