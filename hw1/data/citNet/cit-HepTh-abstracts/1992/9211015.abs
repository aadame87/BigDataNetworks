  We present a detailed calculation of the entropy and action of $U(1)~2$
dilaton black holes, and show that both quantities coincide with one quarter of
the area of the event horizon. Our methods of calculation make it possible to
find an explanation of the rule $S = A/4$ for all static, spherically symmetric
black holes studied so far. We show that the only contribution to the entropy
comes from the extrinsic curvature term at the horizon, which gives $S = A/4$
independently of the charge(s) of the black hole, presence of scalar fields,
etc. Previously, this result did not have a general explanation, but was
established on a case-by-case basis. The on-shell Lagrangian for maximally
supersymmetric extreme dilaton black holes is also calculated and shown to
vanish, in agreement with the result obtained by taking the limit of the
expression obtained for black holes with regular horizon.The physical meaning
of the entropy is discussed in relation to the issue of splitting of extreme
black holes.
