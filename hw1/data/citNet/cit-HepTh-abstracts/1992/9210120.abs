  We discuss the classical 2-dim. black-hole in the framework of the
non-perturbative formulation (in terms of non-relativistic fermions) of c=1
string field theory. We identify an off-shell operator whose classical equation
of motion is that of tachyon in the classical graviton-dilaton black-hole
background. The black-hole `singularity' is identified with the fermi surface
in the phase space of a single fermion, and as such is a consequence of the
semi-classical approximation. An exact treatment reveals that stringy quantum
effects wash away the classical singularity.
