  Perturbative renormalization of a non-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge theory is
examined. It is demonstrated by explicit calculation that, in the pure
Chern-Simons theory, the beta-function for the coefficient of the Chern-Simons
term vanishes to three loop order. Both dimensional regularization and
regularization by introducing a conventional Yang-Mills component in the action
are used. It is shown that dimensional regularization is not gauge invariant at
two loops. A variant of this procedure, similar to regularization by
dimensional reduction used in supersymmetric field theories is shown to obey
the Slavnov-Taylor identity to two loops and gives no renormalization of the
Chern-Simons term. Regularization with Yang-Mills term yields a finite
integer-valued renormalization of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term at
one loop, and we conjecture no renormalization at higher order. We also examine
the renormalization of Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter. We show that in
the non-abelian case the Chern-Simons gauge field as well as the matter fields
require infinite renormalization at two loops and therefore obtain nontrivial
anomalous dimensions. We show that the beta function for the gauge coupling
constant is zero to two-loop order, consistent with the topological
quantization condition for this constant.
