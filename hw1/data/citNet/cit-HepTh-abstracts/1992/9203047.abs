  We study the effect of a Chern-Simons term in a theory with discrete gauge
group H, which in (2+1)-dimensional space time describes (non-abelian) anyons.
As in a previous paper, we emphasize the underlying algebraic structure, namely
the Hopf algebra D(H). We argue on physical grounds that the addition of a
Chern-Simons term in the action leads to a non-trivial 3-cocycle on D(H).
Accordingly, the physically inequivalent models are labelled by the elements of
the cohomology group H^3(H,U(1)). It depends periodically on the coefficient of
the Chern-Simons term which model is realized. This establishes a relation with
the discrete topological field theories of Dijkgraaf and Witten. Some
representative examples are worked out explicitly.
