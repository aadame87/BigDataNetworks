  The number of ghost states at each energy level in a non-unitary conformal
field theory is encoded in the signature characters of the relevant Virasoro
algebra highest weight representations. We give expressions for these signature
characters. These results complete Friedan-Qiu-Shenker's analysis of the
Virasoro algebra's highest weight representations.
