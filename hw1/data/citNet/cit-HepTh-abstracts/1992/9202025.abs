  A generalization of BRST field theory is presented, based on wave operators
for the fields constructed out of, but different from the BRST operator. We
discuss their quantization, gauge fixing and the derivation of propagators. We
show, that the generalized theories are relevant to relativistic particle
theories in the Brink-Di Vecchia-Howe-Polyakov (BDHP) formulation, and argue
that the same phenomenon holds in string theories. In particular it is shown,
that the naive BRST formulation of the BDHP theory leads to trivial quantum
field theories with vanishing correlation functions.
