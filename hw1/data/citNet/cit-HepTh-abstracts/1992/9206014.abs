  We find the discrete states of the c=1 string in the light-cone gauge of
Polyakov. When the state space of the gravitational sector of the theory is
taken to be the irreducible representations of the SL(2,R) current algebra, the
cohomology of the theory is NOT the same as that in the conformal gauge. In
particular, states with ghost numbers up to 4 appear. However, after taking the
space of the theory to be the Fock space of the Wakimoto free-field
representation of the SL(2,R), the light-cone and conformal gauges are
equivalent. This supports the contention that the discrete states of the theory
are physical. We point out that the natural states in the theory do not satisfy
the KPZ constraints.
