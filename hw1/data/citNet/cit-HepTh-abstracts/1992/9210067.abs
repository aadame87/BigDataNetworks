  two dimensions
Authors: J. Hietarinta
Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX
\\
  We describe how the complete solution to the two-dimensional constant quantum
Yang-Baxter equation [J. Hietarinta, Phys. Lett. A165,245(1992)] was found.
(Talk presented at the XIX International Colloquium on Group Theoretical
Methods in Physics.)
