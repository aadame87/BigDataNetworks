  We analyze the allowed spectrum of electric and magnetic charges carried by
dyons in (toroidally compactified) heterotic string theory in four dimensions
at arbitrary values of the string coupling constant and $\theta$ angle. The
spectrum is shown to be invariant under electric-magnetic duality
transformation, thereby providing support to the conjecture that this is an
exact symmetry in string theory.
