  We consider a string theory with two types of strings with geometric
interaction. We show that the theory contains strings with constant Dirichlet
boundary condition and those strings are glued together by 2-d topological
gravity with macroscopic boundaries. A light-cone string field theory is given
and the theory has interactions to all orders. (Postscript files of the figures
