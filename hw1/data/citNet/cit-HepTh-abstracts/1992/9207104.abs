  Degenerations of Lie algebras of meromorphic vector fields on elliptic curves
(i.e. complex tori) which are holomorphic outside a certain set of points
(markings) are studied. By an algebraic geometric degeneration process certain
subalgebras of Lie algebras of meromorphic vector fields on P^1 the Riemann
sphere are obtained. In case of some natural choices of the markings these
subalgebras are explicitly determined. It is shown that the number of markings
can change. AMS subject classification (1991): 17B66, 17B90, 14F10, 14H52,
