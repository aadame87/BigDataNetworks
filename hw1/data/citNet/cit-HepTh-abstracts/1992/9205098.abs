  The general theory of matching conditions is developed for gravitational
theories in two spacetime dimensions. Models inspired from general relativity
and from string theory are considered. These conditions are used to study
collapsing dust solutions in spacetimes with non-zero cosmological constant,
demonstrating how two-dimensional black holes can arise as the endpoint of such
collapse processes.
