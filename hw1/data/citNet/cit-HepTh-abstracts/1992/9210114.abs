  We show that a single uncharged chiral superfield, canonically coupled to
\mbox{$N=1$} supergravity with vanishing superpotential, naturally drives
inflation in the early universe for a class of simple Kahler potentials.
Inflation occurs due to the one-loop generation of a Kahler anomaly
proportional to $\R^2$. The coefficient of this $\R^2$ term is of the correct
magnitude to describe all aspects of an inflationary cosmology, including
sufficient amplitude perturbations and reheating. Higher order terms
proportional to $\R^n$ for $n \geq 3$ are naturally suppressed relative to the
$\R^2$ term and, hence, do not destabilize the theory.
