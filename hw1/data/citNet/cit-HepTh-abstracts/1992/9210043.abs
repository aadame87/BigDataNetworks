Title: Finite $W$ symmetry in finite dimensional integrable systems

  By generalizing the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction a large class of $W$ algebras
can be constructed. We introduce 'finite' versions of these algebras by Poisson
reducing Kirillov Poisson structures on simple Lie algebras. A closed and
coordinate free formula for the reduced Poisson structure is given. These
finitely generated algebras play the same role in the theory of $W$ algebras as
the simple Lie algebras in the theory of Kac-Moody algebras and will therefore
presumably play an important role in the representation theory of $W$ algebras.
We give an example leading to a quadratic $sl_2$ algebra. The finite
dimensional unitary representations of this algebra are discussed and it is
shown that they have Fock realizations. It is also shown that finite
dimensional generalized Toda theories are reductions of a system describing a
free particle on a group manifold. These finite Toda systems have the
non-linear finite $W$ symmetry discussed above. Talk given at the `workshop on
low dimensional topology and physics', Cambridge, September 1992.
