  We compute N-point correlation functions of non-unitary (2k-1, 2) minimal
matter coupled to 2D quantum gravity on a sphere using the continuum Liouville
field approach. A gravitational dressing of the matter primary field with the
minimum conformal weight is used as the cosmological operator. Our results are
in agreement with the correlation functions of the one-matrix model at the k-th
critical point.
