\\
  A unified treatment of both superconformal and quasisuperconformal algebras
with quadratic non-linearity is given. General formulas describing their
structure are found by solving the Jacobi identities. A complete classification
of quasisuperconformal and ${\bf Z}_2\times{\bf Z}_2$-graded algebras are
obtained and in addition to the previously known cases five exceotional
quasisuperconformal algebras and a series of ${\bf Z}_2\times{\bf
Z}_2$-superconformal algebras containing affine
$\widehat{sp}_2\otimes\widehat{osp}(N|2M)$ are constructed.
