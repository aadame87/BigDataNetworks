  We calculate the lowest translationally invariant levels of the Z_3- and
Z_4-symmetrical chiral Potts quantum chains, using numerical diagonalization of
the hamiltonian for N <= 12 and N <= 10 sites, respectively, and extrapolating
N to infinity. In the high-temperature massive phase we find that the pattern
of the low-lying zero momentum levels can be explained assuming the existence
of n-1 particles carrying Z_n-charges Q = 1, ... , n-1 (mass m_Q), and their
scattering states. In the superintegrable case the masses of the n-1 particles
become proportional to their respective charges: m_Q = Q m_1. Exponential
convergence in N is observed for the single particle gaps, while power
convergence is seen for the scattering levels. We also verify that
qualitatively the same pattern appears for the self-dual and integrable cases.
For general Z_n we show that the energy-momentum relations of the particles
show a parity non-conservation asymmetry which for very high temperatures is
exclusive due to the presence of a macroscopic momentum P_m=(1-2Q/n)/\phi,
where \phi is the chiral angle and Q is the Z_n-charge of the respective
particle.
