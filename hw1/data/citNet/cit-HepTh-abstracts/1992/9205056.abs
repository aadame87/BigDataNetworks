  The string equation for the $[{\tilde P},Q]=Q$ formulation of
non--perturbatively stable 2D quantum gravity coupled to the $(2m-1,2)$ models
is studied. Global KdV flows between the appropriate solutions are considered
as deformations of two compatible linear problems. It is demonstrated that the
necessary conditions for such flows to exist are satisfied. A numerical study
reveals such flows between the pole--free solutions of pure gravity ($m=2$),
the Lee--Yang edge model ($m=3$) and topological gravity ($m=1$). We conjecture
that this is the case for all of the $m$--critical models. As the $m=1$
solution is unique these global flows define a {\sl unique} solution for each
$m$--critical model.
