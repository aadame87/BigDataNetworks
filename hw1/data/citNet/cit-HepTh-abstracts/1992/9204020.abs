  The fusion of fields in a rational conformal field theory gives rise to a
ring structure which has a very particular form. All such rings studied so far
were shown to arise from some potentials. In this paper the fusion rings of the
WZW models based on the symplectic group are studied. It is shown that they
indeed arise from potentials which are described. These potentials give rise to
new massive perturbations of superconformal hermitian symmetric models. The
metric of the perturbation is computed and is shown to be given by solutions of
the sinh--gordon equation. The kink structure of the theories is described, and
it is argued that these field theories are integrable. The $S$ matrices for the
fusion theories are argued to be non--minimal extensions of the $G_k\times G_1/
G_{k+1}$ $S$ matrices with the adjoint perturbation, in the case of $G=SU(N)$.
