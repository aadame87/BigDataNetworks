  We derive the recently proposed BRST charge for non-critical W strings from a
Lagragian approach. The basic observation is that, despite appearances, the
combination of two classical ``matter'' and ``Toda'' w_3 systems leads to a
closed modified gauge algebra, which is of the so-called soft type. Based on
these observations, a novel way to construct critical W_3 strings is given.
