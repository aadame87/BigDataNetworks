  The tensionless limit of the free bosonic string is space-time conformally
symmetric classically. Requiring invariance of the quantum theory in the light
cone gauge tests the reparametrization symmetry needed to fix this gauge. The
full conformal symmetry gives stronger constraints than the Poincar\'e
subalgebra. We find that the symmetry may be preserved in any space-time
dimension, but only if the spectrum is drastically reduced (part of this
reduction is natural in a zero tension limit of the ordinary string spectrum).
The quantum states are required to be symmetric ({\it i.e.} singlets) under
space-time diffeomorphisms, except for the centre of mass wave function.
