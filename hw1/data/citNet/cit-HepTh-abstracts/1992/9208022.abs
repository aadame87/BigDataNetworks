Title: On string field theory for $C \leq 1$
Authors: A. Marshakov
Comments: 15 pages, report FIAN/TD-8/92, revised and improved version

  I present a short review of our results with S.Kharchev, A.Mironov, A.Morozov
and A.Zabrodin on Generalized Kontsevich model which in a sense can be
interpreted as unifying ``string field theory'' for $c < 1$ minimal series
coupled to 2d gravity. The problem of interpolation between different models is
discussed. It is found that this problem is closely connected with
``deformations'' within the set of solutions to KP hierarchy, described by a
sort of reparameterization of a spectral curve and change of asymptotics of the
basis in the Grassmannian. The $c \rightarrow 1$ limit is considered along this
line.
