  The geometry of supermanifolds provided with $Q$-structure (i.e. with odd
vector field $Q$ satisfying $\{ Q,Q\} =0$), $P$-structure (odd symplectic
structure ) and $S$-structure (volume element) or with various combinations of
these structures is studied. The results are applied to the analysis of
Batalin-Vilkovisky approach to the quantization of gauge theories. In
particular the semiclassical approximation in this approach is expressed in
terms of Reidemeister torsion.
