  A generalization of the pseudoclassical action of a spinning particle in the
presence of an anomalous magnetic moment is given. The leading considerations,
to write the action, are gotten from the path integral representation for the
causal Green's function of the generalized (by Pauli) Dirac equation for the
particle with anomalous magnetic momentum in an external electromagnetic field.
The action can be written in reparametrization and supergauge invariant form.
Both operator (Dirac) and path-integral (BFV) quantization are discussed. The
first one leads to the Dirac-Pauli equation, whereas the second one gives the
corresponding propagator. One of the nontrivial points in this case is that
both quantizations schemes demand for consistency to take into account an
operators ordering problem.
