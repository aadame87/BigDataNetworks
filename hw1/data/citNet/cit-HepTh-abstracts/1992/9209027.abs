  We propose a bilocal field theory for mesons in two dimensions obtained as a
kind of non local bosonization of two dimensional QCD. Its semi-classical
expansion is equivalent to the $1/N_c$ expansion of QCD. Using an ansatz we
reduce the classical equation of motion of this theory in the baryon number one
sector to a relativistic Hartree equation and solve it numerically. This (non
topological) soliton is identified with the baryon.
