  Using the reduced WZNW formulation we analyse the classical $W$ orbit content
of the space of classical solutions of the $A_2$ Toda theory. We define the
quantized Toda field as a periodic primary field of the $W$ algebra satifying
the quantized equations of motion.
  We show that this local operator can be constructed consistently only in a
Hilbert space consisting of the representations corresponding to the minimal
models of the $W$ algebra.
