  The discrete model of the real symmetric one-matrix ensemble is analyzed with
a cubic interaction. The partition function is found to satisfy a recursion
relation that solves the model. The double-scaling limit of the recursion
relation leads to a Miura transformation relating the contributions to the free
energy coming from oriented and unoriented random surfaces. This transformation
is the same kind as found with a cuartic interaction.
