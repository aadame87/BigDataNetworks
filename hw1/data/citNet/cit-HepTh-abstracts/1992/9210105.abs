Title: Infinite symmetry and Ward identities in two-dimensional string theory
Authors: Igor R. Klebanov and Andrea Pasquinucci

  We review some of the recent progress in the continuum formulation of
two-dimensional string theory, i.e. two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to
$c=1$ matter. Special attention is devoted to the discrete states and to the
$w_\infty$ algebra they generate. To demonstrate the power of the infinite
symmetry, we use the $w_\infty$ Ward identities to derive recursion relations
among certain classes of correlation functions, which allow to calculate them
exactly. (Lectures delivered by I.R. Klebanov at the Workshop "String Quantum
Gravity and Physics at the Planck Energy Scale", Erice, June 21-28, 1992, and
at the 1992 Trieste Summer School of Theoretical Physics.)
