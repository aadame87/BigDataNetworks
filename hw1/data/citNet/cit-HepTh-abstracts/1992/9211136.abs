  The discovery of black-hole evaporation represented in many respects a
revolutionary event in scientific world; as such, in giving answers to open
questions, it gave rise to new problems part of which are still not resolved.
Here we want to make a brief review of such problems and examine some possible
solutions. Invited Talk at the "Workshop on String Theory, Quantum Gravity and
