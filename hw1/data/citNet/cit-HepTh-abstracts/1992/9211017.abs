  Using the factorization approach of Gepner and Qiu, I systematically rederive
the closed fractional superstring partition functions for K= 4, 8, and 16. For
these theories the relationship between the massless graviton and gravi- tino
sector and the purely massive sectors is explored. Properties of the massive
sectors are investigated. A twist current in these models is found responsible
for the occurrence of N=1 space-time supersymmetry. I show this twist current
transforms bosonic (fermionic) projection states into fermionic (bosonic)
non-projection states and vice-versa.
