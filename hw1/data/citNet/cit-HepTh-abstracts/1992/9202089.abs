  We consider the correlation functions of the tachyon vertex operator of the
super Liouville theory coupled to matter fields in the super Coulomb gas
formulation, on world sheets with spherical topology. After integrating over
the zero mode and assuming that the $s$ parameter takes an integer value, we
subsequently continue it to an arbitrary real number and compute the
correlators in a closed form. We also included an arbitrary number of screening
charges and, as a result, after renormalizing them, as well as the external
legs and the cosmological constant, the form of the final amplitudes do not
modify. The result is remarkably parallel to the bosonic case. For
completeness, we discussed the calculation of bosonic correlators including
arbitrary screening charges.
