Title: Is Purity Eternal?
Authors: Mark Srednicki
Comments: 12 pages, in Plain Tex; section 3 on Lorentz covariance expanded and
  improved in response to year-long correspondence with the referee, but the

\\
  Phenomenological and formal restrictions on the evolution of pure into mixed
states are discussed. In particular, it is argued that, if energy is conserved,
loss of purity is incompatible with the weakest possible form of Lorentz
covariance.
