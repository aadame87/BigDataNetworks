  The recently derived current algebra of classical non-linear sigma models on
arbitrary Riemannian manifolds is extended to include the energy-momentum
tensor. It is found that in two dimensions the energy-momentum tensor
$\theta_{\mu\nu}$, the Noether current $j_\mu$ associated with the global
symmetry of the theory and the composite field $j$ appearing as the coefficient
of the Schwinger term in the current algebra, together with the derivatives of
$j_\mu$ and $j$, generate a closed algebra. The subalgebra generated by the
light-cone components of the energy-momentum tensor consists of two commuting
copies of the Virasoro algebra, with central charge $\, c\!=\!0 $, reflecting
the classical conformal invariance of the theory, but the current algebra part
and the semidirect product structure are quite different from the usual
Kac-Moody / Sugawara type construction.
