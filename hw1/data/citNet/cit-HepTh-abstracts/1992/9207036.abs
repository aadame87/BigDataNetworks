  Recent work on Euler hierarchies of field theory Lagrangians iteratively
constructed {}from their successive equations of motion is briefly reviewed. On
the one hand, a certain triality structure is described, relating arbitrary
field theories, {\it classical\ts} topological field theories -- whose
classical solutions span topological classes of manifolds -- and
reparametrisation invariant theories -- generalising ordinary string and
membrane theories. On the other hand, {\it finite} Euler hierarchies are
constructed for all three classes of theories. These hierarchies terminate with
{\it universal\ts} equations of motion, probably defining new integrable
systems as they admit an infinity of Lagrangians. Speculations as to the
possible relevance of these theories to quantum gravity are also suggested.
