  Using techniques from supergravity and dimensional reduction, we study the
full isometry algebra of K\"ahler and quaternionic manifolds with special
geometry. These two varieties are related by the so-called c-map, which can be
understood from dimensional reduction of supergravity theories or by changing
chirality assignments in the underlying superstring theory. An important
subclass, studied in detail, consists of the spaces that follow from real
special spaces using the so-called r-map. We generally clarify the presence of
`extra' symmetries emerging from dimensional reduction and give the conditions
for the existence of `hidden' symmetries. These symmetries play a major role in
our analysis. We specify the structure of the homogeneous special manifolds as
coset spaces $G/H$. These include all homogeneous quaternionic spaces.
