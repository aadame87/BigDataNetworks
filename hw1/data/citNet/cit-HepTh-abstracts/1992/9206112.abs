  We present the results of a Monte--Carlo simulation of the $G_2^{(1)}$ Affine
Toda field theory action in two dimensions. We measured the ratio of the masses
of the two fundamental particles as a function of the coupling constant. Our
results strongly support the conjectured duality with the $D_4^{(3)}$ theory,
and are consistent with the mass formula of Delius et al.
