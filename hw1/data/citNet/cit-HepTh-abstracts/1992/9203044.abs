  We propose to study a generalization of the Klebanov-Polyakov-Witten (KPW)
construction for the algebra of observables in the $c = 1$ string model to
theories with $c > 1$. We emphasize the algebraic meaning of the KPW
construction for $c = 1$ related to occurrence of a {\it model} of {\it SU}(2)
as original structure on the algebra of observables. The attempts to preserve
this structure in generalizations naturally leads to consideration of
$W$-gravities. As a first step in the study of these generalized KPW
constructions we design explicitly the subsector of the space of observables in
appropriate $W_G$-string theory, which forms the {\it model} of $G$ for any
simply laced {\it G}. The {\it model} structure is confirmed by the fact that
corresponding one-loop Kac-Rocha-Caridi $W_G$-characters for $c = r_G$ sum into
a chiral (open string) $k=1$ $G$-WZW partition function.
