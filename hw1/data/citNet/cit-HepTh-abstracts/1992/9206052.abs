  We propose a class of purely elastic scattering theories generalising the
staircase model of Al. B. Zamolodchikov, based on the affine Toda field
theories for simply-laced Lie algebras g=A,D,E at suitable complex values of
their coupling constants. Considering their Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
equations, we give analytic arguments in support of a conjectured
renormalisation group flow visiting the neighbourhood of each W_g minimal model
in turn.
