  We present an algorithm for determining all inequivalent abelian symmetries
of non-degenerate quasi-homogeneous polynomials and apply it to the recently
constructed complete set of Landau--Ginzburg potentials for $N=2$
superconformal field theories with $c=9$. A complete calculation of the
resulting orbifolds without torsion increases the number of known spectra by
about one third. The mirror symmetry of these spectra, however, remains at the
same low level as for untwisted Landau--Ginzburg models. This happens in spite
of the fact that the subclass of potentials for which the Berglund--H\"ubsch
construction works features perfect mirror symmetry. We also make first steps
into the space of orbifolds with $\ZZ_2$ torsions by including extra trivial
fields.
