  I explore the possibility of finding an equivalent string representation of
two dimensional QCD. I develop the large N expansion of the ${\rm QCD_2}$
partition function on an arbitrary two dimensional Euclidean manifold. If this
is related to a two-dimensional string theory then many of the coefficients of
the ${1\over N}$ expansion must vanish. This is shown to be true to all orders,
giving strong evidence for the existence of a string representation.
