  We present the quantization of the Liouville model defined in light-cone
coordinates in (1,1) signature space. We take advantage of the representation
of the Liouville field by the free field of the Backl\"{u}nd transformation and
adapt the approch by Braaten, Curtright and Thorn.
  Quantum operators of the Liouville field $\partial_{+}\phi$,
$\partial_{-}\phi$, $e^{g\phi}$, $e^{2g\phi}$ are constructed consistently in
terms of the free field. The Liouville model field theory space is found to be
restricted to the sector with field momentum $P_{+}=-P_{-}$, $P_{+}> 0$ , which
is a closed subspace for the Liouville theory operator algebra.
