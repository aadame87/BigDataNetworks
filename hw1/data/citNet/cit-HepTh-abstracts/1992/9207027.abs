  On the example of nonabelian Toda type theory associated with the Lie
superalgebra $osp(2|4)$ we show that this integrable dynamical system is
relevant to a black hole background metric in the corresponding target space.
In the even sector the model under consideration reduces to the exactly
solvable conformal theory (nonabelian $B_2$ Toda system) in the presence of a
black hole recently proposed in the article "Black holes from non-abelian Toda
theories" by the last two authors (hep-th 9203039).
