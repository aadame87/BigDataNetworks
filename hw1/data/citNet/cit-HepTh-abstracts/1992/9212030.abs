  We present plane-wave-type solutions of the lowest order superstring
effective action which have unbroken space-time supersymmetries. They describe
dilaton, axion and gauge fields in a stringy generalization of the Brinkmann
metric. Some conspiracy between the metric and the axion field is required. We
show that there exists a special class of these solutions, for which
$\alpha^\prime$ stringy corrections to the effective on-shell action, to the
equations of motion (and therefore to the solutions themselves), and to the
supersymmetry transformations vanish. We call these solutions supersymmetric
string waves (SSW).
