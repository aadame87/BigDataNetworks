  We study the quantum theory of 1+1 dimensional dilaton gravity, which is an
interesting toy model of the black hole dynamics. The functional measures are
explicitly evaluated and the physical state conditions corresponding to the
Hamiltonian and the momentum constraints are derived. It is pointed out that
the constraints form the Virasoro algebra without central charge. In ADM
formalism the measures are very ambiguous, but in our formalism they are
explicitly defined. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM formalism
come out. A singularity appears at $\df^2 =\kappa (>0) $, where $\kappa
=(N-51/2)/12 $ and $ N$ is the number of matter fields. Behind the singularity
the quantum mechanical region $\kappa > \df^2 >0 $ extends, where the sign of
the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian constraint changes. If $\kappa <0 $, the
singularity disappears. We discuss the quantum dynamics of black hole and then
give a suggestion for the resolution of the information loss paradox. We also
argue the quantization of the spherically symmetric gravitational system in 3+1
dimensions. In appendix the differences between the other quantum dilaton
gravities and ours are clarified and our status is stressed.
