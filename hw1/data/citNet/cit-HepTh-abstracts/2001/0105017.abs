  The existence of future horizons in spacetime geometries poses serious
problems for string theory and quantum field theories. The observation that the
expansion of the universe is accelerating has recently been shown to lead to a
crisis for the mathematical formalism of string and M-theories, since the
existence of a future horizon for an eternally accelerating universe does not
allow the formulation of physical S-matrix observables. Postulating that the
speed of light varies in an expanding universe in the future as well as in the
past can eliminate future horizons, allowing for a consistent definition of
S-matrix observables.
