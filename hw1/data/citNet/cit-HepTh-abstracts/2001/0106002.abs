Title: Boundary String Field Theory Approach to High-Temperature Tachyon
  Potential
Authors: Wung-Hong Huang
Comments: 20 pages, add discussions about boundary action
\\
  The boundary string field theory approach is used to evaluate the one-loop
tachyon potential. We first discuss the boundary condition at the two
boundaries on annulus diagram and then the exact form of corrected potentials
at zero and high temperature are obtained. The profile of the tachyon potential
is found to be temperature independent and tachyon will condense at high
temperature. Our investigations also provide an easy way to prove the
universality of the tachyon potential, even if the string is in the thermal
background.
