  We construct the minimal bosonic higher spin extension of the 7D AdS algebra
SO(6,2), which we call hs(8*). The generators, which have spin s=1,3,5,..., are
realized as monomials in Grassmann even spinor oscillators. Irreducibility, in
the form of tracelessness, is achieved by modding out an infinite dimensional
ideal containing the traces. In this a key role is played by the tree bilinear
traces which form an SU(2)_K algebra. We show that gauging of hs(8*) yields a
spectrum of physical fields with spin s=0,2,4,...which make up a UIR of hs(8*)
isomorphic to the symmetric tensor product of two 6D scalar doubletons. The
scalar doubleton is the unique SU(2)_K invariant 6D doubleton. The spin s\geq 2
sector comes from an hs(8*)-valued one-form which also contains the auxiliary
gauge fields required for writing the curvature constraints in covariant form.
The physical spin s=0 field arises in a separate zero-form in a `quasi-adjoint'
representation of hs(8*). This zero-form also contains the spin s\geq 2 Weyl
tensors, i.e. the curvatures which are non-vanishing on-shell. We suggest that
the hs(8*) gauge theory describes the minimal bosonic, massless truncation of M
theory on AdS_7\times S^4 in an unbroken phase where the holographic dual is
given by N free (2,0) tensor multiplets for large N.
