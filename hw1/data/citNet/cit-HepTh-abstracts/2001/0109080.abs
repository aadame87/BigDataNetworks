  We use the approach to generate spin foam models by an auxiliary field theory
defined on a group manifold (as recently developed in quantum gravity and
quantization of BF-theories) in the context of topological quantum field
theories with a 3-form field strength. Topological field theories of this kind
in seven dimensions are related to the superconformal field theories which live
on the worldvolumes of fivebranes in M-theory. The approach through an
auxiliary field theory for spinfoams gives a topology independent formulation
of such theories.
