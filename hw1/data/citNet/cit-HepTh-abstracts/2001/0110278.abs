  A Green's function approach is presented for the D-dimensional inverse square
potential in quantum mechanics. This approach is implemented by the
introduction of hyperspherical coordinates and the use of a real-space
regulator in the regularized version of the model. The application of
Sturm-Liouville theory yields a closed expression for the radial energy Green's
function. Finally, the equivalence with a recent path-integral treatment of the
same problem is explicitly shown.
