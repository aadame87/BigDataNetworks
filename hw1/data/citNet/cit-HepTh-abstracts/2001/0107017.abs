  The free energy of the Ginzburg-Landau theory satisfies a nonlinear
functional differential equation which is turned into a recursion relation. The
latter is solved graphically order by order in the loop expansion to find all
connected vacuum diagrams, and their corresponding weights. In this way we
determine the connected vacuum diagrams and their weights up to four loops.
