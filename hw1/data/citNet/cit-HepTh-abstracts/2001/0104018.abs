  Presented are the integral solutions to the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations for the correlation functions of both the bulk and boundary XXZ
models in the anti-ferromagnetic regime. The difference equations can be
derived from Smirnov-type master equations for correlation functions on the
basis of the CTM bootstrap. Our integral solutions with an appropriate choice
of the integral kernel reproduce the formulae previously obtained by using the
bosonization of the vertex operators of the quantum affine algebra $U_q
(\hat{\mathfrak{sl}_2})$.
