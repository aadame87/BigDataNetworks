  In this paper I present a spacetime of two open universes connected by a
Lorentzian wormhole. The spacetime has the following features: (1) It can
exactly solve the Einstein equations; (2) The weak energy condition is
satisfied everywhere; (3) It has a topology of R^2\times T_g (g\ge 2); (4) It
has no event horizons.
