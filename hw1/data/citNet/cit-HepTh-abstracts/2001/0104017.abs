  We find the N-soliton solution at infinite theta, as well as the metric on
the moduli space corresponding to spatial displacements of the solitons. We use
a perturbative expansion to incorporate the leading 1/theta corrections, and
find an effective short range attraction between solitons. We study the
stability of various solutions. We discuss the finite theta corrections to
scattering, and find metastable orbits. Upon quantization of the two-soliton
moduli space, for any finite theta, we find an s-wave bound state.
