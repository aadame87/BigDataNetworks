  The non-abelian version of the self-dual model proposed by Townsend, Pilch
and van Nieuwenhuizen presents some well known difficulties not found in the
abelian case, such as well defined duality operation leading to self-duality
and dual equivalence with the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory, for the full
range of the coupling constant. These questions are tackled in this work using
a distinct gauge lifting technique that is alternative to the master action
approach first proposed by Deser and Jackiw. The master action, which has
proved useful in exhibiting the dual equivalence between theories in diverse
dimensions, runs into trouble when dealing with the non-abelian case apart from
the weak coupling regime. This new dualization technique on the other hand, is
insensitive of the non-abelian character of the theory and generalize
straightforwardly from the abelian case. It also leads, in a simple manner, to
the dual equivalence for the case of couplings with dynamical fermionic matter
fields. As an application, we discuss the consequences of this dual equivalence
in the context of 3D non-abelian bosonization.
