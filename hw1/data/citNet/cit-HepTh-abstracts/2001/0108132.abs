Title: A brane in five-dimensional Minkowski space
Authors: J. Avery, R. Mahurin and G. Siopsis
Comments: 8 pages, extended discussion to finite extra dimension and showed
  explicitly that the two solutions correspond to distinct physical systems

  We discuss the propagation of gravity in five-dimensional Minkowski space in
the presence of a four-dimensional brane. We show that there exists a solution
to the wave equation that leads to a propagator exhibiting four-dimensional
behavior at low energies (long distances) with five-dimensional effects showing
up as corrections at high energies (short distances). We compare our results
with propagators derived in previous analyses exhibiting five-dimensional
behavior at low energies. We show that different solutions correspond to
different physical systems.
