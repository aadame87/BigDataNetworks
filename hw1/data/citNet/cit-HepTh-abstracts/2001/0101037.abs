  In relation to the superspace modifications of 11D supergeometry required to
describe the M-theory low-energy effective action, we present an analysis of
infinitesimal supergravity fluctuations about the flat superspace limit. Our
investigation confirms Howe's interpretation of our previous Bianchi identity
analysis. However, the analysis also shows that should 11D supergravity obey
the rules of other off-shell supergravity theories, the complete M-theory
corrections will necessarily excite our previously anticipated spin-1/2
engineering dimension-1/2 spinor auxiliary multiplet superfield. The analysis
of fluctuations yields more evidence that Howe's 1997 theorem is specious when
applied to Poincar\' e supergravity or 11D supergravity/M-theory. We end by
commenting upon recent advances in this area.
