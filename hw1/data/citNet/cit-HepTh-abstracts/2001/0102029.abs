  We derive the hard thermal loop action for soft electromagnetic fields in the
finite temperature world-line formulation at imaginary time, by first
integrating out the hard fermion modes from the microscopic QED action.
Further, using the finite T world-line method, we calculate all static higher
order terms in the soft electromagnetic field. At high T, the leading
non-linear terms are independent of the temperature and, except for a term
quartic in the time component of the vector potential, they cancel exactly
against the vacuum contribution. The remaining T-dependent non-linear terms
become more strongly suppressed by the temperature as the number of soft fields
increases, thus making the expansion reliable. Applications of this method to
other theories and problems at the soft scale are also briefly discussed.
