  We develop a systematic DLCQ perturbation theory and show that DLCQ S-matrix
does not have a covariant continuum limit for processes with $p^+=0$ exchange.
This implies that the role of the zero mode is more subtle than ever considered
in DLCQ and hence must be treated with great care also in non-perturbative
approach. We also make a brief comment on DLCQ in string theory.
