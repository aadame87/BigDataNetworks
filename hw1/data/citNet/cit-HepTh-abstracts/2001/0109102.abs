  We study solitons in scalar theories with polynomial interactions on the
fuzzy sphere. Such solitons are described by projection operators of rank k,
and hence the moduli space for the solitons is the Grassmannian Gr(k,2j+1). The
gradient term of the action provides a non-trivial potential on Gr(k,2j+1),
thus reducing the moduli space. We construct configurations corresponding to
well-separated solitons, and show that although the solitons attract each
other, the attraction vanishes in the limit of large j. In this limit, it is
argued that the moduli space is CP^k. For the k-soliton bound state, the moduli
space is simply CP^1, all other moduli being lifted. We find that the moduli
space of multi-solitons is smooth and that there are no singularities as
several solitons coalesce. When the fuzzy S^2 is flattened to a noncommutative
plane, we find agreement with the known results, modulo some operator-ordering
ambiguities. This suggests that the fuzzy sphere is a natural way to regulate
the noncommutative plane both in the ultraviolet and infrared.
