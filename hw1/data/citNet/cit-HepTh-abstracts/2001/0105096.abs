Title: Massless 3-brane in M-theory
Authors: M. Cvetic, H. Lu and C.N. Pope
Comments: This corrects a previous version in which it was mistakenly claimed
  that the M3-brane solutions are pseudo-supersymmetric rather than
  supersymmetric

  We construct supersymmetric M3-brane solutions in D=11 supergravity. They can
be viewed as deformations of backgrounds taking the form of a direct product of
four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and a non-compact Ricci-flat manifold of
G_2 holonomy. Although the 4-form field strength is turned on it carries no
charge, and the 3-branes are correspondingly massless. We also obtain 3-branes
of a different type, arising as M5-branes wrapped over S^2.
