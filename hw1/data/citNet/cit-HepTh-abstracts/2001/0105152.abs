  We introduce so-called chaotic strings (coupled 1-dimensional noise strings
underlying the Parisi-Wu approach of stochastic quantization on a small scale)
as a possible amendment of ordinary string theories. These strings are strongly
self-interacting and exhibit strongest possible chaotic behavior. Constraints
on the vacuum energy of the strings fix a certain discrete set of allowed
string couplings. We provide extensive numerical evidence that these string
couplings numerically coincide with running standard model coupling constants,
evaluated at energy scales given by the masses of the known quarks, leptons and
gauge bosons. Chaotic strings can thus be used to provide a theoretical
argument why certain standard model parameters are realized in nature, others
are not, assuming that the a priori free standard model parameters evolve to
the minima of the effective potentials. The chaotic string spectrum correctly
reproduces the numerical values of the electroweak and strong coupling
constants with a precision of 4-5 digits, as well as the (free) masses of the
known quarks and leptons with a precision of 3-4 digits. Neutrino mass
predictions consistent with present experiments are obtained. The W boson mass
also comes out correctly, and a Higgs mass prediction is obtained.
