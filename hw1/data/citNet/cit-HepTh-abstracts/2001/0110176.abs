  A path-integral approach for delta-function potentials is presented.
Particular attention is paid to the two-dimensional case, which illustrates the
realization of a quantum anomaly for a scale invariant problem in quantum
mechanics. Our treatment is based on an infinite summation of perturbation
theory that captures the nonperturbative nature of the delta-function bound
state. The well-known singular character of the two-dimensional delta-function
potential is dealt with by considering the renormalized path integral resulting
from a variety of schemes: dimensional, momentum-cutoff, and real-space
regularization. Moreover, compatibility of the bound-state and scattering
sectors is shown.
