  Using the nonabelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action with the Wess-Zumino term that
is constructed in consistent with T duality we examine the Myers dielectric
effect for multiple D0-branes in the near-horizon geometry of D4-branes. The
effect in the curved spacetime is also confirmed by the dual formulation based
on the abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action of a D2-brane. Putting a system of
muliple D-strings in the external electric RR five-form flux, we construct a
noncommutative non-BPS solution where the D-strings expand into a spherical
D3-brane. We discuss the external field dependence of the funnel-like or
wormhole solution.
