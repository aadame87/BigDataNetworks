  Hawking radiation is viewed as a tunnelling process. In this way the effect
of self-gravitation gives rise to semiclassical corrections to the entropy of
the (2+1) BTZ black hole. The modified entropy, due to specific modelling of
the self-gravitation effect, of the (2+1) BTZ black hole is evaluated. To first
order in $\omega$ which is a shell of energy radiated outwards the event
horizon of the BTZ black hole, modified entropy is proportional to the horizon.
In this semiclassical analysis, corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula
$S_{BH}=\mathcal{A}_{H} / 4l_{P}^{2}$ are found to be negative and the
proportionality factor connecting the modified entropy, $S_{bh}$, of the (2+1)
BTZ black hole to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, $S_{BH}$, is evaluated to
first order in $\omega$.
