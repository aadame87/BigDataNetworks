  We investigate aspects of cosmology in brane world theories with a bulk
scalar field. We concentrate on a recent model motivated from supergravity in
singular spaces. After discussing the background evolution of such a
brane-world, we present the evolution of the density contrast. We compare our
results to those obtained in the (second) Randall-Sundrum scenario and usual 4D
scalar-tensor theories.
