  Recently, a condition is derived for a nontrivial solution of the
Schwinger-Dyson equation to be accompanied by a Goldstone bound state in a
special quantum electrodynamics model. This result is extended and a new form
of the Goldstone theorem is obtained in a general quantum field theory
framework.
