  Finite groups are of the greatest importance in science. Loops are a simple
generalization of finite groups: they share all the group axioms except for the
requirement that the binary operation be associative. The least loops that are
not themselves groups are those of order five. We offer a brief discussion of
these loops and challenge the reader (especially Holger) to find useful
applications for them in physics.
