  The local Casimir energy is investigated for a wedge with and without a
circular outer boundary due to the confinement of a massless scalar field with
general curvature coupling parameter and satisfying the Dirichlet boundary
conditions. Regularization procedure is carried out making use of a variant of
the generalized Abel-Plana formula, previously established by one of the
authors. The surface divergences in the vacuum expectation values of the energy
density near the boundaries are considered. The corresponding results can be
applied to the cosmic strings.
