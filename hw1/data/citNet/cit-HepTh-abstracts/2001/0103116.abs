  As a step toward clarification of the power of supersymmetry (SUSY) in Matrix
theory, a complete calculation, including all the spin effects, is performed of
the effective action of a probe D-particle, moving along an arbitrary
trajectory in interaction with a large number of coincident source D-particles,
at one loop at order 4 in the derivative expansion. Furthermore, exploiting the
SUSY Ward identity developed previously, the quantum-corrected effective
supersymmetry transformation laws are obtained explicitly to the relevant order
and are used to verify the SUSY-invariance of the effective action. Assuming
that the agreement with 11-dimensional supergravity persists, our result can be
regarded as a prediction for supergravity calculation, which, yet unavailable,
is known to be highly non-trivial.
