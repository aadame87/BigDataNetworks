  We use the generalised rational map ansatz introduced by Ioannidou et al. to
construct analytically some topologically non-trivial solutions of the
generalised SU(3) Skyrme model defined by adding a sixth order term to the
usual Lagrangian. These solutions are radially symmetric and some of them can
be interpreted as bound states of Skyrmions. The same ansatz is used to
construct low-energy configuration of the SU(N) Skyrme model.
