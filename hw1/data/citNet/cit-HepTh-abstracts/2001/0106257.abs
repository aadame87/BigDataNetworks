  In this work we have constructed the n=4 extended local conformal time
supersymmetry for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological models.
This is based on the superfield construction of the action, which is invariant
under wordline local n=4 supersymmetry with $SU(2)_{local} \otimes
SU(2)_{global}$ internal symmetry. It is shown that the supersymmetric action
has the form of the localized (or superconformal) version of the action for n=4
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This superfield procedure provides a well
defined scheme for including supermatter.
