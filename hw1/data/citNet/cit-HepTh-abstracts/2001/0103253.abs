  We investigate the influence of the fermion field boundary conditions on the
spectrum and wavefunctions of QED$_{1+1}$ in the Discretized Light-Cone
Quantization formalism suggested by Pauli and Brodsky.
  The basic lesson is that one Fourier mode (namely the zero mode) can be
decisive for even the ground state mass. The choice of boundary conditions is
seen to be not important, if and only if all degrees of freedom are treated
properly. This is still a problem for light-cone quantization in general.
