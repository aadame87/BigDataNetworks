  We review four basic examples where string theory and/or field theory
dualities predict the existence of soliton bound-states. These include the
existence of threshold bound-states of D0 branes required by IIA/M duality and
the closely-related bound-states of instantons in the maximally supersymmetric
five dimensional gauge theory. In the IIB theory we discuss (p,q)-strings as
bound-states of D and F strings, as well as the corresponding bound-states of
monopoles and dyons in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory whose existence was
predicted by Sen. In particular we consider the L^2-index theory relevant for
counting these states. In each case we show that the bulk contribution to the
index can be evaluated by relating it to an instanton effect in the
corresponding theory with a compact Euclidean time dimension. The boundary
contribution to the index can be determined by considering the asymptotic
regions of the relevant moduli space.
