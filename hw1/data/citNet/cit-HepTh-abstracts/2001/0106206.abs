  We comment on the recent papers by Costa et al and Emparan, which show how
one might generate supergravity solutions describing certain dielectric branes
in ten dimensions. The ``basic'' such solutions describe either N fundamental
strings or N D4-branes expanding into a D6-brane, with topology M^2 x S^5 or
M^5 x S^2 respectively. Treating these solutions in a unified way, we note that
they allow for precisely two values of the radius of the relevant sphere, and
that the solution with the smaller value of the radius has the lower energy.
Moreover, the possible radii in both cases agree up to numerical factors with
the corresponding solutions of the D6-brane worldvolume theory. We thus argue
that these supergravity solutions are the correct gravitational description of
the dielectric branes of Emparan and Myers.
