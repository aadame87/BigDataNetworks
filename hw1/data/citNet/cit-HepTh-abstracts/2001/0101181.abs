  $AdS_{5}$ with linear dilaton and non vanishing $B$-field is shown to be a
solution of the non critical string beta function equations. A non critical
$(D=5)$ solution interpolating between flat space-time and $AdS_{5}$, with
asymptotic linear dilaton and non vanishing $B$-field is also presented. This
solution is free of space-time singularities and has got the string coupling
constant everywhere bounded. Both solutions admit holographic interpretation in
terms of ${\cal N}=0$ field theories. Closed string tachyon stability is also
discussed.
