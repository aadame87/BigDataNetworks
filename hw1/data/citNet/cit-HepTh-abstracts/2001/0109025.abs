  We study M-theory on two classes of manifolds of Spin(7) holonomy that are
developing an isolated conical singularity. We construct explicitly a new class
of Spin(7) manifolds and analyse in detail the topology of the corresponding
classical spacetimes. We discover also an intricate interplay between various
anomalies in M-theory, string theory, and gauge theory within these models, and
in particular find a connection between half-integral G-fluxes in M-theory and
Chern-Simons terms of the N=1, D=3 effective theory.
