  We present supersymmetric solutions for the theory of gauged supergravity in
five dimensions obtained by gauging the shift symmetry of the axion of the
universal hypermultiplet. This gauged theory can also be obtained by
dimensionally reducing M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold with background flux.
The solution found preserves half of the N=2 supersymmetry, carries electric
fields and has nontrivial scalar field representing the CY-volume. We comment
on the possible solutions of more general hypermultiplet gauging.
