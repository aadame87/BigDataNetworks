  We respond to the criticisms by Kallosh, Kofman and Linde concerning our
proposal of the ekpyrotic universe scenario. We point out a number of errors in
their considerations and argue that, at this stage, the ekpyrotic model is a
possible alternative to inflationary cosmology as a description of the very
early universe.
