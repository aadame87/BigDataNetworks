  A simple five-dimensional brane world model is proposed, motivated by
M-theory compactified on a six-dimensional manifold of small radius and an
$S^1/Z_2$ of large radius. We include a leading-order higher curvature
correction to the tree-level bulk action since in brane world scenarios the
curvature scale in the bulk may be comparable to the five-dimensional Planck
scale and, thus, higher curvature corrections may become important. As a
tractable model of the bulk theory we consider pure gravity including a
$(Ricci-scalar)^4$-correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. In this model
theory, after a conformal transformation to the Einstein frame, we numerically
obtain static solutions, each of which consists of a positive tension brane and
a negative tension brane. For these solutions, we obtain two relations between
the warp factor and the brane tensions. The existence of these relations
implies that, contrary to the original Randall-Sundrum model, the so called
radion is no longer a zero mode. We conclude that the tension of our brane
should be negative and that fine-tuning of the tension of both branes is
necessary for a large warp factor to explain the large hierarchy between the
Planck scale and the electroweak scale.
