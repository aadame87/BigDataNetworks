  We study the covariant quantization of the Green-Schwarz (GS) superstrings
proposed recently by Berkovits. In particular, we reformulate the Berkovits
approach in a way that clarifies its relation with the GS approach and allows
to derive in a straightforward way its extension to curved spacetime
background. We explain the procedure working explicitly in the case of the
heterotic string.
