  We present a new representation of the string vertices of the cubic open
string field theory. By using this three-string vertex, we attempt to identify
open string fields as huge-sized matrices by following Witten's idea. By using
these huge matrices, we obtain some results about the construction of partial
isometries in the algebra of open string fields.
