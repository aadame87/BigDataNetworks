  We discuss the nonabelian world-volume action which governs the dynamics of N
coincident Dp-branes. In this theory, the branes' transverse displacements are
described by matrix-valued scalar fields, and so this is a natural physical
framework for the appearance of noncommutative geometry. One example is the
dielectric effect by which Dp-branes may be polarized into a noncommutative
geometry by external fields. Another example is the appearance of
noncommutative geometries in the description of intersecting D-branes of
differing dimensions, such as D-strings ending on a D3- or D5-brane. We also
describe the related physics of giant gravitons.
