  In this series of lectures I present a review of the geometric structures of
supergravity in diverse dimensions mostly relevant to p-brane physics and to
pinpoint the correspondence between the macroscopic and microscopic description
of branes. In particular I review duality transformations, coset manifold
structures and the general steps involved by the process of gauging
supergravity lagrangians both with respect to compact, non compact and non
semisimple groups. I focus specifically on the issue of the Domain Wall field
theory correspondence and its relation with the gaugings of supergravity in p+2
dimensions. A complete review of the geometries involved by D=5, N=2
supergravity and of its most general form is given with emphasis on the problem
of finding smooth supersymmetric realizations of the Randall Sundrum scenarios.
I also give a general review of the algebraic machinery involved by the
Solvable Lie algebra description of the scalar manifolds of supergravity and I
emphasize its distinguished role in pinpointing the superstring interpretation
of supergravity p brane solutions and the macroscopic/microscopic
correspondence.
