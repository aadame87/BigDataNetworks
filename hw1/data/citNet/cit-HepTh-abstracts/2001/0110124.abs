  We examine string field algebra which is generated by star product in
Witten's string field theory including ghost part. We perform calculations
using oscillator representation consistently. We construct wedge like states in
ghost part and investigate algebras among them. As a by-product we have
obtained some solutions of vacuum string field theory. We also discuss some
problems about identity state. We hope these calculations will be useful for
further investigation of Witten type string field theory.
