  The RR Page charges for the D(2p+1)-branes with B-field in type IIB
supergravity are constructed consistently from brane source currents. The
resulting Page charges are B-independent in the nontrivial and intricate way.
It is found that in topologically trivial B-field the Page charge is conserved,
but in the topologically nontrivial B-field it is no longer to be conserved,
instead there is a jump between two Page charges defined in each patch, and we
interpret this jump as Hanany-Witten effect.
