  We discuss dual formulations of D-brane intersections. The duality is between
world volume field theories of different dimensionalities which both describe
the same D-brane configuration but are valid in complementary regions of
parameter space. We discuss the duality in terms of bion configurations
involving D-strings orthogonally intersecting both D3-branes and D5-branes.
