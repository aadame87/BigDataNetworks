  We present a full two-loop O(g^6) perturbative field theoretic calculation of
the expectation value of two circular Maldacena-Wilson loops in D=4 N=4
supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory. It is demonstrated that, after taking into
account very subtle cancellations of bulk and boundary divergences, the result
is completely finite without any renormalization. As opposed to previous lower
order calculations existing in the literature, internal vertex diagrams no
longer cancel identically and lead to subleading corrections to the dominant
ladder diagrams. Taking limits, we proceed to extract the two-loop static
potential corresponding to two infinite anti-parallel lines. Our result gives
some evidence that the existing strong-coupling calculations using the AdS/CFT
conjecture might sum up the full set of large N planar Feynman diagrams.
