  A special class of solutions to the generalised WDVV equations related to a
finite set of covectors is considered. We describe the geometric conditions
($\vee$-conditions) on such a set which are necessary and sufficient for the
corresponding function to satisfy the generalised WDVV equations. These
conditions are satisfied for all Coxeter systems but there are also other
examples discovered in the theory of the generalised Calogero-Moser systems. As
a result some new solutions for the generalized WDVV equations are found.
