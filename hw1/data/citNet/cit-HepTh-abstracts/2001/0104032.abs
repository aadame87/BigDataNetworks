  At large N, a field theory and its orbifolds (given by projecting out some of
its fields) share the same planar graphs. If the parent-orbifold relation
continues even nonperturbatively, then properties such as confinement and
chiral symmetry breaking will appear in both parent and orbifold. N=1
supersymmetric Yang-Mills has many nonsupersymmetric orbifolds which resemble
QCD. A nonperturbative parent-orbifold relation predicts many surprising
effects, exactly valid at large N, and expected to suffer only mild 1/N
corrections. These include degeneracies among bosonic hadrons and exact
predictions for domain wall tensions. Other predictions are valid even when
supersymmetry in the parent is broken. Since these theories are QCD-like,
simulation is possible, so these predictions may be numerically tested. The
method also relates wide classes of nonsupersymmetric theories.
