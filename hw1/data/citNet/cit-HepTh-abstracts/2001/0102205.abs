  In three-dimensional QED, which is analyzed in the 1/$N$ expansion, we obtain
a sufficient and necessary condition for a nontrivial solution of the
Dyson-Schwinger equation to be chiral symmetry breaking solution. In the
derivation, a normalization condition of the Goldstone bound state is used. It
is showed that the existent analytical solutions satisfy this condition.
