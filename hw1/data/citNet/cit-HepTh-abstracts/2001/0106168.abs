  Attention has been recently called upon the fact that the weak and null
energy conditions and the second law of thermodynamics are violated in wormhole
solutions of Einstein's theory with classical, nonminimally coupled, scalar
fields as material source. It is shown that the discussion is only meaningful
when ambiguities in the definitions of stress-energy tensor and energy density
of a nonminimally coupled scalar are resolved. The three possible approaches
are discussed with emphasis on the positivity of the respective energy
densities and covariant conservation laws. The root of the ambiguities is
traced to the energy localization problem for the gravitational field.
