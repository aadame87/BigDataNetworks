  In a recent paper hep-th/0008140 by E. Verlinde, an interesting formula has
been put forward, which relates the entropy of a conformal formal field in
arbitrary dimensions to its total energy and Casimir energy. This formula has
been shown to hold for the conformal field theories that have AdS duals in the
cases of AdS Schwarzschild black holes and AdS Kerr black holes. In this paper
we further check this formula with various black holes with AdS asymptotics.
For the hyperbolic AdS black holes, the Cardy-Verlinde formula is found to hold
if we choose the ``massless'' black hole as the ground state, but in this case,
the Casimir energy is negative. For the AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in
arbitrary dimensions and charged black holes in D=5, D=4, and D=7 maximally
supersymmetric gauged supergravities, the Cardy-Verlinde formula holds as well,
but a proper internal energy which corresponds to the mass of supersymmetric
backgrounds must be subtracted from the total energy. It is failed to rewrite
the entropy of corresponding conformal field theories in terms of the
Cardy-Verlinde formula for the AdS black holes in the Lovelock gravity.
