  We give the bare-bone description of the quasitriangular chiral WZW model for
the particular choice of the Lu-Weinstein-Soibelman Drinfeld double of the
affine Kac-Moody group. The symplectic structure of the model and its
Poisson-Lie symmetry are completely characterized by two $r$-matrices with
spectral parameter. One of them is ordinary and trigonometric and characterizes
the $q$-current algebra. The other is dynamical and elliptic (in fact Felder's
one) and characterizes the braiding of $q$-primary fields.
