  Low-energy effective M-theory (11d supergravity or 11d SUSY theory) is
considered in 11d flat or AdS background. After orbifold compactification of
eleventh dimension one gets flat 10d brane at non-zero temperature. Quantum
effective potential (free energy at low-temperature approximation) is
calculated on such brane with account of only lowest mass from Kaluza-Klein
modes. Such effective potential may stabilize the radius of 11th dimension
(radion stabilization) as it is demonstrated explicitly.
