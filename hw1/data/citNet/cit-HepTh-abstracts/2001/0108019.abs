  We consider the effects of homogeneous Dirichlet's boundary conditions on two
infinite parallel plane surfaces separated by a small distance {\it a}. We find
that although spontaneous symmetry breaking does not occur for the theory of a
massless, quartically self-interacting real scalar field, the theory becomes a
theory of a massive scalar field.
