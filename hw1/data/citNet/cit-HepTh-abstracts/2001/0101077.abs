  We consider the behaviour of neutral non-BPS branes probed by scalars and
gravitons. We show that the naked singularity of the non-BPS branes is a {\it
repulson} absorbing no incoming radiation. The naked singularity is surrounded
by an infinite potential well breaking the unitarity of the scattering
S-matrix. We compute the absorption cross section which is infrared divergent.
In particular this confirms that gravity does not decouple for the non-BPS
branes.
