  The evaluation of field theoretic correlators at strong couplings is
especially interesting in the light of recently discovered string/field theory
correspondences. We present a calculation of the stress-tensor correlator in
N=1 SYM theory in 2+1 dimensions. We calculate this object numerically with the
method of supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ) at large N_c.
For small distances we reproduce the conformal field theory result with the
correlator behaving like 1/r^6. In the large r limit the correlator is
determined by the (massless) BPS states of the theory. We find a critical value
of the coupling where the correlator goes to zero in this limit. This critical
coupling is shown to grow linearly with the square root of the transverse
momentum resolution.
