  The problem of consistent formulation of the correspondence principle in
quantum gravity is considered. The usual approach based on the use of the
two-particle scattering amplitudes is shown to be in disagreement with the
classical result of General Relativity given by the Schwarzschild solution. It
is shown also that this approach fails to describe whatever non-Newtonian
interactions of macroscopic bodies. An alternative interpretation of the
correspondence principle is given directly in terms of the effective action.
Gauge independence of the \hbar^0 part of the one-loop radiative corrections to
the gravitational form factors of the scalar particle is proved, justifying the
interpretation proposed. Application to the black holes is discussed.
