  We consider the CFT that arises from the D1-D5 system in the presence of a
constant background gauge potential which couples to the R-charge of the
theory: this potential effectively changes the periodicities of the fermions.
By the AdS/CFT correspondence, the effect of this connnection should be
obtained by finding a smooth solution to the vector field in AdS space which
couples to the constant mode of the R-current in the CFT. We investigate such
solutions for small values of the connection, and contrast these with
spacetimes which have `Wilson lines for the bulk ' -- spacetimes that are
locally AdS times a sphere but have a global deformation. The latter class are
in general singular spacetimes. We comment on some aspects of the recently
found geometries corresponding to the D1-D5 state with angular momentum,
observing relations between scales in the microscopic theory and scales in the
geometry.
