  Superconformal transformations are derived for the $\N=2,4 supermultiplets
corresponding to the simplest chiral primary operators. These are applied to
two, three and four point correlation functions. When $\N=4$, results are
obtained for the three point function of various descendant operators,
including the energy momentum tensor and SU(4) current. For both $\N=2$ or 4
superconformal identities are derived for the functions of the two conformal
invariants appearing in the four point function for the chiral primary
operator. These are solved in terms of a single arbitrary function of the two
conformal invariants and one or three single variable functions. The results
are applied to the operator product expansion using the exact formula for the
contribution of an operator in the operator product expansion in four
dimensions to a scalar four point function. Explicit expressions representing
exactly the contribution of both long and possible short supermultiplets to the
chiral primary four point function are obtained. These are applied to give the
leading perturbative and large N corrections to the scale dimensions of long
supermultiplets.
