  We show the instability of two self-tuning brane world models with gauge
invariant linear perturbation theory. This general method confirms a known
instability of the original model with vanishing bulk potential. We also show
the dynamical instability of a recently proposed self-tuning "smooth" brane
model and its limit, the Randall-Sundrum model. Astonishingly, we also find
instability under purely gravitational perturbations.
