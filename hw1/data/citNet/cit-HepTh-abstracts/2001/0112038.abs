Authors: D. V. Gal'tsov
Comments: A written version of the talk given at the 16th International
  Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation, held on July 15-21, 2001,
  in Durban, South Africa. Latex error on the title page corrected. New

\\
  Recent progress in the study of solitons and black holes in non-Abelian field
theories coupled to gravity is reviewed. New topics include gravitational
binding of monopoles, black holes with non-trivial topology, Lue-Weinberg
bifurcation, asymptotically AdS lumps, solutions to the Freedman-Schwarz model
with applications to holography, non-Abelian Born-Infeld solutions
