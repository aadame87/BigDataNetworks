  We consider the dynamics of a viscous cosmological fluid in the generalized
Randall-Sundrum model for an isotropic brane. To describe the dissipative
effects we use the Israel-Hiscock-Stewart full causal thermodynamic theory. In
the limiting case of a stiff cosmological fluid with pressure equal to the
energy density, the general solution of the field equations can be obtained in
an exact parametric form for a cosmological fluid with constant bulk viscosity
and with a bulk viscosity coefficient proportional to the square root of the
energy density, respectively. The obtained solutions describe generally
non-inflationary brane worlds, starting from a singular state. During this
phase of evolution the comoving entropy of the Universe is an increasing
function of time, and thus a large amount of entropy is created in the brane
world due to viscous dissipative processes.
