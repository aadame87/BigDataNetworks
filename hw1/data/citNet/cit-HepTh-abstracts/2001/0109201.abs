  We present a derivation of Hawking radiation based on canonical quantization
of a massless scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole
using Lemaitre coordinates and show that in these coordinates the Hamiltonian
of the massless field is time-dependent. This result exhibits the non-static
nature of the problem and shows it is better to talk about the time dependence
of physical quantities rather than the existence of a time-independent vacuum
state for the massless field. We then demonstrate the existence of Hawking
radiation and show that despite the fact that the flux looks thermal to an
outside observer, the time evolution of the massless field is unitary.
