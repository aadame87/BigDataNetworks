  The formulation of 2d-dilaton theories, like spherically reduced Einstein
gravity, is greatly facilitated in a formulation as a first order theory with
nonvanishing bosonic torsion. This is especially also true at the quantum
level. The interpretation of superextensions as graded Poisson sigma models is
found to cover generically all possible 2d supergravities. Superfields and thus
superfluous auxiliary fields are avoided altogether. The procedure shows that
generalizations of bosonic 2d models are highly ambiguous.
