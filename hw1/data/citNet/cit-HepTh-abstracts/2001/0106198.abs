  We perform the group analysis of Witten's equations of motion for a particle
moving in the presence of a magnetic monopole, and also when constrained to
move on the surface of a sphere, which is the classical Wess-Zumino-Witten
model. We also consider variations of this model. Our analysis gives the
generators of the corresponding Lie point symmetries. The Lie symmetry
corresponding to Kepler's third law is obtained in two related examples.
