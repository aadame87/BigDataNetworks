  Hawking radiation emanating from two-dimensional charged and uncharged
dilatonic black holes - dimensionally reduced from (2+1) spinning and spinless,
respectively, BTZ black holes - is viewed as a tunnelling process. Two
dimensional dilatonic black holes (AdS(2) included) are treated as dynamical
backgrounds in contrast to the standard methodology where the background
geometry is fixed when evaluating Hawking radiation. This modification to the
geometry gives rise to a nonthermal part in the radiation spectrum. Nonzero
temperature of the extremal two-dimensional charged black hole is found.
 The Bekenstein-Hawking area formula is easily derived for these dynamical
geometries.
