  We formulate a method of performing non-perturbative calculations in quantum
field theory, based upon a derivative expansion of the exact renormalization
group. We then proceed to apply this method to the calculation of critical
exponents for three dimensional O(N) symmetric theory. Finally we discuss how
the approximation scheme manages to reproduce some exactly known solutions in
critical phenomena.
