  For renormalizable models a method is presented to unambiguously compute the
energy that is carried by localized field configurations (solitons). A
variational approach for the total energy is utilized to search for soliton
configurations. As an example a 1+1 dimensional model is considered. The
quantum energy of configurations that are translationally invariant for a
subset of coordinates is discussed.
