  We give matrix and supergravity descriptions of type IIA F-strings polarizing
into cylindrical D2 branes. When a RR four-form field strength F_4 is turned on
in a supersymmetric fashion (with 4 supercharges), a complete analysis of the
solutions reveals the existence of a moduli space of F1 -> D2 polarizations
(Caesar) for some fractional strengths of the perturbation, and of no
polarization whatsoever (nihil) for all other strengths of the perturbation.
This is a very intriguing phenomenon, whose physical implications we can only
speculate about. In the matrix description of the polarization we use the
Non-Abelian Born-Infeld action in an extreme regime, where the commutators of
the fields are much larger than 1. The validity of the results we obtain,
provides a direct confirmation of this action, although is does not confirm or
disprove the symmetrized trace prescription.
