  The gauge invariance of cubic open superstring field theory is considered in
a framework of level truncation, and applications to the tachyon condensation
problem are discussed. As it is known, in the bosonic case the Feynman-Siegel
gauge is not universal within the level truncation method. We explore another
gauge that is more suitable for calculation of the tachyon potential for
fermionic string at level (2,6). We show that this new gauge has no
restrictions on the region of its validity at least at this level.
