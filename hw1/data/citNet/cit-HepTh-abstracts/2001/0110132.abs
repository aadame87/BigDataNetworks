  We consider five dimensional theories compactified on the orbifold S^1/Z_2
and prove that spontaneous local supersymmetry breaking by Wilson lines and by
the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism are equivalent. Wilson breaking is triggered by
the SU(2)_R symmetry which is gauged in off-shell N=2 supergravity by auxiliary
fields. The super-Higgs mechanism disposes of the would-be Goldstinos which are
absorbed by the gravitinos to become massive. The breaking survives in the flat
limit, where we decouple all gravitational interactions, and the theory becomes
softly broken global supersymmetry.
