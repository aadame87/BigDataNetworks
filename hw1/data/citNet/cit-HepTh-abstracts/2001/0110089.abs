  We have studied scalar potentials V of gauged N=8,4,2 supergravities in d=4.
Extrema of these potentials may correspond to de Sitter, anti de Sitter and
Minkowski vacua. All de Sitter extrema that we have studied correspond to
unstable maximum/saddle points with negative curvature |V''|=2V for the fields
canonically normalized at the extremum. This is equivalent to the relation
|m^2| =|R|/2 = 6H^2 for the tachyonic mass m, the curvature scalar R, and the
Hubble constant H. This prevents the use of de Sitter extrema for slow-roll
inflation in the early universe, which would require |V''| \ll V . Moreover, in
all models that we were able to analyse the potential is unbounded from below.
On the other hand, barring the question how realistic such models could be, one
can use them for the description of the accelerated expansion of the universe
at the present epoch. This is related to a novel possibility of the fast-roll
inflation with |V''| > V . We also display some potentials that have flat
directions with vanishing cosmological constant, and discuss their possible
cosmological implications.
