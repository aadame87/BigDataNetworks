  We study the thermodynamic relations of conformal field theories (CFTs),
which are holographically dual to anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild bulk
space-times. A Cardy-Verlinde formula is derived thermodynamically for CFTs
living on S^n x R with S^n having an arbitrary radius. The Hawking-Page phase
transition of the CFT is described using Landau's theory of phase transitions,
and an alternative derivation of the Cardy-Verlinde formula is presented. The
condensate in the high temperature phase is identified as being composed of
radiational matter.
