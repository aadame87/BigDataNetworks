Title: Gauge anomalies and the Witten-Seiberg correspondence for N=1
  supersymmetric theories on noncommutative spaces
Authors: L.O.Chekhov and A.K.Khizhnyakov
Comments: 5 pages, no figures
\\
  The explicit form of non-Abelian noncommutative supersymmetric (SUSY) chiral
anomaly is calculated, the Wess-Zumino consistency condition is verified and
the correspondence of the Yang-Mills sector to the previously obtained results
is shown. We generalize the Seiberg-Witten map to the case of N=1 SUSY
Yang-Mills theory and calculations up to the second order in the
noncommutativity parameter are done.
