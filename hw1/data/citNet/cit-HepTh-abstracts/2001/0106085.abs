Title: A New Measure, Scale Invariance and See Saw Cosmology
Authors: E.I.Guendelman
Comments: Contribution to Pascos 2001
\\
  The cosmological constant problem and the possibility of obtaining a see saw
cosmological effect, where the effective vacuum energy is highly suppressed by
the existence of a large scale is investigated in the context of
scale-invariant, generally covariant theory. Scale invariance is considered in
the context of a gravitational theory where the action, in the first order
formalism, is of the form $S = \int L_{1} \Phi d^4x$ + $\int
L_{2}\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ where $\Phi$ is a density built out of degrees of freedom
independent of the metric.
