  We consider Dirac's free electron theory on the first quantized level. We
decompose its canonical spin current \'a la Gordon and find a conserved
``Gordon spin'' current which turns out to be equivalent to the
Hilgevoord-Wouthuysen spin. We can conclude therefrom that the Gordon-type
decomposition mentioned above corresponds to a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation
which transforms the Dirac wave function from the conventional Dirac-Pauli to
the Newton-Wigner representation.
