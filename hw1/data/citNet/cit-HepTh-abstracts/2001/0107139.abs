  We discuss the dynamical situation which arises in a local quantum field
theory after renormalization. By using the example of the three-dimensional
theory of a neutral scalar field interacting through the quartic coupling, we
show that after renormalization the dynamics of a theory is governed by a
generalized dynamical equation with a nonlocal interaction operator. It is
shown that the generalized dynamical equation allows one to formulate this
theory in an ultraviolet-finite way.
