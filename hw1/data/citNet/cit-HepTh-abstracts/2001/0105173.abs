  We study the features of the vacuum of the harmonic oscillator in the Moyal
quantization. The vacuums with and without using the normal ordering look
different. The vacuum without the normal ordering is shown to be expressed
using the Weyl ordering. The Weyl ordered vacuum is then compared with the
normal ordered vacuum, and the implication of the difference between them is
discussed.
