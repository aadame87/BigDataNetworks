  We test the consistency of the use of a noncommutative theory description for
charged particles in a strong magnetic field, by deriving the induced
Chern-Simons (CS) term for an external Abelian gauge field in 2+1 dimensions.
In this description, the system is modeled by a noncommutative matter field
coupled to a U(1) noncommutative gauge field, related to the original,
commutative one, by a Seiberg-Witten transformation. We show that an Abelian CS
term for the commutative gauge field is indeed induced, and moreover that it
matches the result of previous commutative field theory calculations.
