  Old fashioned duality used to derive the closed string field theory for
magnetic vortex from the gauge theory with Higgs scalar, is applied to the
string theories. The bosonic sring theory coupled to the Kalb-Ramond 2-form
field is dually transformed to the 6-brane theory coupled to the 7-form field.
The old fashioned dual transformation is also examined for the Type IIA and IIB
superstrings. For this study, the string field theoretical treatment of the
bosonic and fermionic strings is developped based on the reparametrization
invariant formulation of strings by Marshall and Ramond. In order for the
self-duality of the Type IIB superstring to appear, the following dual
correspondence may happen: the dual transformation of the NS-NS field
functional is the bosonization of the R-R one.
