  We study the general form of the *-commutator treated as a deformation of the
Poisson bracket on the Grassman algebra. We show that, up to a similarity
transformation, there are other deformations of the Poisson bracket in addition
to the Moyal commutator (one at even and one at odd n, n is the number of the
generators of the Grassman algebra) which are not reduced to the Moyal
commutator by a similarity transformation.
