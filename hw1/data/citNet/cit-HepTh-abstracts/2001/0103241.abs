  We discuss the brane cosmology in the 5D anti de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom
(AdSRN$_5$) spacetime. A brane with the tension $\sigma$ is defined as the edge
of an AdSRN$_5$ space with mass $M$ and charge $Q$. In this case we get the
CFT-radiation term $(\rho_{CFT})$ from $M$ and the charged dust
$(-\rho^2_{cd})$ from $Q^2$ in the Friedmann-like equation.
 However, this equation is not justified because it contains $\rho_{cd}^2$-term
with the negative sign. This is unconventional in view of the standard
cosmology. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a localized dust
matter which satisfies $P_{dm}=0$. If $\rho_{dm}=\fr{\sqrt 3}{2}\rho_{cd}$, the
unwanted $-\rho_{cd}^2$ is cancelled against $\rho_{dm}^2$ and thus one
recovers a standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with CFT-radiation and
dust matter. For the stiff matter consideration, we can set $\rho_{csti}\sim
Q^2$ with the negative sign. Here we introduce a massless scalar which plays
the role of a stiff matter with $P_{sca}=\rho_{sca}$ to cancel $-\rho_{csti}$.
In this case, however, we find a mixed version of the standard and brane
cosmologies.
