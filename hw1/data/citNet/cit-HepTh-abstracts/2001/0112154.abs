  We describe a supersymmetric RG flow between conformal fixed points of a
two-dimensional quantum field theory as an analytic domain wall solution of the
three-dimensional SO(4) x SO(4) gauged supergravity. Its ultraviolet fixed
point is an N=(4,4) superconformal field theory related, through the double
D1-D5 system, to theories modeling the statistical mechanics of black holes.
The flow is driven by a relevant operator of conformal dimension \Delta=3/2
which breaks conformal symmetry and breaks supersymmetry down to N=(1,1), and
sends the theory to an infrared conformal fixed point with half the central
charge.
  Using the supergravity description, we compute counterterms, one-point
functions and fluctuation equations for inert scalars and vector fields,
providing the complete framework to compute two-point correlation functions of
the corresponding operators throughout the flow in the two-dimensional quantum
field theory. This produces a toy model for flows of N=4 super Yang-Mills
theory in 3+1 dimensions, where conformal-to-conformal flows have resisted
analytical solution.
