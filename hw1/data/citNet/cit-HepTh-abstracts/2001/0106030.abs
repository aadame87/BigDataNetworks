  We give a simple proof of why there is a Matrix theory approximation for a
membrane shaped like an arbitrary Riemann surface. As corollaries, we show that
noncompact membranes cannot be approximated by matrices and that the Poisson
algebra on any compact phase space is U(infinity). The matrix approximation
does not appear to work properly in theories such as IIB string theory or
bosonic membrane theory where there is no conserved 3-form charge to which the
membranes couple.
