  We point out that the leading infrared singular terms in the effective
actions of noncommutative gauge theories arising from nonplanar loop diagrams
have a natural interpretation in terms of the matrix model (operator)
formulation of these theories. In this formulation (for maximal spatial
noncommutativity), noncommutative space arises as a configuration of an
infinite number of D-particles. We show that the IR singular terms correspond
to instantaneous linear potentials between these D-particles resulting from the
zero point energies of fluctuations about this background. For theories with
fewer fermionic than bosonic degrees of freedom, such as pure noncommutative
gauge theory, the potential is attractive and renders the theory unstable. With
more fermionic than bosonic degrees of freedom, the potential is repulsive and
we argue that the theory is stable, though oddly behaved.
