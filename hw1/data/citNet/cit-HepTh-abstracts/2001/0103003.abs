  This paper reports the investigation of a matrix model via super Lie algebra,
following the proposal of L. Smolin. We consider the osp(1|32,R) nongauged
matrix model and gl(1|32,R) gauged matrix model, especially paying attention to
the supersymmetry and the relationship with IKKT model. This paper is based on
the collaboration with the collaboration with S.Iso, H.Kawai and Y.Ohwashi.
