  A (1 + d)-dimensional thick "brane world" model with varying Lambda-term is
considered. The model is generalized to the case of a chain of Ricci-flat
internal spaces when the matter source is an anisotropic perfect fluid. The
"horizontal" part of potential is obtained in the Newtonian approximation. In
the multitemporal case (with a Lambda-term) a set of equations for potentials
is presented.
