  We study some dynamical aspects of gauge theories on noncommutative tori. We
show that Morita duality, combined with the hypothesis of analyticity as a
function of the noncommutativity parameter Theta, gives information about
singular large-N limits of ordinary U(N) gauge theories, where the large-rank
limit is correlated with the shrinking of a two-torus to zero size. We study
some non-perturbative tests of the smoothness hypothesis with respect to Theta
in theories with and without supersymmetry. In the supersymmetric case this is
done by adapting Witten's index to the present situation, and in the
nonsupersymmetric case by studying the dependence of energy levels on the
instanton angle. We find that regularizations which restore supersymmetry at
high energies seem to preserve Theta-smoothness whereas nonsupersymmetric
asymptotically free theories seem to violate it. As a final application we use
Morita duality to study a recent proposal of Susskind to use a noncommutative
Chern-Simons gauge theory as an effective description of the Fractional Hall
Effect. In particular we obtain an elegant derivation of Wen's topological
order.
