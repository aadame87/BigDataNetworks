Title: Gauge Field on Brane in M-atrix Theory
Authors: Takeshi Inagaki
Comments: 3 pages
\\
  In this ultra short note, gauge field propagation in D-brane configuration of
M theory in the BFSS matrix formulation is considered. Noncommutativity of the
space plays a key role for appearance of gauge fields as physical degrees of
freedom.
