  We apply quantum group methods for noncommutative geometry to the $Z_2\times
Z_2$ lattice to obtain a natural Dirac operator on this discrete space. This
then leads to an interpretation of the Higgs fields as the discrete part of
spacetime in the Connes-Lott formalism for elementary particle Lagrangians. The
model provides a setting where both the quantum groups and the Connes approach
to noncommutative geometry can be usefully combined, with some of Connes'
axioms, notably the first-order condition, replaced by algebraic methods based
on the group structure. The noncommutative geometry has nontrivial cohomology
and moduli of flat connections, both of which we compute.
