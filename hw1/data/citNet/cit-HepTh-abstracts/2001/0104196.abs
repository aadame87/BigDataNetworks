  The coordinate transformations which establish the direct relationship
between the actions of linear and nonlinear realizations of supermembranes are
proposed. It is shown that the Rocek-Tseytlin constraint known in the framework
of the linear realization of the theory is simply equivalent to a limit of a
"pure" nonlinear realization in which the field describing the massive mode of
the supermembrane puts to zero.
