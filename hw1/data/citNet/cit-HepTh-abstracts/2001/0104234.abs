  We discuss a simplified method for computing trace anomalies in d=6 and d<6
dimensions. It is known that in the quantum mechanical approach trace anomalies
in d dimensions are given by a (1+d/2)-loop computation in an auxiliary 1d
sigma model with arbitrary geometry. We show how one can obtain the same
information using a simpler d/2-loop calculation on an arbitrary geometry
supplemented by a (1+d/2)-loop calculation on the simplified geometry of a
maximally symmetric space.
