  We consider a brane universe in an asymptotically de Sitter background
spacetime of arbitrary dimensionality. In particular, the bulk spacetime is
described by a ``topological de Sitter'' solution, which has recently been
investigated by Cai, Myung and Zhang. In the current study, we begin by showing
that the brane evolution is described by Friedmann-like equations for radiative
matter. Next, on the basis of the dS/CFT correspondence, we identify the
thermodynamic properties of the brane universe. We then demonstrate that many
(if not all) of the holographic aspects of analogous AdS-bulk scenarios
persist. These include a (generalized) Cardy-Verlinde form for the CFT entropy
and various coincidences when the brane crosses the cosmological horizon.
