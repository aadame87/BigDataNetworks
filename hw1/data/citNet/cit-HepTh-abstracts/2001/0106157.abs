Title: Map of Witten's * to Moyal's *
Authors: Itzhak Bars
Comments: Revised version contains a discussion of midpoint ambiguity and its
  relation to odd versus even modes in the split string formalism. Also a
  generating formula for explicit computations is included. Signs and powers in
  eqs.53-57 are corrected (wrong in published version in Phys. Lett.)

  It is shown that Witten's star product in string field theory, defined as the
overlap of half strings, is equivalent to the Moyal star product involving the
relativistic phase space of even string modes. The string field A(x[\sigma])
can be rewritten as a phase space field of the even modes $x_{2n},x_{0},
p_{2n}$ where $x_{2n}$ are the positions of the even string modes, and $p_{2n}$
are related to the Fourier space of the odd modes $x_{2n+1}$ up to a linear
transformation. The $p_{2n}$ play the role of conjugate momenta for the even
modes $x_{2n}$ under the string star product. The split string formalism is
used in the intermediate steps to establish the map from Witten's star-product
to Moyal's star-product. An ambiguity related to the midpoint in the split
string formalism is clarified by considering odd or even modding for the split
string modes, and its effect in the Moyal star product formalism is discussed.
The noncommutative geometry defined in this way is technically similar to the
one that occurs in noncommutative field theory, but it includes the timelike
components of the string modes, and is Lorentz invariant. This map could be
useful to extend the computational methods and concepts from noncommutative
field theory to string field theory and vice-versa.
