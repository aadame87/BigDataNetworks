  We study the optimisation of exact renormalisation group (ERG) flows. We
explain why the convergence of approximate solutions towards the physical
theory is optimised by appropriate choices of the regularisation. We consider
specific optimised regulators for bosonic and fermionic fields and compare the
optimised ERG flows with generic ones. This is done up to second order in the
derivative expansion at both vanishing and non-vanishing temperature. We find
that optimised flows at finite temperature factorise. This corresponds to the
disentangling of thermal and quantum fluctuations. A similar factorisation is
found at second order in the derivative expansion. The corresponding optimised
flow for a ``proper-time renormalisation group'' is also provided to leading
order in the derivative expansion.
