  We show that a pure gauge theory in higher dimensions may lead to an
effective lower-dimensional theory with massive vector field, broken gauge
symmetry and no fundamental Higgs boson. The mechanism we propose employs the
localization of a vector field on a lower-dimensional defect. No non-zero
expectation values of the vector field components along extra dimensions are
required. New possibilities for the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem are
discussed.
