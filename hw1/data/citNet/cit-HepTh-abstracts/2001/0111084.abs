  We solve for the spectrum and eigenfunctions of Dirac operator on the sphere.
The eigenvalues are nonzero whole numbers. The eigenfunctions are two-component
spinors which may be classified by representations of the SU(2) group with
half-integer angular momenta. They are not the conventional spherical spinors
but special linear combinations of those.
