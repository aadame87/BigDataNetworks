  The quantum-induced dilatonic brane world (New Brane World) is created by
brane CFT quantum effects (giving effective brane tension) in accordance with
AdS/CFT set-up which also defines surface term. Considering the bosonic sector
of 5d gauged supergravity with single scalar and taking the boundary action as
predicted by supersymmetry, the possibility to supersymmetrize dilatonic New
Brane World is discussed. It is demonstrated that for a number of
superpotentials the flat SUSY dilatonic brane-world (with dynamically induced
brane dilaton) or quantum-induced de Sitter dilatonic brane-world (not Anti-de
Sitter one) where SUSY is broken by the quantum effects occurs. The analysis of
graviton perturbations indicates that gravity is localized on such branes.
