  Two- and three-point correlation functions of arbitrary protected operators
are constructed in N=4 SYM using analytic superspace methods. The OPEs of two
chiral primary multiplets are given. It is shown that the $n$-point functions
of protected operators for $n\leq4$ are invariant under $U(1)_Y$ and it is
argued that this implies that the two- and three-point functions are not
renormalised. It is shown explicitly how unprotected operators can be
accommodated in the analytic superspace formalism in a way which is fully
compatible with analyticity. Some new extremal correlators are exhibited.
