  We study supersymmetry breaking effects in N=1 SYM from the point of view of
quantum effective actions. Restrictions on the geometry of the effective
potential from superspace are known to be problematic in quantum effective
actions, where explicit supersymmetry breaking can and must be studied. On the
other hand the true ground state can be determined from this effective action,
only. We study whether some parts of superspace geometry are still relevant for
the effective potential and discuss whether the ground states found this way
justify a low energy approximation based on this geometry. The answer to both
questions is negative: Essentially non-semiclassical effects change the
behavior of the auxiliary fields completely and demand for a new interpretation
of superspace geometry. These non-semiclassical effects can break
supersymmetry.
