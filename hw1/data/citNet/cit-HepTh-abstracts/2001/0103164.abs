  We study the second quantization of field theory on the q-deformed fuzzy
sphere for real q. This is performed using a path-integral over the modes,
which generate a quasiassociative algebra. The resulting models have a manifest
U_q(su(2)) symmetry with a smooth limit q -> 1, and satisfy positivity and
twisted bosonic symmetry properties. A systematic way to calculate n-point
correlators in perturbation theory is given. As examples, the 4-point
correlator for a free scalar field theory and the planar contribution to the
tadpole diagram in \phi^4 theory are computed. The case of gauge fields is also
discussed, as well as an operator formulation of scalar field theory in 2_q + 1
dimensions. An alternative, essentially equivalent approach using associative
techniques only is also presented. The proposed framework is not restricted to
2 dimensions.
