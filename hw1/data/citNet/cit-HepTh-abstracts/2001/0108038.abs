  We show that in a certain region of a negative coordinate axis, the
U(1amaharia) sector of the static dyonic solutions to the noncommutative U(4)
N=4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM) can be consistently decoupled from the SU(4) to {\it
all orders in the noncommutativity parameter}. We show the above decoupling in
two ways. First, we show the noncommutative dyon being the same as the
commutative dyon, is a consistent solution to noncommutative equations of
motion in that region of noncommutative space. Second, as an example of
decoupling of a non-null U(1) sector, we also obtain a family of solutions with
nontrivial U(1) components for {\it all} components of the gauge field in the
same region of noncommutative space. In both cases, the SU(4) and U(1)
components separately satisfy the equations of motion.
