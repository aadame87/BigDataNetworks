Title: Large B-Fields and Noncommutative Solitons
Authors: Jorge Moreno
Comments: 5 pages, latex, no figures, talk delivered at the `VIII Workshop on
  Particles and Fields', Zacatecas, Mexico; November 2001

  The purpose of this talk is to review a few issues concerning
noncommutativity arising from String Theory. In particular, it is shown how in
Type IIB Theory, the annihilation of a D3-\bar{D3} brane pair yields a
D1-string. This object, in the presence of a large B-field and fermions,
happens to be a complex noncommutative soliton endowed with superconductivity.
