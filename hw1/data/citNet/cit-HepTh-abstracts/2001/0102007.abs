  We discuss the Seiberg-Witten solution of the non-commutative
 N=2 U(N) SYM model. The solution is described in terms of the ordinary
Seiberg-Witten curve of the SU(N) theory plus an additional free U(1). Hence,
at the two-derivative approximation the theory flows to the ordinary
commutative theory in the infra-red (k<1/sqrt(theta)). In particular, the
center U(1) is free and it decouples from the other U(1)'s. In addition, no
UV/IR mixing is found.
