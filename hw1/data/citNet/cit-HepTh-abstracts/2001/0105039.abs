  The quark-monopole potential is computed at finite temperature in the context
of $AdS/CFT$ correspondence. It is found that the potential is invariant under
$g \to 1/g$ and $U_T \to U_T / g$. As in the quark-quark case there exists a
maximum separation between quark and monopole, and $L$-dependence of the
potential exhibits a bifurcation behavior. We find a functional relation
$dE_{QM}^{Reg} / dL = [(1/E_{(1,0)}^{Reg}(U_0))^2 +
(1/E_{(0,1)}^{Reg}(U_0))^2]^{-1/2}$ which is responsible for the bifurcation.
The remarkable property of this relation is that it makes a relation between
physical quantities defined at the $AdS$ boundary through a quantity defined at
the bulk. The physical implication of this relation for the existence of the
extra dimension is speculated.
