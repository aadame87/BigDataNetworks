  We present here a manifestly gauge invariant calculation of vacuum
polarization to fermions in the presence of a constant Maxwell and a constant
Kalb-Ramond field in four dimensions. The formalism is a generalisation of the
one used by Schwinger in his famous paper on gauge invariance and vacuum
polarization. We get an explicit expression for the vacuum polarization induced
effective Lagrangian for a constant Maxwell field interacting with a constant
Kalb-Ramond field. In the weak field limit we get the coupling between the
Maxwell field and the Kalb-Ramond field to be $(\tilde{H}.\tilde{F})^2$, where
${\tilde H}_{\mu}= {1\over
{3!}}\epsilon_{\mu\alpha\beta\lambda}H^{\alpha\beta\lambda}$ and $\tilde F$ is
the dual of $F_{\mu\nu}$.
