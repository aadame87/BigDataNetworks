  The convergence of the derivative expansion of the exact renormalisation
group is investigated via the computation of the beta function of massless
scalar lambda phi^4 theory. The derivative expansion of the Polchinski flow
equation converges at one loop for certain fast falling smooth cutoffs.
Convergence of the derivative expansion of the Legendre flow equation is
trivial at one loop, but also can occur at two loops and in particular
converges for an exponential cutoff.
