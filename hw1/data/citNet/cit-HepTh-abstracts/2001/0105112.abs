  We study quasinormal modes of massless scalar and fermion fields in the near
extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m black hole, and relate them to Choptuik scaling
form following a recently proposed analytic approach. For both massless cases,
quasinormal modes are shown to be proportional to the black hole horizon and
the Hawking temperature, and the critical exponents are the same, although for
the fermionic case there are two possible discrete quasinormal modes. In
addition, the critical exponent of the massive boson is also equivalent to that
of the massless case. Finally, we discuss quasinormal modes and critical
exponents in the other models, and obtain some different critical exponents
between massless boson and massive one.
