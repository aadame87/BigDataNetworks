  The method of nonlinear realizations is applied for the conformally invariant
description of the spinning particles in terms of geometrical quantities of the
parameter spaces of the one dimensional N - extended superconformal groups. We
develop the superspace approach to the cases of spin 0, 1/2, 1 particles and
describe the alternative component approach in the application to the spin-1/2
particle.
