  We find a one-parameter family of new G_2 holonomy metrics and demonstrate
that it can be extended to a two-parameter family. These metrics play an
important role as the supergravity dual of the large $N$ limit of four
dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills. We show that these G_2 holonomy metrics
describe the M-theory lift of the supergravity solution describing a collection
of D6-branes wrapping the supersymmetric three-cycle of the deformed conifold
geometry for any value of the string coupling constant.
