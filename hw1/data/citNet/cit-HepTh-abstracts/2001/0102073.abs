  The helicity flip of a spin-1/2 Dirac fermion interacting with a torsion-
field endowed with a pseudo-tensorial extension is analysed. Taking the torsion
to be represented by a Kalb-Ramond field, we show that there is a finite
amplitude for helicity flip for massive fermions. The lowest order contribution
is proportional to the pseudo-tensor term.
