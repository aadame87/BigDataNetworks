  Semiclassical Hamiltonian field theory is investigated from the axiomatic
point of view. A notion of a semiclassical state is introduced. An "elementary"
semiclassical state is specified by a set of classical field configuration and
quantum state in this external field. "Composed" semiclassical states viewed as
formal superpositions of "elementary" states are nontrivial only if the Maslov
isotropic condition is satisfied; the inner product of "composed" semiclassical
states is degenerate. The mathematical proof of Poincare invariance of
semiclassical field theory is obtained for "elementary" and "composed"
semiclassical states. The notion of semiclassical field is introduced; its
Poincare invariance is also mathematically proved.
