  In this note we discuss bound states of un- or meta-stable brane
configurations in various non-trivial (curved) backgrounds. We begin by
reviewing some known results concerning brane dynamics on group manifolds.
These are then employed to study condensation in cosets of the WZW model. While
the basic ideas are more general, our presentation focuses on parafermion
theories and, closely related, N=2 superconformal minimal models. We determine
the (non-commutative) low energy effective actions for all maximally symmetric
branes in a decoupling limit of the two theories. These actions are used to
show that the lightest branes can be regarded as elementary constituents for
all other maximally symmetric branes.
