  The covariant light-front equations have been solved exactly for a two
fermion system with different boson exchange ladder kernels. We present a
method to study the cutoff dependence of these equations and to determine
whether they need to be regularized or not. Results are presented for scalar
and pseudo-scalar exchange. This latter furthermore exhibits some strange
particularities which will be discussed.
