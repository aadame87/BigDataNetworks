  The well-known fact that classical automorphisms of (compactified) Minkowski
spacetime (Poincare or conformal trandsformations) also allow a natural
derivation/interpretation in the modular setting (in the operator-algebraic
sense of Tomita and Takesaki) of the algebraic formulation of QFT has an
interesting nontrivial chiral generalization to the diffeomorphisms of the
circle. Combined with recent ideas on algebraic (d-1)-dimensional lightfront
holography, these diffeomorphisms turn out to be images of ``fuzzy'' acting
groups in the original d-dimensional (massive) QFT. These actions do not
require any spacetime noncommutativity and are in complete harmony with
causality and localization principles. Their use tightens the relation with
kinematic chiral structures on the causal horizon and makes recent attempts to
explain the required universal structure of a possible future quantum
Bekenstein law in terms of Virasoro algebra structures more palatable.
