  A new configuration of non-abelian D1-branes growing into D5-branes is found.
This time the effect is triggered by a non-trivial electric field on the
world-volume of the D1-branes and a constant RR 4-form potential. Based on the
these configurations and other observations regarding non-abilean effective
actions, a new action for matrix string theory in non-trivial backgrounds is
conjectured. As an application we found that fundamental strings can grow into
Dp-branes, in particular by placing the strings in the background of a group of
near horizon D3-branes we found D5-branes. These types of configurations were
found from the supergravity point of view in previous works.
