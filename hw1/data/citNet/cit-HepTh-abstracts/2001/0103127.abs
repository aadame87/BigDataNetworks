  We describe the extension of the Wigner`s infinite-dimensional unitary
representations of Poincar\'{e} group to the case of $\kappa$-deformed
Poincar\'{e} group. We show that the corresponding coordinate wave functions on
noncommutative space-time are described by free field equations on
$\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space. The cases of Klein--Gordon, Dirac, Proca and
Maxwell fields are considered. Finally some aspects of second quantization are
also discussed.
