  We reconsider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino-Witten (SWZW) term in four
dimensions. It has been known that the manifestly supersymmetric form of the
SWZW term includes derivative terms on auxiliary fields, the highest components
of chiral superfields, and then we cannot eliminate them by their equations of
motion. We discuss a possibility for the elimination of such derivative terms
by adding total derivative terms. Although the most of derivative terms can be
eliminated as in this way, we find that all the derivative terms can be
canceled, if and only if an anomalous term in SWZW term vanishes. As a
byproduct, we find the first example of a higher derivative term free from such
a problem.
