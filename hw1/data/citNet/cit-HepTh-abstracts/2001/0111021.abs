  Principles of a new approach (binary geometrophysics) are presented to
construct the unified theory of spacetime and the familiar kinds of physical
interactions. Physically, the approach is a modified S-matrix theory involving
ideas of the multidimensional geometric models of physical interactions of
Kaluza-Klein's type as well as Fokker-Feynman's action-at-a-distance theory.
Mathematically, this is a peculiar binary geometry being described in algebraic
terms. In the present approach the binary geometry volume is a prototype of
three related notions: the S-matrix, the physical action (Lagrangian) of both
strong and electroweak interactions, and the multidimensional metric. A
transition from microworld geometrophysics to the conventional physical theory
in classical spacetime are characterized.
