  We propose a large N dual of 4d, N=1 supersymmetric, SU(N) Yang-Mills with
adjoint field \Phi and arbitrary superpotential W(\Phi). The field theory is
geometrically engineered via D-branes partially wrapped over certain cycles of
a non-trivial Calabi-Yau geometry. The large N, or low-energy, dual arises from
a geometric transition of the Calabi-Yau, where the branes have disappeared and
have been replaced by suitable fluxes. This duality yields highly non-trivial
exact results for the gauge theory. The predictions indeed agree with expected
results in cases where it is possible to use standard techniques for analyzing
the strongly coupled, supersymmetric gauge theories. Moreover, the proposed
large N dual provides a simpler and more unified approach for obtaining exact
results for this class of supersymmetric gauge theories.
