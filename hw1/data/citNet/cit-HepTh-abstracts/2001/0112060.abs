  The vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop in the dual representation is
calculated in the dual Higgs model with dual Dirac strings. It is shown that
the averaged value of the Wilson loop in the dual representation obeys the
area-law falloff. Quantum fluctuations of the dual-vector and the Higgs field
around Abrikosov flux lines induced by dual Dirac strings in a dual
superconducting vacuum and string shape fluctuations are taken into account.
