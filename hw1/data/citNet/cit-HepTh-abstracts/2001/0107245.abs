  Gauge symmetry breaking by boundary conditions on a manifold is known to be
equivalent to Wilson-line breaking through a background gauge field, and is
therefore spontaneous. These equivalent pictures are related by a non-periodic
gauge transformation. However, we find that boundary condition gauge symmetry
breaking on orbifolds is explicit; there is no gauge where all the breaking can
be attributed to a background gauge field. In the case of a five-dimensional
SU(5) grand unified theory on S^1/Z_2, the vacuum with gauge symmetry broken to
SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) and that with SU(5) preserved are completely disconnected:
there is no physical process which causes tunneling between the two. This
allows a certain localized explicit breaking of SU(5) on one of the orbifold
fixed points in the theory with SU(5) breaking. Split multiplets on this fixed
point are shown not to induce violations of unitarity in scattering amplitudes.
