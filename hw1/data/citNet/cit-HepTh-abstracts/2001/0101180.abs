  We determine the form factor expansion of the one-point functions in
integrable quantum field theory at finite temperature and find that it is
simpler than previously conjectured. We show that no singularities are left in
the final expression provided that the operator is local with respect to the
particles and argue that the divergences arising in the non-local case are
related to the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking on the cylinder. As a
specific application, we give the first terms of the low temperature expansion
of the one-point functions for the Ising model in a magnetic field.
