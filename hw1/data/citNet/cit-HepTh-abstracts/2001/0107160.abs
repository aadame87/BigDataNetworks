  We show that the SU(2)_0 WZNW model has a hidden OSp(2|2)_{-2} symmetry. Both
these theories are known to have logarithms in their correlation functions. We
also show that, like OSp(2|2)_{-2}, the logarithmic structure present in the
SU(2)_0 model is due to the underlying c=-2 sector. We also demonstrate that
the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of SU(2)_0 leads very directly to the
correlation functions of the c=-2 model. We also discuss some of the novel
boundary effects which can take place in this model.
