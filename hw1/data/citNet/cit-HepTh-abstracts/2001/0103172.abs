  At present an algebra of strongly interacting fields is unknown. In this
paper it is assumed that the operators of strongly nonlinear field can form a
non-associative algebra. It is shown that such algebra can be described as an
algebra of some pairs. The comparison of presented techniques with the Green's
functions method in the superconductivity theory is made. A possible
application to the QCD and High-T$_c$ superconductivity theory is discussed.
