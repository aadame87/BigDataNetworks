  The Bekenstein-Hawking black hole area entropy law suggests that the quantum
degrees of freedom of black holes may be realized as projections of quantum
states unto the event horizon of the black hole. In this paper, we provide
further evidence for this interpretation in the context of string theory. In
particular, we argue that increase in the quantum entropy due to the capture of
infalling fundamental strings appears in the form of horizon degrees of
freedom.
