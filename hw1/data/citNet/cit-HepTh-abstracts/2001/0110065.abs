  We study the supersymmetric GUT models where the supersymmetry and GUT gauge
symmetry can be broken by the discrete symmetry. First, with the ansatz that
there exist discrete symmetries in the branes' neighborhoods, we discuss the
general reflection $Z_2$ symmetries and GUT breaking on $M^4\times M^1$ and
$M^4\times M^1\times M^1$. In those models, the extra dimensions can be large
and the KK states can be set arbitrarily heavy. Second, considering the extra
space manifold is the annulus $A^2$ or disc $D^2$, we can define any $Z_n$
symmetry and break any 6-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric SU(M) models down to
the 4-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)^{M-4}$
models for the zero modes. In particular, there might exist the interesting
scenario on $M^4\times A^2$ where just a few KK states are light, while the
others are relatively heavy. Third, we discuss the complete global discrete
symmetries on $M^4\times T^2$ and study the GUT breaking.
