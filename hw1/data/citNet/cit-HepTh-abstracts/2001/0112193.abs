  We discuss D-branes on a line of conformal field theories connected by an
exact marginal deformation. The line contains an SU(2) WZW model and two
mutually T-dual SU(2)/U(1) cosets times a free boson. We find the D-branes
preserving a U(1) isometry, an F-flux quantization condition and conformal
invariance. Away from the SU(2) point a U(1) times U(1) symmetry is broken to
U(1) times Z_k, i.e. continuous rotations of branes are accompanied by
rotations along the branes. Requiring decoupling of the cosets from the free
boson at the endpoints of the deformation breaks the continuous rotation of
branes to Z_k. At the SU(2) point the full U(1) times U(1) symmetry is
restored. This suggests the occurrence of phase transitions for branes at
angles in the coset model, at a semiclassical level. We also discuss briefly
the orientifold planes along the deformation line.
