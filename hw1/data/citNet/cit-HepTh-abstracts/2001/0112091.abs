Title: Supersymmetric Harmonic Maps into Lie Groups
Authors: F. O'Dea (University of Texas at Austin)
Comments: LaTeX 2.09 using revtex.sty
\\
  We look at the supersymmetric generalization of harmonic maps into Lie
groups, known to physicists as the chiral model. Explicit solutions to the
equations are found and examined using Backlund transformations.
