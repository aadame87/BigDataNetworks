  The study of noncommutative solitons is greatly facilitated if the field
equations are integrable, i.e. result from a linear system. For the example of
a modified but integrable $U(n)$ sigma model in $2{+}1$ dimensions we employ
the dressing method to construct explicit multi-soliton configurations on
noncommutative~$\R^{2,1}$. These solutions, abelian and nonabelian, feature
exact time-dependence for any value of the noncommutativity parameter~$\th$ and
describe various lumps of finite energy in relative motion. We discuss their
scattering properties and prove asymptotic factorization for large times.
