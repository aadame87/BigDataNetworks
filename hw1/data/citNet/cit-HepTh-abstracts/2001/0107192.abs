  An exact time-dependent solution of field equations for the 3-d gauge field
model with a Chern-Simons (CS) topological mass is found. Limiting cases of
constant solution and solution with vanishing topological mass are considered.
After Lorentz boost, the found solution describes a massive nonlinear
non-abelian plane wave. For the more complicate case of gauge fields with CS
mass interacting with a Higgs field, the stochastic character of motion is
demonstrated.
