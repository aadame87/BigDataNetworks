  The present paper is based on the modified part of the review "Random
Dynamics and Multiple Point Model" by L.V.Laperashvili, H.B.Nielsen,
D.A.Ryzhikh and N.Stillits, in preparation for publication in Russian, which
contains the results of our joint activity with H.B.Nielsen concerning the
investigations of phase transitions in gauge theories. In this review we have
presented the main ideas of the Nielsen's Random Dynamics (RD) and his
achievements (with co-authors) in the Anti-Grand Unification Theory (AGUT) and
Multiple Point Model (MPM). We have considered also the theory of Scale
Relativity (SR) by L.Nottale, which has a lot in common with RD: both theories
lead to the discreteness of our space-time, giving rise to the new description
of physics at very small distances. In this paper we have demonstrated the
possibility of [SU(5)]$^3$ SUSY unification with superparticles of masses
$M\approx 10^{18.3}$ GeV and calculated its critical point -- critical value of
the inverse finestucture constant -- at $\alpha_{5,crit}^{-1} =
\alpha_5^{-1}(\mu_{Pl})\approx 34.0$ (close to $\alpha_{GUT}^{-1}\approx 34.4$)
with a hope that such an unified theory approaches the (multi)critical point at
the Planck scale.
