  It is noted that the internal space-time symmetries of relativistic particles
are dictated by Wigner's little groups. The symmetry of massive particles is
like the three-dimensional rotation group, while the symmetry of massless
particles is locally isomorphic to the two-dimensional Euclidean group. It is
noted also that, while the rotational degree of freedom for a massless particle
leads to its helicity, the two translational degrees of freedom correspond to
its gauge degrees of freedom. It is shown that the E(2)-like symmetry of of
massless particles can be obtained as an infinite-momentum and/or zero-mass
limit of the O(3)-like symmetry of massive particles. This mechanism is
illustrated in terms of a sphere elongating into a cylinder. In this way, the
helicity degree of freedom remains invariant under the Lorentz boost, but the
transverse rotational degrees of freedom become contracted into the gauge
degree of freedom.
