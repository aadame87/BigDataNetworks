  Maldacena and Nunez [hep-th/0008001] identified a gravity solution describing
pure N=1 Yang-Mills (YM) in the IR. Their (smooth) supergravity solution
exhibits confinement and the U(1)_R chiral symmetry breaking of the dual YM
theory, while the singular solution corresponds to the gauge theory phase with
unbroken U(1)_R chiral symmetry. In this paper we discuss supersymmetric type
IIB compactifications on resolved conifolds with torsion. We rederive singular
background of [hep-th/0008001] directly from the supersymmetry conditions. This
solution is the relevant starting point to study non-BPS backgrounds dual to
the high temperature phase of pure YM. We construct the simplest black hole
solution in this background. We argue that it has a regular Schwarzschild
horizon and provides a resolution of the IR singularity of the chirally
symmetric extremal solution as suggested in [hep-th/0011146].
