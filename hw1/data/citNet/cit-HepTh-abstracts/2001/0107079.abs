  I present a brief review on some of the recent developments in topological
quantum field theory. These include topological string theory, topological
Yang-Mills theory and Chern-Simons gauge theory. It is emphasized how the
application of different field and string theory methods has led to important
progress, opening entirely new points of view in the context of Gromov-Witten
invariants, Donaldson invariants, and quantum-group invariants for knots and
links.
