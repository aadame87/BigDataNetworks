  Twisted Eguchi-Kawai reduced chiral models are shown to be formally
equivalent to a U(1) non-commutative parent theory. The non-commutative theory
describes the vacuum dynamics of the non-commutative charged tachyonic field of
a brane system. To make contact with the continuum non-commutative theory, a
double scaling large N limit for the reduced model is required. We show a
possible limiting procedure, which we propose to investigate numerically. Our
numerical results show substantial consistency with the outlined procedure
