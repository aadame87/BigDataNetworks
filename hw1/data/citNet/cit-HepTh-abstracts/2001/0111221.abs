Title: An illustrated guide to D-branes in SU(3)
Authors: Sonia Stanciu
Comments: 33 pages (v2: minor typos corrected.)
\\
  We give a systematic account of symmetric D-branes in the Lie group SU(3). We
determine both the classical and quantum moduli space of (twisted) conjugacy
classes in terms of the (twisted) Stiefel diagram of the Lie group. We show
that the allowed (twisted) conjugacy classes are in one-to-one correspondence
with the integrable highest weight representations of the (twisted) affine Lie
algebra. In particular, we show how the charges of these D-branes fit in the
twisted K-theory groups.
