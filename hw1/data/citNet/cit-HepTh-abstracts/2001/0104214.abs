Title: An Exact Solution to a Three Dimensional Ising Model and Dimensional
  Reductions
Authors: Z. Nussinov
\\
  A high temperature expansion is employed to map some complex anisotropic
nonhermitian three and four dimensional Ising models with algebraic long range
interactions into a solvable two dimensional variant. We also address the
dimensional reductions for anisotropic two dimensional XY and other models. For
the latter and related systems it is possible to have an effective reduction in
the dimension without the need of compactifying some dimensions. Some solutions
are presented. This framework further allows for some very simple general
observations. It will be seen that the absence of a ``phase interference''
effect plays an important role in high dimensional problems. A very forbidding
purely algebraic recursive series solution to the three dimensional nearest
neighbor Ising model will be given. In the aftermath, the full-blown three
dimensional nearest neighbor Ising model is exactly mapped onto a single spin
1/2 particle with nontrivial dynamics. All this allows for a formal high
dimensional Bosonization.
