  We construct exact solitons on noncommutative tori for the type of actions
arising from open string field theory. Given any projector that describes an
extremum of the tachyon potential, we interpret the remaining gauge degrees of
freedom as a gauge theory on the projective module determined by the tachyon.
Whenever this module admits a constant curvature connection, it solves exactly
the equations of motion of the effective string field theory. We describe in
detail such a construction on the noncommutative tori. Whereas our exact
solution relies on the coupling to a gauge theory, we comment on the
construction of approximate solutions in the absence of gauge fields.
