  We study a geometry of the partition function which is defined in terms of a
solution of the five-term relation. It is shown that the 3-dimensional
hyperbolic structure or Euclidean AdS_3 naturally arises in the classical limit
of this invariant. We discuss that the oriented ideal tetrahedron can be
assigned to the partition function of string.
