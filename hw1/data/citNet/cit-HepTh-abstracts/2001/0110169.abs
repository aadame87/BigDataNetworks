  Certain aspects of three dimensional asymptotically de Sitter spaces are
studied, with emphasis on the mapping between gravity observables and the
representation of the conformal symmetry of the boundary. In particular, we
show that non-real conformal weights for the boundary theory correspond to
space-times that have non-zero angular momentum. Some miscellaneous results on
the role of the holonomies and isometry groups are also presented.
