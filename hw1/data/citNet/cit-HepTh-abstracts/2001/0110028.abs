  We study the dynamics of a large class of N=1 quiver theories, geometrically
realized by type IIB D-brane probes wrapping cycles of local Calabi-Yau
threefolds. These include N=2 (affine) A-D-E quiver theories deformed by
superpotential terms, as well as chiral N=1 quiver theories obtained in the
presence of vanishing 4-cycles inside a Calabi-Yau. We consider the various
possible geometric transitions of the 3-fold and show that they correspond to
Seiberg-like dualities (represented by Weyl reflections in the A-D-E case or
`mutations' of bundles in the case of vanishing 4-cycles) or large N dualities
involving gaugino condensates (generalized conifold transitions). Also duality
cascades are naturally realized in these classes of theories, and are related
to the affine Weyl group symmetry in the A-D-E case.
