Title: On Massive High Spin Particles in (A)dS

  In this Letter we consider the problem of partial masslessness and unitarity
in (A)dS using gauge invariant description of massive high spin particles. We
show that for S = 2 and S = 3 cases such formalism allows one correctly
reproduce all known results. Then we construct a gauge invariant formulation
for massive particles of arbitrary integer spin s in arbitrary space-time
dimension d. For d = 4 our results confirm the conjecture made recently by
Deser and Waldron.
