  Using the methods of the 'form factor program' exact expressions of all
matrix elements are obtained for several operators of the quantum sine-Gordon
model alias the massive Thirring model. A general formula is presented which
provides form factors in terms of an integral representation. In particular
charge-less operators as for example the current of the topological charge, the
energy momentum tensor and all higher currents are considered. In the breather
sector it is found the quantum sine-Gordon field equation holds with an exact
relation between the 'bare' mass and the normalized mass. Also a relation for
the trace of the energy momentum is obtained. All results are compared with
Feynman graph expansion and full agreement is found.
