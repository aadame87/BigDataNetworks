  Real-time anomalous fermion number violation is investigated for massless
chiral fermions in spherically symmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge field
backgrounds which can be weakly dissipative or even nondissipative. Restricting
consideration to spherically symmetric fermion fields, the zero-eigenvalue
equation of the time-dependent effective Dirac Hamiltonian is studied in
detail. For generic spherically symmetric SU(2) gauge fields in Minkowski
spacetime, a relation is presented between the spectral flow and two
characteristics of the background gauge field. These characteristics are the
well-known ``winding factor,'' which is defined to be the change of the
Chern-Simons number of the associated vacuum sector of the background gauge
field, and a new ``twist factor,'' which can be obtained from the
zero-eigenvalue equation of the effective Dirac Hamiltonian but is entirely
determined by the background gauge field. For a particular class of (weakly
dissipative) Luscher-Schechter gauge field solutions, the level crossings are
calculated directly and nontrivial contributions to the spectral flow from both
the winding factor and the twist factor are observed. The general result for
the spectral flow may be relevant to electroweak baryon number violation in the
early universe.
