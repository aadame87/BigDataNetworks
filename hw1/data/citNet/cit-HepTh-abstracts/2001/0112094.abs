  We investigate the W-algebras generated by the integer dimension chiral
primary operators of the SU(2)_0 WZNW model. These have a form almost identical
to that found in the c=-2 model but have, in addition, an extended Kac-Moody
structure. Moreover on Hamiltonian reduction these SU(2)_0 W-algebras exactly
reduce to those found in c=-2. We explicitly find the free field
representations for the chiral j=2 and j=3 operators which have respectively a
fermionic doublet and bosonic triplet nature. The correlation functions of
these operators accounts for the rational solutions of the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation that we find. We explicitly compute the full
algebra of the j=2 operators and find that the associativity of the algebra is
only guaranteed if certain null vectors decouple from the theory. We conjecture
that these algebras may produce a quasi-rational conformal field theory.
