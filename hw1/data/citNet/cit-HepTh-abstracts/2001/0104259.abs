  Harnessing the unimodular degree of freedom in the definition of any toric
diagram, we present a method of constructing inequivalent gauge theories which
are world-volume theories of D-branes probing the same toric singularity. These
theories are various phases in partial resolution of Abelian orbifolds. As
examples, two phases are constructed for both the zeroth Hirzebruch and the
second del Pezzo surfaces. We show that such a phenomenon is a special case of
``Toric Duality'' proposed in hep-th/0003085. Furthermore, we investigate the
general conditions that distinguish these different gauge theories with the
same (toric) moduli space.
