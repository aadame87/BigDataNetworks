  We show that the topological massive BF theories can be written as a pure BF
term through field redefinitions. The fields are rewritten as power expansion
series in the inverse of the mass parameter $m$. We also give a cohomological
justification of this expansion through BRST framework. In this approach the BF
term can be seen as a topological generator for massive BF theories.
