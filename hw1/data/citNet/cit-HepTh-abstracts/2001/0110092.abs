  Connection between the partition function for the 2D sigma model with
boundary pertubations and the low energy effective action for massless fields
from in the open string theory is discussed. In the non-abelian case with a
stack of $N$ D-branes, the terms up to the order of $\alpha'^3$ are found
\\
