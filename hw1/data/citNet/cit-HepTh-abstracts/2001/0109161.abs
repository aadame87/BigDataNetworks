  We analyse in detail the quantization of a simple noncommutative model of
spontaneous symmetry breaking in zero dimensions taking into account the
noncommutative setting seriously. The connection to the counting argument of
Feyman diagrams of the corresponding theory in four dimensions is worked out
explicitly. Special emphasis is put on the motivation as well as the
presentation of some well-known basic notions of quantum field theory which in
the zero-dimensional theory can be studied without being spoiled by technical
complications due to the absence of divergencies.
