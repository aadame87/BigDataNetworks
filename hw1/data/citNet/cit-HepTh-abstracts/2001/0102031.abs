  Relations between the global structure of the gauge group in elliptic
F-theory compactifications, fractional null string junctions, and the
Mordell-Weil lattice of rational sections are discussed. We extend results in
the literature, which pertain primarily to rational elliptic surfaces and
obtain pi^1(G) where G is the semi-simple part of the gauge group. We show how
to obtain the full global structure of the gauge group, including all U(1)
factors. Our methods are not restricted to rational elliptic surfaces. We also
consider elliptic K3's and K3-fibered Calabi-Yau three-folds.
