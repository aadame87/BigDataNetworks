Title: Gauge Couplings and Group Dimensions in the Standard Model
Authors: Ralf Alfons Engeldinger
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  The gauge field term in the Standard Model Lagrangian is slightly rewritten,
suggesting that the three gauge couplings have absorbed factors which depend on
the dimensions of the corresponding gauge groups. The ratios of the physical
couplings may turn out to be dominated by these factors, with deviations due to
quantum corrections.
