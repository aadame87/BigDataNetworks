  We introduce normal coordinates on the infinite dimensional group $G$
introduced by Connes and Kreimer in their analysis of the Hopf algebra of
rooted trees. We study the primitive elements of the algebra and show that they
are generated by a simple application of the inverse Poincar\'e lemma, given a
closed left invariant 1-form on $G$. For the special case of the ladder
primitives, we find a second description that relates them to the Hopf algebra
of functionals on power series with the usual product. Either approach shows
that the ladder primitives are given by the Schur polynomials. The relevance of
the lower central series of the dual Lie algebra in the process of
renormalization is also discussed, leading to a natural concept of
$k$-primitiveness, which is shown to be equivalent to the one already in the
literature.
