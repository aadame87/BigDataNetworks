  Dynamics of the multi-component, multi-field quintessence and gravity is
formulated as relativistic N-particle dynamics, embedded in a static viscus
flat space and under the forces given by an interacting Lorentz scalar
potential via exchange of field bosons. The Ratra-Peebles power-law potential
of effective single-field quintessence can be derived from this microscopic
perspective. In certain situations, the effective dynamics can be made
identical to that of the single complex quintessence, except for that the
overall U(1) symmetry is not manifestly broken. The present formulation
provides a convenient gauge for analyzing the superhorizon perturbations and
possibly for quantization of superhorizon fields and gravity.
