  Horava--Witten M theory -- heterotic string duality poses special problems
for the twisted sectors of heterotic orbifolds. In [1] we explained how in M
theory the twisted states couple to gauge fields apparently living on M9 branes
at both ends of the eleventh dimension at the same time. The resolution
involves 7D gauge fields which live on fixed planes of the (T^4/Z_N) x
(S^1/Z_2) x R^{5,1} orbifold and lock onto the 10D gauge fields along the
intersection planes. The physics of such intersection planes does not follow
directly from the M theory but there are stringent kinematic constraints due to
duality and local consistency, which allowed us to deduce the local fields and
the boundary conditions at each intersection. In this paper we explain various
phenomena at the intersection planes in terms of duality between HW and type I'
superstring theories. The orbifold fixed planes are dual to stacks of D6
branes, the M9 planes are dual to O8 orientifold planes accompanied by D8
branes, and the intersections are dual to brane junctions. We engineer several
junction types which lead to distinct patterns of 7D/10D gauge field locking,
7D symmetry breaking and/or local 6D fields. Another aspect of brane
engineering is putting the junctions together; sometimes, the combined effect
is rather spectacular from the HW point of view and the quantum numbers of some
twisted states have to `bounce' off both ends of the eleventh dimension before
their heterotic identity becomes clear. Some models involve D6/O8 junctions
where the string coupling diverges towards the orientifold plane. We use the
heterotic-HW-I' duality to predict what should happen at such junctions.
