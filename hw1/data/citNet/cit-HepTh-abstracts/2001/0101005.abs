  A generalization of the two-dimensional Yang-Mills and generalized Yang-Mills
theory is introduced in which the building B-F theory is nonlocal in the
auxiliary field. The classical and quantum properties of this nonlocal
generalization are investigated and it is shown that for large gauge groups,
there exist a simple correspondence between the properties a nonlocal theory
and its corresponding local theory.
