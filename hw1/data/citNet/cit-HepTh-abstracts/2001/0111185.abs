  We present a discrete total variation calculus in Hamiltonian formalism in
this paper. Using this discrete variation calculus and generating functions for
the flows of Hamiltonian systems, we derive two-step symplectic-energy
integrators of any finite order for Hamiltonian systems from a variational
perspective. The relationship between symplectic integrators derived directly
from the Hamiltonian systems and the variationally derived symplectic-energy
integrators is explored.
