  Topological properties of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters are studied on the
torus. Namely, the probability that their topology yields a given subgroup of
the first homology group of the torus is computed for Q=1, 2, 3 and 4. The
expressions generalize those obtained by Pinson for percolation (Q=1).
Numerical results are also presented for three tori of different moduli. They
agree with the theoretical predictions for Q=1, 2 and 3. For Q=4 agreement is
not ruled out but what seems logarithmic corrections makes it harder to decide.
