  Generic classes of string compactifications include ``brane throats''
emanating from the compact dimensions and separated by effective potential
barriers raised by the background gravitational fields. The interaction of
observers inside different throats occurs via tunnelling and is consequently
weak. This provides a new mechanism for generating small numbers in Nature. We
apply it to the hierarchy problem, where supersymmetry breaking near the
unification scale causes TeV sparticle masses inside the standard model throat.
We also design naturally long-lived cold dark matter which decays within a
Hubble time to the approximate conformal matter of a long throat. This may
soften structure formation at galactic scales and raises the possibility that
much of the dark matter of the universe is conformal matter. Finally, the
tunnelling rate shows that the coupling between throats, mediated by bulk
modes, is stronger than a naive application of holography suggests.
