Title: Strings on Calabi--Yau spaces and Toric Geometry
Author: Maximilian Kreuzer
Comments: error in Hodge data of complete intersections corrected, published in
  Nucl.Phys. B Conf. Suppl. 102 (2001) 87

  After a brief introduction into the use of Calabi--Yau varieties in string
dualities, and the role of toric geometry in that context, we review the
classification of toric Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and present some results on
complete intersections. While no proof of the existence of a finite bound on
the Hodge numbers is known, all new data stay inside the familiar range
$h_{11}+h_{12}\le 502$.
