  We study realization of the target space diffeomorphisms in the type $C$
topological string. We found that the charges, which generate transformations
of the boundary observables, form an algebra, which differs from that of bulk
charges by the contribution of the bubbled disks. We discuss applications to
noncommutative field theories.
