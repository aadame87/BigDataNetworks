  We perform the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization of Yang-Mills theory on a
2-point space, discussing the formulation of Connes-Lott as well as Connes'
real spectral triple approach. Despite of the model's apparent simplicity the
gauge structure reveals infinite reducibility and the gauge fixing is afflicted
with the Gribov problem.
