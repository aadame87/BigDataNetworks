  The covariant form of the non-Abelian gauge anomaly on noncommutative R2n is
computed for U(N) groups. Its origin and properties are analyzed. Its
connection with the consistent form of the gauge anomaly is established. We
show along the way that bi-fundamental $U(N)\times U(M)$ chiral matter carries
no mixed anomalies, and interpret this result as a consequence of the
half-dipole structure which characterizes the charged non-commutative degrees
of freedom.
