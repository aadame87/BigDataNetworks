  An exact solution, in which a D2-brane and an anti-D2-brane are connected by
an elliptically tubular D2-brane, is obtained without any junction condition.
The solution is shown to preserve one quarter of the supersymmetries of the
type-IIA Minkowski vacuum. We show that the configuration cannot be obtained by
"blowing-up" from some inhomogeneously D0-charged superstrings. The BPS bound
tells us that it is rather composed of D0-charged D2-brane-anti-D2-brane pair
and a strip of superstrings connecting them. We obtain the correction to the
charges of the string end points in the constant magnetic background.
