  We propose a new BRST-like quantization procedure which is applicable to
dynamical systems containing both first and second class constraints. It
requires no explicit separation into first and second class constraints and
therefore no conversion of second class constraints is needed. The basic
ingredient is instead an invariant projection operator which projects out the
maximal subset of constraints in involution. The hope is that the method will
enable a covariant quantization of models for which there is no covariant
separation into first and second class constraints. An example of this type is
given.
