  We consider models with N U(1) gauge fields A_{\mu}^n, N Kalb-Ramond fields
B_{\mu \nu}^n, an arbitrary bare action and a fixed UV cutoff \Lambda. Under
mild assumptions these can be obtained as effective low energy theories of
SU(N+1) Yang Mills theories in the maximal abelian gauge. For a large class of
bare actions they can be solved in the large N limit and exhibit confinement.
The confining phase is characterized by an approximate ``low energy'' vector
gauge symmetry under which the Kalb-Ramond fields B_{\mu\nu}^n transform. The
same symmetry allows for a duality transformation showing that magnetic
monopoles have condensed. The models allow for various mechanisms of
confinement, depending on which sources for A_{\mu}^n or B_{\mu \nu}^n are
switched on, but the area law for the Wilson loop is obtained in any case.
