  Orientifold vacua allow the simultaneous presence of supersymmetric bulks,
with one or more gravitinos, and non-supersymmetric combinations of BPS branes.
This ``brane supersymmetry breaking'' raises the issue of consistency for the
resulting gravitino couplings, and Dudas and Mourad recently provided
convincing arguments to this effect for the ten-dimensional $USp(32)$ model.
These rely on a non-linear realization of local supersymmetry {\it \`a la}
Volkov-Akulov, although no gravitino mass term is present, and the couplings
have a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of ``dressed'' bulk fields,
aside from a Wess-Zumino-like term, resulting from the supersymmetrization of
the Chern-Simons couplings. Here we show that {\it all} couplings can be given
a geometrical interpretation, albeit in the dual 6-form model, whose bulk
includes a Wess-Zumino term, so that the non-geometric ones are in fact
demanded by the geometrization of their duals. We also determine the low-energy
couplings for six-dimensional (1,0) models with brane supersymmetry breaking.
Since these include both Chern-Simons and Wess-Zumino terms, only the resulting
field equations are geometrical, aside from contributions due to vectors of
supersymmetric sectors.
