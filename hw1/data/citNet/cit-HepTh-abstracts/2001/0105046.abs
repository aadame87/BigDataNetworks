  The fusion products of admissible representations of the su(2) WZW model at
the fractional level k=-4/3 are analysed. It is found that some fusion products
define representations for which the spectrum of L_0 is not bounded from below.
Furthermore, the fusion products generate representations that are not
completely reducible and for which the action of L_0 is not diagonalisable. The
complete set of representations that is closed under fusion is identified, and
the corresponding fusion rules are derived.
