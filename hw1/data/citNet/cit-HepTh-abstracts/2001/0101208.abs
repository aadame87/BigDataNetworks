  Using the method developed by Callan and Thorlacius, we study the low energy
effective geometry on a two-dimensional string lattice by examining the
energy-momentum relations of the low energy propagation modes on the lattice.
We show that the geometry is identical for both the oscillation modes tangent
and transverse to the network plane. We determine the relation between the
geometry and the lattice variables. The lowest order effective field theory is
given by the dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional N=1 Maxwell theory.
The gauge symmetry is related to a property of a three-string junction but not
of a higher order junction. A half of the supersymmetries in the effective
field theory should be broken at high energy.
