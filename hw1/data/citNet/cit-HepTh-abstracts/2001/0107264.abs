  We discuss the compactification of type IIB supergravity on a Calabi-Yau
manifold in the presence of both RR and NS fluxes for the three-form fields. We
obtain the classical potential both by direct compactification and by using the
techniques of N=2 gauged supergravity in four-dimensions. We briefly discuss
the properties of such potential and compare the result with previous
derivations.
