  We extend the Vecchia-Veneziano-Witten (VVW) model of QCD in the chiral limit
and for large colour number $N_c$, by introducing an effective dilaton-gluon
coupling from which we derive both the axion and dilaton potentials.
Furthermore, using a string inspired model, we determine a new interquark
potential as a perturbative series in terms of the interquark distance $r$. Our
potential goes beyond Dick one obtained in [8] and shares the same features as
the Bian-Huang-Shen potential $V_{BHS}$ which depends only on odd powers of $r$
[22].
