  Finite-dimensional representations of Onsager's algebra are characterized by
the zeros of truncation polynomials. The Z_N-chiral Potts quantum chain
hamiltonians (of which the Ising chain hamiltonian is the N=2 case) are the
main known interesting representations of Onsager's algebra and the
corresponding polynomials have been found by Baxter and Albertini, McCoy and
Perk in 1987-89 considering the Yang-Baxter-integrable 2-dimensional chiral
Potts model. We study the mathematical nature of these polynomials. We find
that for N>2 and fixed charge Q these don't form classical orthogonal sets
because their pure recursion relations have at least N+1-terms. However,
several basic properties are very similar to those required for orthogonal
polynomials. The N+1-term recursions are of the simplest type: like for the
Chebyshev polynomials the coefficients are independent of the degree. We find a
remarkable partial orthogonality, for N=3,5 with respect to Jacobi-, and for
N=4,6 with respect to Chebyshev weight functions. The separation properties of
the zeros known from orthogonal polynomials are violated only by the extreme
zero at one end of the interval.
