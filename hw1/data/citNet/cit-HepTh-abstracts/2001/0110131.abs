  We develop a superspace Noether procedure for supersymmetric field theories
in 4-dimensions for which an off-shell formulation in ordinary superspace
exists. In this way we obtain an elegant and compact derivation of the various
supercurrents in these theories. We then apply this formalism to compute the
central charges for a variety of effective actions. As a by-product we also
obtain a simple derivation of the anomalous superconformal Ward-identity in N=2
Yang-Mills theory. The connection with linearized supergravity is also
discussed.
