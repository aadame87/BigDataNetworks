  A family of conformal boundary states for a free boson on a circle is
constructed. The family contains superpositions of conventional U(1)-preserving
Neumann and Dirichlet branes, but for general parameter values the boundary
states are fundamental and preserve only the conformal symmetry. The relative
overlaps satisfy Cardy's condition, and each boundary state obeys the
factorisation constraint. It is also argued that, together with the
conventional Neumann and Dirichlet branes, these boundary states already
account for all fundamental conformal D-branes of the free boson theory. The
results can be generalised to the situation with N=1 world-sheet supersymmetry,
for which the family of boundary states interpolates between superpositions of
non-BPS branes and combinations of conventional brane anti-brane pairs.
