  Dynamical generation of 4d gauge theories and gravity at low energy from the
3d ones at high energy is studied, based on the fermion condensation mechanism
recently proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen and Georgi. For gravity, 4d Einstein
gravity is generated from the multiple copy of the 3d ones, by referring to the
two form gravity. Since the 3d Einstein action without matter coupling is
topological, ultraviolet divergences are less singular in our model. In the
gauge model, matter fermions are introduced on the discrete lattice following
Wilson. Then, the 4d gauge interactions are correctly generated from the 3d
theories even in the left-right asymmetric theories of the standard model. In
order for this to occur, the Higgs fields as well as the gauge fields of the
extra dimension should be generated by the fermion condensates. Therefore, the
generation of the 4d standard model from the multiple copy of the 3d ones is
quite promising. To solve the doubling problem in the weak interaction sector,
two kinds of discrete lattices have to be introduced separately for L- and
R-handed sectors, and the two types of Higgs fields should be generated.
