  We consider a real Lagrangian off-critical submodel describing the soliton
sector of the so-called conformal affine $sl(3)^{(1)}$ Toda model coupled to
matter fields (CATM). The theory is treated as a constrained system in the
context of Faddeev-Jackiw and the symplectic schemes. We exhibit the parent
Lagrangian nature of the model from which generalizations of the sine-Gordon
(GSG) or the massive Thirring (GMT) models are derivable. The dual description
of the model is further emphasized by providing the relationships between
bilinears of GMT spinors and relevant expressions of the GSG fields. In this
way we exhibit the strong/weak coupling phases and the (generalized)
soliton/particle correspondences of the model. The $sl(n)^{(1)}$ case is also
outlined.
