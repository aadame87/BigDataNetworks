  We review the brane world sum rules of Gibbons at al for compact five
dimensional warped models with identical four-geometries and bulk dynamics
involving scalar fields with generic potential. We show that the absence of
dilaton tadpoles in the action functional of the theory is linked to one of
these sum rules. Moreover, we calculate the dilaton mass term and derive the
condition that is necessary for stabilizing the system.
