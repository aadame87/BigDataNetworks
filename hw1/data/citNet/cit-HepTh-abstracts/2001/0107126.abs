  We find and study solutions to the Einstein equations in D dimensions coupled
to a scalar field source with a Liouville potential under the assumption of D-2
planar symmetry. The general static or time-dependent solutions are found
yielding three classes of SO(D-2) symmetric spacetimes. In D=4 homogeneous and
isotropic subsets of these solutions yield planar scalar field cosmologies. In
D=5 they represent the general static or time-dependent backgrounds for a
dilatonic wall-type brane Universe of planar cosmological symmetry. Here we
apply these solutions as SO(8) symmetric backgrounds to non-supersymmetric 10
dimensional string theories, the open USp(32) type I string and the heterotic
string SO(16)XSO(16). We obtain the general SO(9) solutions as a particular
case. All static solutions are found to be singular with the singularity
sometimes hidden by a horizon. The solutions are not asymptotically flat or of
constant curvature. The singular behavior is no longer true once we permit
space and time dependence of the spacetime metric much like thick domain wall
or global vortex spacetimes. We analyze the general time and space dependent
solutions giving implicitly a class of time and space dependent solutions and
describe the breakdown of an extension to Birkhoff's theorem in the presence of
scalar matter. We argue that the solutions described constitute the general
solution to the field configuration under D-2 planar symmetry.
