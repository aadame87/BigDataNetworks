  We extent the previous determinations of nonasymptotic critical behavior of
Phys. Rev B32, 7209 (1985) and B35, 3585 (1987) to accurate expressions of the
complete classical-to-critical crossover (in the 3-d field theory) in terms of
the temperature-like scaling field (i.e., along the critical isochore) for : 1)
the correlation length, the susceptibility and the specific heat in the
homogeneous phase for the n-vector model (n=1 to 3) and 2) for the spontaneous
magnetization (coexistence curve), the susceptibility and the specific heat in
the inhomogeneous phase for the Ising model (n=1). The present calculations
include the seventh loop order of Murray and Nickel (1991) and closely account
for the up-to-date estimates of universal asymptotic critical quantities
(exponents and amplitude combinations) provided by Guida and Zinn-Justin [J.
Phys. A31, 8103 (1998)].
