  We investigate supersymmetric tubular configurations in the matrix theory. We
construct a host of BPS configurations of eight supersymmetries. They can be
regarded as cylindrical D2 branes carrying nonvanishing angular momentum. For
the simplest tube, the world volume can be described as noncommutative tube and
the world volume dynamics can be identified as a noncommutative gauge theory.
Among the BPS configurations, some describe excitations on the tube and others
describe many parallel tubes of different size and center.
