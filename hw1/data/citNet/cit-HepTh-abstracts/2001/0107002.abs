  In this short note we construct the DLCQ description of the flux seven-branes
in type IIA string theory and discuss its basic properties. The matrix model
involves dipole fields. We explain the relation of this nonlocal matrix model
to various orbifolds. We also give a spacetime interpretation of the
Seiberg-Witten-like map, proposed in a different context first by Bergman and
Ganor, that converts this matrix model to a local, highly nonlinear theory.
