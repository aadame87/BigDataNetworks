  We study axially symmetric monopoles of both the SU(2)
Yang-Mills-Higgs-Dilaton (YMHD) as well as of the SU(2)
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs-Dilaton (EYMHD) system. We find that equally to
gravity, the presence of the dilaton field can render an attractive phase. We
also study the influence of a massive dilaton on the attractive phase in the
YMHD system.
