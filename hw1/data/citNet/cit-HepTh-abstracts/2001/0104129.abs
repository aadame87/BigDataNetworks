  A geometrical interpretation of Grassmannian anticommuting coordinates is
given. They are taken to represent an indefiniteness inherent in every
spacetime point on the level of the spacetime foam. This indeterminacy is
connected with the fact that in quantum gravity in some approximation we do not
know the following information : are two points connected by a quantum wormhole
or not ? It is shown that: (a) such indefiniteness can be represented by
Grassmanian numbers, (b) a displacement of the wormhole mouth is connected with
a change of the Grassmanian numbers (coordinates). In such an interpretation of
supersymmetry the corresponding supersymmetrical fields must be described in an
invariant manner on the background of the spacetime foam.
