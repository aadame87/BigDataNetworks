  The lagrangian description of irreducible massless representations of the
Poincare group with the corresponding Young tableaux having two rows along with
some explicit examples including the notoph and Weyl tensor is given. For this
purpose is used the method of the BRST constructions adopted to the systems of
second class constraints by the construction of an auxiliary representations of
the algebras of constraints in terms of Verma modules.
