Title: World-Sheet String Duality and the Hidden Supersymmetry
Authors: Tamiaki Yoneya
Comments: 12 pages, talk presented at the 10th International Symposium on
  String Theory (July 3-7, Fukuoka, Japan, 2001) and a part of lectures given
  at the Summer Conference on Strings (July 16-27, Beijing, China, 2001)

  It is reviewed how space-time supersymmetry is realized nonlinearly in open
superstring theory without making the GSO projection. We show that the
world-sheet string dualities, viz. dualities of open-closed strings and of
open-open strings, play crucial roles for the existence of 10 dimensional N=2
supersymmetry in a spontaneously broken phase. We also speculate on a possible
mechanism of the restoration of supersymmetry from the viewpoint of world-sheet
dynamics.
