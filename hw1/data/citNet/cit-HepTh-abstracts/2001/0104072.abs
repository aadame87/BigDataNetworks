  We investigate the possibility of constructing a locally supersymmetric
extension of NGT (Nonsymmetric Gravitation Theory), based on the graded
extension of the Poincare group. In the framework of the simple model that we
propose, we end up with a no-go result, namely the impossibility of cancelling
some linear contribution in the gravitino field. This drawback seems to
seriously undermine the construction of a supergravity based on NGT.
