  We study some wrapped configurations of branes in the near-horizon geometry
of a stack of other branes. The common feature of all the cases analyzed is a
quantization rule and the appearance of a finite number of static
configurations in which the branes are partially wrapped on spheres. The energy
of these configurations can be given in closed form and the analysis of their
small oscillations shows that they are stable. The cases studied include
D(8-p)-branes in the type II supergravity background of Dp-branes (for p less
or equal than 5), M5-branes in the M5-brane geometry in M-theory and D3-branes
in a (p,q) fivebrane background in the type IIB theory. The brane
configurations found admit the interpretation of bound states of strings (or
M2-branes in M-theory) which extend along the unwrapped directions. We check
this fact directly in a particular case by using the Myers polarization
mechanism.
