  We explicitly quantize the general second-class constrained system at the
level of deformation quantization such that the quantization is covariant with
respect to local coordinates on the phase space. The approach is based on
constructing the effective first-class constraint (gauge) system equivalent to
the original second-class one and can also be understood as a far-going
generalization of the Fedosov quantization. The effective gauge system is
quantized by the BFV--BRST procedure. The star product for the Dirac bracket is
explicitly constructed as the quantum multiplication of BRST observables. We
introduce and explicitly construct a Dirac bracket counterpart of the
symplectic connection, called the Dirac connection. We identify a particular
star product associated with the Dirac connection for which the constraints are
in the center of the respective star-commutator algebra; when reduced to the
constraint surface, this star product can be recognized as a Fedosov one.
