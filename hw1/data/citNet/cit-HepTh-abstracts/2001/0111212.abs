  We study IIA/B string theory compactified on twisted circles. These models
possess closed string tachyons and reduce to type 0B/A theory in a special
limit. Using methods of gauged linear sigma models and mirror symmetry we
construct a conformal field theory which interpolates between these models and
flat space via an auxiliary Liouville direction. Interpreting motion in the
Liouville direction as renormalization group flow, we argue that the end point
of tachyon condensation in all these models (including 0B/A theory) is
supersymmetric type II theory. We also find a zero-slope limit of these models
which is best described in a T-dual picture as a type II NS-NS fluxbrane. In
this limit tachyon condensation is an interesting and well posed problem in
supergravity. We explicitly determine the tachyon as a fluctuation of
supergravity fields, and perform a rudimentary numerical analysis of the
relevant flows.
