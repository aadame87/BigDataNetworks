  Renormalization is cast in the form of a Lie algebra of matrices. By
exponentiation, these matrices generate counterterms for Feynman diagrams with
subdivergences. The matrices are triangular, and in general infinite. As
representations of an insertion operator, the matrices provide explicit
representations of the Connes-Kreimer Lie algebra. In fact, the right-symmetric
nonassociative algebra of the Connes-Kreimer insertion product is equivalent to
an ``Ihara bracket'' in the matrix Lie algebra. We check our results in a few
three-loop examples in scalar field theory. Apart from the obvious application
to high-precision phenomenology, some ideas about possible applications in
noncommutative geometry and functional integration are given.
