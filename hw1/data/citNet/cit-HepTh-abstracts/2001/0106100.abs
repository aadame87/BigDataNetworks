  In the intersecting braneworld models, higher curvature corrections to the
Einstein action are necessary to provide a non-trivial geometry (brane tension)
at the brane junctions. By introducing such terms in a Gauss-Bonnet form, we
give an effective description of localized gravity on the singular
delta-function branes. There exists a non-vanishing brane tension at the
four-dimensional brane intersection of two 4-branes. Importantly, we give
explicit expressions of the graviton propagator and show that the
Randall-Sundrum single-brane model with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk
correctly gives a massless graviton on the brane as for the RS model. We
explore some crucial features of completely localized gravity in the solitonic
braneworld solutions obtained with a choice (\xi=1) of solutions. The no-go
theorem known for Einstein's theory may not apply to the \xi=1 solution. As
complementary discussions, we provide an effective description of the power-law
corrections to Newtonian gravity on the branes or at the common intersection
thereof.
