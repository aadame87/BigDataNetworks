  We study soliton solutions in supersymmetric scalar field theory with a class
of potentials. We study both bosonic and fermionic zero-modes around the
soliton solution. We study two possible couplings of gauge fields to these
models. While the Born-Infeld like coupling has one normalizable mode (the zero
mode), the other kind of coupling has no normalizable modes. We show that
quantum mechanical problem which determines the spectrum of fluctuation modes
of the scalar, fermion and the gauge field is identical. We also show that only
the lowest lying mode, i.e., the zero mode, is normalizable and the rest of the
spectrum is continuous.
