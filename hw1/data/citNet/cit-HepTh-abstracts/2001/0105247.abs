  Quadratic tachyon profile has been discussed in the boundary string field
theory. We here compute the g-function by factorizing the cylinder amplitude.
The answer is compared with the disc partition function. The boundary state is
constructed. We extend these computations to those of the boundary sine-Gordon
model at the free fermion point.
