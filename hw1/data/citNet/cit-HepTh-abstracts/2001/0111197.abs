Title: Quantum correlations, measurement and the origin of uncertainty
Authors: Daniele Tommasini
Comments: 5 pages. This can be considered as a note or an appendix to my
  previous paper "Quantum Theory finally reconcilied with Special Relativity"
  quant-ph/0111083
\\
  I argue that the correlations that are predicted by Quantum Field Theory
should not be interpreted as a real sign of non locality.
