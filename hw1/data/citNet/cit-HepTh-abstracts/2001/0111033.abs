  The ``Laughlin'' picture of the Fractional Quantum Hall effect can be derived
using the ``exotic'' model based on the two-fold centrally-extended planar
Galilei group. When coupled to a planar magnetic field of critical strength
determined by the extension parameters, the system becomes singular, and
``Faddeev-Jackiw'' reduction yields the ``Chern-Simons'' mechanics of Dunne,
Jackiw, and Trugenberger. The reduced system moves according to the Hall law.
