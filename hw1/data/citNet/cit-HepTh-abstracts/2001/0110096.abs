  We find giant graviton configurations of an M5-brane probe in the D=11
supergravity background generated by a stack of non-threshold (M2,M5) bound
states. The M5-brane probe shares three directions with the background and
wraps a two-sphere transverse to the bound states. For a particular value of
the worldvolume gauge field of the PST formalism, there exist solutions of the
equations of motion for which the M5-brane probe behaves as a wave propagating
in the (M2,M5) background. We have checked that the probe breaks the
supersymmetry of the background exactly as a massless particle moving along the
trajectory of its center of mass.
