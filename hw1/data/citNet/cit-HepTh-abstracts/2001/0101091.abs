  We include the brane curvature scalar to study its cosmological implication
in the brane world cosmology. This term is usually introduced to obtain the
well-defined stress-energy tensor on the boundary of anti de
Sitter-Schwarzschild space. Here we treat this as the perturbed term for
cosmological purpose. We find corrections to the well-known equation of the
brane cosmology. It contains new interesting terms which may play the important
role in the brane cosmology.
