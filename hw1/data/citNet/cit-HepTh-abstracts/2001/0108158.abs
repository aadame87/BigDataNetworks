  We calculate conformal anomalies in noncommutative gauge theories by using
the path integral method (Fujikawa's method). Along with the axial anomalies
and chiral gauge anomalies, conformal anomalies take the form of the
straightforward Moyal deformation in the corresponding conformal anomalies in
ordinary gauge theories. However, the Moyal star product leads to the
difference in the coefficient of the conformal anomalies between noncommutative
gauge theories and ordinary gauge theories. The $\beta$ (Callan-Symanzik)
functions which are evaluated from the coefficient of the conformal anomalies
coincide with the result of perturbative analysis.
