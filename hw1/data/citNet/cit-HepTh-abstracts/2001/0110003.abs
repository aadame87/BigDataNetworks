  We consider a conformal unified theory as the basis of conformal-invariant
cosmological model where the permanent rigid state of the universe is
compatible with the primordial element abundance and supernova data. We show
that the cosmological creation of vector Z and W bosons, in this case, is
sufficient to explain the CMB temperature (2.7 K). The primordial bosons
violate the baryon number in the standard model as a result of anomalous
nonconservation of left-handed currents and a nonzero squeezed vacuum
expectation value of the topological Chern-Simons functional.
