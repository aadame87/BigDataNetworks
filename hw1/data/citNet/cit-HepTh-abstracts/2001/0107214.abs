  We study linearized perturbations of eleven-dimensional $OSp(32|1)$
Chern-Simons supergravity. The action contains a term that changes the value of
the cosmological constant, as considered by Horava. It is shown that the
spectrum contains a 3-form and a 6-form whose field strengths are dual to each
other, thus providing a link with the eleven-dimensional supergravity of
Cremmer, Julia and Scherk. The linearized equations for the graviton and
Rarita-Schwinger field are shown to be the standard ones as well.
