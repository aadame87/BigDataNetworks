  QCD(1+1) in the limit of a large number of flavours N_F and a large number of
colours N_C is examined in the small N_F/N_C regime. Using perturbation theory
in N_F/N_C, stringent results for the leading behaviour of the spectrum
departing from N_F/N_C = 0 are obtained. These results provide benchmarks in
the light of which previous truncated treatments of QCD(1+1) at large N_F and
N_C are critically reconsidered.
