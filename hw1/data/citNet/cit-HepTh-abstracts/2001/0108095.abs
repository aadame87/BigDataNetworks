  Dynamics of D-branes on $SU(2)/U(1)$ gauged WZW model are investigated. We
find the effective action for infinite $k$, where $k$ is the level of WZW
model. We also consider finite $k$ correction to the effective action which is
compatible with Fedosov's deformation quantization of the background.
