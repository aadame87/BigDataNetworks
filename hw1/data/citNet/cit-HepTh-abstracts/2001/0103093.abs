  We review many quantum aspects of torsion theory and discuss the possibility
of the space-time torsion to exist and to be detected. The paper starts, in
Chapter 2, with an introduction to the classical gravity with torsion, that
includes also interaction of torsion with matter fields. In Chapter 3, the
renormalization of quantum theory of matter fields and related topics, like
renormalization group, effective potential and anomalies, are considered.
Chapter 4 is devoted to the action of particles in a space-time with torsion,
and to possible physical effects generated by the background torsion. In
particular, we review the upper bounds for the background torsion which are
known from the literature. In Chapter 5, the comprehensive study of the
possibility of a theory for the propagating completely antisymmetric torsion
field is presented. We show, that the propagating torsion may be consistent
with the principles of quantum theory only in the case when the torsion mass is
much greater than the mass of the heaviest fermion coupled to torsion. Then,
universality of the fermion-torsion interaction implies that torsion itself has
a huge mass, and can not be observed in realistic experiments. In Chapter 6, we
briefly discuss the string-induced torsion and the possibility to induce
torsion action and torsion itself through the quantum effects of matter fields.
