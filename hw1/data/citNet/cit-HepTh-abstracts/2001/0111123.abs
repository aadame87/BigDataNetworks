  We show that the general Lorentz- and CPT-violating extension of quantum
electrodynamics is one-loop renormalizable. The one-loop Lorentz-violating beta
functions are obtained, and the running of the coefficients for Lorentz and CPT
violation is determined. Some implications for theory and experiment are
discussed.
