  To help focus ideas regarding possible routes to the breakdown of Lorentz
invariance, it is extremely useful to explore concrete physical models that
exhibit similar phenomena. In particular, acoustics in Bose--Einstein
condensates has the interesting property that at low-momentum the phonon
dispersion relation can be written in a ``relativistic'' form exhibiting an
approximate ``Lorentz invariance''. Indeed all of low-momentum phonon physics
in this system can be reformulated in terms of relativistic curved-space
quantum field theory. In contrast, high-momentum phonon physics probes regions
where the dispersion relation departs from the relativistic form and thus
violates Lorentz invariance. This model provides a road-map of at least one
route to broken Lorentz invariance. Since the underlying theory is manifestly
physical this type of breaking automatically avoids unphysical features such as
causality violations. This model hints at the type of dispersion relation that
might be expected at ultra-high energies, close to the Planck scale, where
quantum gravity effects are suspected to possibly break ordinary Lorentz
invariance.
