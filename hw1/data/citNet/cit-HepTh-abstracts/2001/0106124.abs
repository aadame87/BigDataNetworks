  We study two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models in which the target spaces
are the coset supermanifolds U(n+m|n)/[U(1)\times U(n+m-1|n)] \cong
CP^{n+m-1|n} (projective superspaces) and OSp(2n+m|2n)/OSp(2n+m-1|2n) \cong
S^{2n+m-1|2n} (superspheres), n, m integers, -2\leq m\leq 2; these quantum
field theories live in Hilbert spaces with indefinite inner products. These
theories possess non-trivial conformally-invariant renormalization-group fixed
points, or in some cases, lines of fixed points. Some of the conformal
fixed-point theories can also be obtained within Landau-Ginzburg theories. We
obtain the complete spectra (with multiplicities) of exact conformal weights of
states (or corresponding local operators) in the isolated fixed-point conformal
field theories, and at one special point on each of the lines of fixed points.
Although the conformal weights are rational, the conformal field theories are
not, and (with one exception) do not contain the affine versions of their
superalgebras in their chiral algebras. The method involves lattice models that
represent the strong-coupling region, which can be mapped to loop models, and
then to a Coulomb gas with modified boundary conditions. The results apply to
percolation, dilute and dense polymers, and other statistical mechanics models,
and also to the spin quantum Hall transition in noninteracting fermions with
quenched disorder.
