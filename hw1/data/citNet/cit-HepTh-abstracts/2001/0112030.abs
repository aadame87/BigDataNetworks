  The induced fractional fermion number at zero temperature is topological (in
the sense that it is only sensitive to global asymptotic properties of the
background field), and is a sharp observable (in the sense that it has
vanishing rms fluctuations). In contrast, at finite temperature, it is shown to
be generically nontopological, and not a sharp observable.
