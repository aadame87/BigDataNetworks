  We discuss the issue of the cosmological constant in non-commutative
non-supersymmetric gauge theories. In particular, in orbifold field theories
non-commutativity acts as a UV cut-off. We suggest that in these theories
quantum corrections give rise to a vacuum energy \rho, that is controlled by
the non-commutativity parameter \theta, \rho ~ 1/theta^2 (only a soft
logarithmic dependence on the Planck scale survives). We demonstrate our claim
in a two-loop computation in field theory and by certain higher loop examples.
Based on general expressions from string theory, we suggest that the vacuum
energy is controlled by non-commutativity to all orders in perturbation theory.
