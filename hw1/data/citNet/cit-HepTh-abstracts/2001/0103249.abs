  We confront Cardy's suggested c-function for four-dimensional field theories
with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetries in asymptotically free
vectorlike gauge theories with fermions transforming according to different
representations under the gauge group. Assuming that the infrared limit of the
c-function is determined by the dimension of the associated Goldstone manifold,
we find that this c-function always decreases between the ultraviolet and
infrared fixed points.
