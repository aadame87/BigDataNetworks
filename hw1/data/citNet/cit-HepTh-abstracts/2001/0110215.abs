  In noncommutative field theories, it was known that one-loop effective action
describes propagation of non-interacting open Wilson lines, obeying the flying
dipole's relation. We show that two-loop effective action describes cubic
interaction among `closed string' states created by open Wilson lines. Taking
d-dimensional noncommutative [\Phi^3] theory as the simplest setup, we compute
nonplanar contribution at low-energy and large noncommutativity limit. We find
that the contribution is expressible in a remarkably simple cubic interaction
involving scalar open Wilson lines only and nothing else. We show that the
interaction is purely geometrical and noncommutative in nature, depending only
on sizes of each open Wilson line.
