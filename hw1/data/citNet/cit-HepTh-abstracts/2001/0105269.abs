  Brane-world singularities are analysed, emphasizing the case of supergravity
in singular spaces where the singularity puzzle is naturally resolved. These
naked singularities are either time-like or null, corresponding to the finite
or infinite amount of conformal time that massless particles take in order to
reach them. Quantum mechanically we show that the brane-world naked
singularities are inconsistent. Indeed we find that time-like singularities are
not wave-regular, so the time-evolution of wave packets is not uniquely defined
in their vicinity, while null singularities absorb incoming radiation. Finally
we stress that for supergravity in singular spaces there is a topological
obstruction, whereby naked singularities are necessarily screened off by the
second boundary brane.
