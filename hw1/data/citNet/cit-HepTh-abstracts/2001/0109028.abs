  We explicitly construct a Hamiltonian whose exact eigenfunctions are the
generalized Laguerre functions. Moreover, we present the related raising and
lowering operators. We investigate the corresponding coherent states by
adopting the Gazeau-Klauder approach, where resolution of unity and overlapping
properties are examined. Coherent states are found to be similar to those found
for a particle trapped in a P\"oschl-Teller potential of the trigonometric
type. Some comparisons with Barut-Girardello and Klauder-Perelomov methods are
noticed.
