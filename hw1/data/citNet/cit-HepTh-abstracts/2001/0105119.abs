  Canonical differential calculus is defined for finitely generated abelian
group with an involution existing consistently. Two such canonical calculi are
found out. Fermionic representation for canonical calculus is defined based on
quantized calculus. Fermionic representations for above-mentioned two canonical
calculi are searched.
