Title: A fresh look at the Bohr-Rosenfeld analysis and a proof of a conjecture
  of Heisenberg
Authors: H. Gopalkrishna Gadiyar
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  Bohr and Rosenfeld carried out an analysis of the consequences of field
theory commutation relations. In this note the analysis is sharpened. A
conjecture of Heisenberg that volume is quantized is shown to be a consequence
of the second quantization of gauge fields. A way to generalize the equations
of physics to include the Planck length is indicated.
