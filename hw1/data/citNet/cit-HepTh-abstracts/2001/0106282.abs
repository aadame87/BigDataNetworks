  We study brane matter in the ekpyrotic scenario and observe that in order to
obtain standard gravity on the visible brane, the tension of the visible brane
should be positive. If the sizes of both the fifth dimension and the Calabi-Yau
threefold are fixed, the Israel junction conditions do not allow time-dependent
brane matter. Relaxing this constraint, it is possible to obtain approximately
standard cosmology on the visible brane, with small corrections due to possible
time-dependence of the Calabi-Yau threefold.
