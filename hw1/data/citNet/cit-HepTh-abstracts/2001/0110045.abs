  supersymmetric theory

\\
  A solution to Slavnov-Taylor identities in a general four dimensional N=1
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory containing arbitrary matter superfields is
proposed. The solution proposed appears just a simple generalization of an
analogous solution in the pure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
