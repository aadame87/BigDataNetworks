Title: Moving D$_2$-brane in the Noncommutative Spacetime

  In this paper we study the noncommutativity of a moving membrane with
background fields. The open string variables are analyzed. Some scaling limits
are studied. The unitarity of the corresponding field theory is discussed. The
conditions for equivalence of noncommutativity of the $T$-dual theory in the
rest frame and noncommutativity of the original theory in the moving frame are
obtained.
