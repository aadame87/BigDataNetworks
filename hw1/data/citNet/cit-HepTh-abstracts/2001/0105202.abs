  Supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking without messenger fields is proposed. We assume
that our world is on a wall and SUSY is broken only by the coexistence of
another wall with some distance from our wall. The Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermion
is localized on the distant wall. Its overlap with the wave functions of
physical fields on our wall gives the mass splitting of physical fields on our
wall thanks to a low-energy theorem. We propose that this overlap provides a
practical method to evaluate mass splitting in models with SUSY breaking due to
the coexistence of walls.
