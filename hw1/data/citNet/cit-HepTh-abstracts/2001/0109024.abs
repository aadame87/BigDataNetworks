  We consider brane cosmology studying the shortest null path on the brane for
photons, and in the bulk for gravitons. We derive the differential equation for
the shortest path in the bulk for a 1+4 cosmological metric. The time cost and
the redshifts for photons and gravitons after traveling their respective path
are compared. We consider some numerical solutions of the shortest path
equation, and show that there is no shortest path in the bulk for the
Randall-Sundrum vacuum brane solution, the linear cosmological solution of
Bin\'etruy, et al for $\omega = -1, -{2/3}$, and for some expanding brane
universes.
