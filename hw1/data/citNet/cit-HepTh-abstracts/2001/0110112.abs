  We examine the renormalizability problem of spontaneously broken non-Abelian
gauge theory on noncommutative spacetime. We show by an explicit analysis of
the U(2) case that ultraviolet divergences can be removed at one loop level
with the same limited number of renormalization constants as required on
commutative spacetime. We thus push forward the efforts towards constructing
realistic models of gauge interactions on noncommutative spacetime.
