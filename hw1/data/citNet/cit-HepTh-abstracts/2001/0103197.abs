  We study the $c=-2$ model of logarithmic conformal field theory in the
presence of a boundary using symplectic fermions. We find boundary states with
consistent modular properties. A peculiar feature of this model is that the
vacuum representation corresponding to the identity operator is a
sub-representation of a ``reducible but indecomposable'' larger representation.
This leads to unusual properties, such as the failure of the Verlinde formula.
Despite such complexities in the structure of modules, our results suggest that
logarithmic conformal field theories admit bona fide boundary states.
