  In this lecture notes we explain and discuss some ideas concerning
noncommutative geometry in general, as well as noncommutative field theories
and string field theories. We consider noncommutative quantum field theories
emphasizing an issue of their renormalizability and the UV/IR mixing. Sen's
conjectures on open string tachyon condensation and their application to the
D-brane physics have led to wide investigations of the covariant string field
theory proposed by Witten about 15 years ago. We review main ingredients of
cubic (super)string field theories using various formulations: functional,
operator, conformal and the half string formalisms. The main technical tools
that are used to study conjectured D-brane decay into closed string vacuum
through the tachyon condensation are presented. We describe also methods which
are used to study the cubic open string field theory around the tachyon vacuum:
construction of the sliver state, ``comma'' and matrix representations of
vertices.
