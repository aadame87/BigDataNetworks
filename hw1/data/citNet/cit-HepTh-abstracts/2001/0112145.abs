  In the first part of this article, we find fractional D3-branes supergravity
solutions on orientifolded C^2/Z_2 orbifolds of type IIB string theory. The
one-loop corrected gauge couplings for the symplectic or orthogonal groups
living on the D-branes are reproduced on the world-volume of probes. In the
second part of the paper, we construct a D3-brane solution on the two-centers
Taub-NUT manifold which interpolates between fractional D3-branes in the ALE
space limit and a T-dual smeared type IIA configuration. Then, we lift this
configuration to M-theory and comment on the connections with wrapped M5-branes
solutions.
