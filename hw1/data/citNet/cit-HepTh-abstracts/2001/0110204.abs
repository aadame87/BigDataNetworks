  We show that the D25 sliver wavefunction, just as the D-instanton sliver,
factorizes when expressed in terms of half-string coordinates. We also
calculate analytically the star-product of two zero-momentum eigenstates of
$\hat{x}$ using the vertex in the oscillator basis, thereby showing that the
star-product in the matter sector can indeed be seen as multiplication of
matrices acting on the space of functionals of half strings. We then use the
above results to establish that the matrices $\rho_{1,2}$, conjectured by
Rastelli, Sen and Zwiebach to be left and right projectors on the sliver, are
indeed so.
