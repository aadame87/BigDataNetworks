  We consider the addition of charged matter (``fundametals'') to
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory and noncommutative QED, derive Feynman rules
and tree-level potentials for them, and study the divergence structure of the
theory. These particles behave very much as they do in the commutative theory,
except that (1) they occupy bound-state wavefunctions which are essentially
those of charged particles in magnetic fields, and (2) there is slight momentum
nonconservation at vertices. There is no reduction in the degree of divergence
of charged fermion loops like that which affects nonplanar noncommutative
Yang-Mills diagrams.
