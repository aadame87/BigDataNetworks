  We investigate the equation where the commutation relation in 2-dimensional
zero-curvature equation composed of the algebra-valued potentials is replaced
by the Moyal bracket and the algebra-valued potentials are replaced by the
non-algebra-valued ones with two more new variables. We call the 4-dimensional
equation the noncommutative zero-curvature equation. We show that various
soliton equations are derived by the dimensional reduction of the equation.
