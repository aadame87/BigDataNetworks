  It has been proposed that Randall-Sundrum models can be holographically
described by a regularized (broken) conformal field theory. We analyze the
foundations of this duality using a regularized version of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. We compare two- and three-point correlation functions and find
the same behaviour in both descriptions. In particular, we show that the
regularization of the deformed CFT generates kinetic terms for the sources,
which hence can be naturally treated as dynamical fields. We also discuss the
counterterms required for two- and three-point correlators in the renormalized
AdS/CFT correspondence.
