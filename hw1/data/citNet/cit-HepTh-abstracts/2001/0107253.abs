  The consequences of certain simple assumptions like smoothness of ground
state properties and vanishing of the vacuum energy (at least perturbatively)
are explored. It would be interesting from the point of view of building
realistic theories to obtain these properties without supersymmetry. Here we
show, however, at least in some quantum mechanical models, that these simple
assumptions lead to supersymmetric theories.
