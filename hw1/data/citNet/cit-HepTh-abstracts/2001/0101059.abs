  We consider the complex scalar field coupled to background NC U(1) YM and
calculate the correlator of two gauge invariant composite operators. We show
how the noncommutative gauge invariance is restored for higher correlators
(though the Green's function itself is not invariant). It is interesting that
the recently discovered noncommutative solitons appear in the calculation.
