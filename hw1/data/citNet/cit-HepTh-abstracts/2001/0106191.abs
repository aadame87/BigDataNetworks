  In frames of dS/CFT correspondence suggested by Strominger we calculate
holographic conformal anomaly for dual euclidean CFT. The holographic
renormalization group method is used for this purpose. It is explicitly
demonstrated that two-dimensional and four-dimensional conformal anomalies (or
corresponding central charges) have the same form as those obtained in AdS/CFT
duality.
