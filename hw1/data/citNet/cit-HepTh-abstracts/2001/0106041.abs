  A generalization of the Bardeen formalism to the case of warped geometries is
presented. The system determining the gauge-invariant fluctuations of the
metric induced by the scalar fluctuations of the brane is reduced to a set of
Schr\"odinger-like equations for the Bardeen potentials and for the canonical
normal modes of the scalar-tensor action. Scalar, vector and tensor modes of
the geometry are classified according to four-dimensional Lorentz
transformations. While the tensor modes of the geometry live on the brane
determining the corrections to Newton law, the scalar and and vector
fluctuations exhibit non normalizable zero modes and are, consequently, not
localized on the brane. The spectrum of the massive modes of the fluctuations
is analyzed using supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
