  We study the transmission of supersymmetry breaking via gravitational
interactions in a five-dimensional brane-world compactified on $S^1/Z_2$. We
assume that chiral matter and gauge fields are confined at the orbifold fixed
points, where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by effective brane
superpotentials. Using an off-shell supergravity multiplet we integrate out the
auxiliary fields and examine the couplings between the bulk supergravity fields
and boundary matter fields. The corresponding tree-level shift in the bulk
gravitino mass spectrum induces one-loop radiative masses for the boundary
fields. We calculate the boundary gaugino and scalar masses for arbitrary
values of the brane superpotentials, and show that the mass spectrum reduces to
the Scherk-Schwarz limit for arbitrarily large values of the brane
superpotentials.
