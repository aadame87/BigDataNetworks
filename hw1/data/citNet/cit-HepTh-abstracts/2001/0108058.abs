  It is shown that the dimensional reduction of the N_T=2, D=3 Blau-Thompson
model to D=2, i.e., the novel topological twist of N=8, D=2 super Yang-Mills
theory, provides an example of a Hodge-type cohomological theory. In that
theory the generators of the topological shift, co-shift and gauge symmetry,
together with a discrete duality operation, are completely analogous to the de
Rham cohomology operators and the Hodge *-operation.
