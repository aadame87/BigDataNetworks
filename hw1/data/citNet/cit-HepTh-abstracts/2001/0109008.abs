  Inozemtsev models are classically integrable multi-particle dynamical systems
related to Calogero-Moser models. Because of the additional q^6 (rational
models) or sin^2(2q) (trigonometric models) potentials, their quantum versions
are not exactly solvable in contrast with Calogero-Moser models. We show that
quantum Inozemtsev models can be deformed to be a widest class of partly
solvable (or quasi-exactly solvable) multi-particle dynamical systems. They
posses N-fold supersymmetry which is equivalent to quasi-exact solvability. A
new method for identifying and solving quasi-exactly solvable systems, the
method of pre-superpotential, is presented.
