  We classify supersymmetric D0-Dp bound states with a non-zero B-field by
considering T-dualities of intersecting branes at angles. Especially, we find
that the D0-D8 system with the B-field preserves 1/16, 1/8 and 3/16 of
supercharges if the B-field satisfies the ``(anti-)self-dual'' condition in
dimension eight. The D0-branes in this system are described by eight
dimensional instantons on non-commutative R^8. We also discuss the extended
ADHM construction of the eight-dimensional instantons and its deformation by
the B-field. The modified ADHM equations admit a sort of the `fuzzy sphere'
(embeddings of SU(2)) solution.
