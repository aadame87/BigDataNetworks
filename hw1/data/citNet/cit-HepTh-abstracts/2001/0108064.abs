  We study the framing dependence of the Wilson loop observable of U(N)
Chern-Simons gauge theory at large N. Using proposed geometrical large N dual,
this leads to a direct computation of certain topological string amplitudes in
a closed form. This yields new formulae for intersection numbers of cohomology
classes on moduli of Riemann surfaces with punctures (including all the
amplitudes of pure topological gravity in two dimensions). The reinterpretation
of these computations in terms of BPS degeneracies of domain walls leads to
novel integrality predictions for these amplitudes. Moreover we find evidence
that large N dualities are more naturally formulated in the context of U(N)
gauge theories rather than SU(N).
