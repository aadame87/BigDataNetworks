  We show how topological open string theory amplitudes can be computed by
using relative stable morphisms in the algebraic category. We achieve our goal
by explicitly working through an example which has been previously considered
by Ooguri and Vafa from the point of view of physics. By using the method of
virtual localization, we successfully reproduce their results for multiple
covers of a holomorphic disc, whose boundary lies in a Lagrangian submanifold
of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold, by Riemann surfaces with arbitrary genera and number of
boundary components. In particular we show that in the case we consider there
are no open string instantons with more than one boundary component ending on
the Lagrangian submanifold.
