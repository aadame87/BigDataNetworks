  The so-called ``brick-wall model'' is a semi-classical approach that has been
used to explain black hole entropy in terms of thermal matter fields. Here, we
apply the brick-wall formalism to thermal bulk fields in a Randall-Sundrum
brane world scenario. In this case, the black hole entity is really a
string-like object in the anti-de Sitter bulk, while appearing as a
Schwarzchild black hole to observers living on the brane. In spite of these
exotic circumstances, we establish that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy law is
preserved. Although a similar calculation was recently considered in the
literature, this prior work invoked a simplifying assumption (which we avoid)
that can not be adequately justified.
