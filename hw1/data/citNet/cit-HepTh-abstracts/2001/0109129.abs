  Some thermodynamical properties of Lovelock gravity are discussed in several
space-time dimensions, the holographic principle being one of the ingredients
of the discussion. As it turns out, the area law and the brickwall method,
though correct for the Einstein-Hilbert theory, may fail to work in general.
