  We point out that when a D-brane is placed in an NS-NS B field background
with non-vanishing field strength (H=dB) along the D-brane worldvolume, the
coordinate of one end of the open string does not commute with that of the
other in the low energy limit. The degrees of the freedom associated with both
ends are not decoupled and accordingly, the effective action must be quite
different from that of the ordinary noncommutative gauge theory for a constant
B background. We construct an associative and noncommutative product which
operates on the coordinates of both ends of the string and propose a new type
of noncommutative gauge action for the low energy effective theory of a
Dp-brane. This effective theory is bi-local and lives in twice as large
dimensions (2D=2(p+1)) as in the H=0 case. When viewed as a theory in the
D-dimensional space, this theory is non-local and we must force the two ends of
the string to coincide. We will then propose a prescription for reducing this
bi-local effective action to that in D dimensions and obtaining a local
effective action.
