  We argue that there are two distinct classes of type I compactification to
four dimensions on any space. These two classes are distinguished in a
mysterious way by the presence (or absence) of a discrete 6-form potential. In
simple examples, duality suggests that the new class of compactifications have
reduced numbers of moduli. We also point out analogous discrete choices in M, F
and type II compactifications, including some with $G_2$ holonomy. These
choices often result in spaces with frozen singularities.
