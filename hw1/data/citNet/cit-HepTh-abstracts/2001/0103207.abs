  We consider a brane world residing in the interior region inside the horizon
of extreme black branes. In this picture, the size of the horizon can be
interpreted as the compactification size. The large mass hierarchy is simply
translated into the large horizon size, which is provided by the magnitude of
charges carried by the black branes. Hence, the macroscopic compactification
size is a quantity calculable from the microscopic theory which has only one
physical scale, and its stabilization is guaranteed from the charge
conservation.
