  Using a Hamiltonian approach, we construct the classical and quantum theory
of open WZW strings on a strip. (These are the strings which end on WZW
branes.) The development involves non-abelian generalized Dirichlet images in
an essential way. At the classical level, we find a new non-commutative
geometry in which the equal-time coordinate brackets are non-zero at the
world-sheet boundary, and the result is an intrinsically non-abelian effect
which vanishes in the abelian limit. Using the classical theory as a guide to
the quantum theory, we also find the operator algebra and the analogue of the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the the conformal field theory of open WZW
strings.
