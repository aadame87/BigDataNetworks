  We consider the collision in 2+1 dimensions of a black hole and a negative
tension brane on an orbifold. Because there is no gravitational radiation in
2+1 dimensions, the horizon area shrinks when part of the brane falls through.
This provides a potential violation of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics. However, tracing the details of the dynamical evolution one
finds that it does not proceed from equilibrium configuration to equilibrium
configuration. Instead, a catastrophic space-time singularity develops similar
to the `big crunch' of $\Omega >1$ FRW space-times. In the context of classical
general relativity, our result demonstrates a new instability of constructions
with negative tension branes.
