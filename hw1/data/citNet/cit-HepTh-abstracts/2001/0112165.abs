  We study the dynamical equations for extra-dimensional dependence of a warp
factor and a bulk scalar in 5d brane world scenarios with induced brane metric
of constant curvature. These equations are similar to those for the time
dependence of the scale factor and a scalar field in 4d cosmology, but with the
sign of the scalar field potential reversed. Based on this analogy, we
introduce novel methods for studying the warped geometry. We construct the full
phase portraits of the warp factor/scalar system for several examples of the
bulk potential. This allows us to view the global properties of the warped
geometry. For flat branes, the phase portrait is two dimensional. Moving along
typical phase trajectories, the warp factor is initially increasing and finally
decreasing. All trajectories have timelike gradient-dominated singularities at
one or both of their ends, which are reachable in a finite distance and must be
screened by the branes. For curved branes, the phase portrait is three
dimensional. However, as the warp factor increases the phase trajectories tend
towards the two dimensional surface corresponding to flat branes. We discuss
this property as a mechanism that may stretch the curved brane to be almost
flat, with a small cosmological constant. Finally, we describe the embedding of
branes in the 5d bulk using the phase space geometric methods developed here.
In this language the boundary conditions at the branes can be described as a 1d
curve in the phase space. We discuss the naturalness of tuning the brane
potential to stabilize the brane world system.
