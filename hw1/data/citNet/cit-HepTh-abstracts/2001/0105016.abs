  A massive version of T-duality in six dimensions is given, that maps the K3
compactification of Romans' theory onto the K3 compactification of Type IIB
theory. This is done by performing a (standard) Kaluza-Klein reduction on
six-dimensional massive Type IIA and a Scherk-Schwarz reduction on Type IIB,
mapping both theories onto the same five-dimensional theory. We also comment
shortly on the difficulties arising if one intends to construct a massive
generalisation of the six-dimensional string-string duality.
