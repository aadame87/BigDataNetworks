  Spontaneously broken gauge theories are described as a perturbation of
selfdual gauge theory. Instead of the incorporation of scalar degrees of
freedom, the massive component of the gauge field is obtained from an
anti-selfdual field strength consisting of three components before gauge
fixing. The interactions describe a massive gauge theory that is non-polynomial
with an expansion containing an infinite number of terms. The Lagrangian
generalizes the form of the axial anomaly in two dimensions. Unitary
propagation of the tensor field occurs upon gauge fixing an additional
symmetry.
