Title: AdS2 Models in an Embedding Superspace
Authors: D.G.C. McKeon (University of Western Ontario), T.N. Sherry (National
  University of Ireland, Galway)
\\
  An embedding superspace, whose Bosonic part is the flat 2 + 1 dimensional
embedding space for AdS2, is introduced. Superfields and several supersymmetric
models are examined in the embedded AdS2 superspace.
