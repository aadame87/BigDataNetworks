  The negative symmetry flows are incorporated into the Riemann-Hilbert problem
for the homogeneous $A_m$-hierarchy and its $\hat{gl} (m+1, C)$ extension. A
loop group automorphism of order two is used to define a sub-hierarchy of
$\hat{gl} (m+1, C)$ hierarchy containing only the odd symmetry flows. The
positive and negative flows of the $\pm 1$ grade coincide with equations of the
multidimensional Toda model and of topological-anti-topological fusion.
