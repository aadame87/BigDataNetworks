  We discuss some properties of higher derivative (HD) bulk gravity without
Riemann tensor square term. Such a kind of gravity admits Schwarzschild Anti de
Sitter (SAdS) black hole as exact solution. It is shown that induced brane
geometry on such background is Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) radiation
dominated Universe. We show that HD terms contributions appear in the Hawking
temperature, entropy and Hubble parameter via the redefinition of 5-dimensional
gravitational constant and AdS scale parameter. These HD terms do not destroy
the AdS-dual description of radiation represented by strongly-coupled CFT.
So-called Cardy-Verlinde formula which expresses cosmological entropy as square
root from other parameters and entropies is also derived in R^2-gravity. This
talk is based on works with Shin'ichi Nojiri and Sergei D. Odintsov.
