  A spontaneously broken SU(2)xU(1) gauge theory with just one "primordial"
generation of fermions is formulated in the context of generally covariant
theory which contains two measures of integration in the action: the standard
\sqrt{-g}d^{4}x and a new \Phi d^{4}x, where \Phi is a density built out of
degrees of freedom independent of the metric. Such type of models are known to
produce a satisfactory answer to the cosmological constant problem. Global
scale invariance is implemented. After SSB of scale invariance and gauge
symmetry it is found that with the conditions appropriate to laboratory
particle physics experiments, to each primordial fermion field corresponds
three physical fermionic states. Two of them correspond to particles with
constant masses and they are identified with the first two generations of the
electro-weak theory. The third fermionic states at the classical level get
non-polynomial interactions which indicate the existence of fermionic
condensate and fermionic mass generation.
