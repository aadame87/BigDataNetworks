  We construct a classical solution of vacuum string field theory (VSFT) and
study whether it represents the perturbative open string vacuum. Our solution
is given as a squeezed state in the Siegel gauge, and it fixes the arbitrary
coefficients in the BRST operator in VSFT. We identify the tachyon and massless
vector states as fluctuation modes around the classical solution. The tachyon
mass squared \alpha m_t^2 is given in a closed form using the Neumann
coefficients defining the three-string vertex, and it reproduces numerically
the expected value of -1 to high precision. The ratio of the potential height
of the solution to the D25-brane tension is also given in terms of the Neumann
coefficients. However, the behavior of the potential height in level truncation
does not match our expectation, though there are subtle points in the analysis.
