  In this paper we propose a unified approach to (topological) string theory on
certain singular spaces in their large volume limit. The approach exploits the
non-commutative structure of D-branes, so the space is described by an
algebraic geometry of non-commutative rings. The paper is devoted to the study
of examples of these algebras. In our study there is an auxiliary commutative
algebraic geometry of the center of the (local) algebras which plays an
important role as the target space geometry where closed strings propagate. The
singularities that are resolved will be the singularities of this auxiliary
geometry. The singularities are resolved by the non-commutative algebra if the
local non-commutative rings are regular. This definition guarantees that
D-branes have a well defined K-theory class. Homological functors also play an
important role. They describe the intersection theory of D-branes and lead to a
formal definition of local quivers at singularities, which can be computed
explicitly for many types of singularities. These results can be interpreted in
terms of the derived category of coherent sheaves over the non-commutative
rings, giving a non-commutative version of recent work by M. Douglas. We also
describe global features like the Betti numbers of compact singular Calabi-Yau
threefolds via global holomorphic sections of cyclic homology classes.
