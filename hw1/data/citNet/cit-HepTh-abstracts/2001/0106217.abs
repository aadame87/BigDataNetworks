  A recently proposed connection between closed string field and an open Wilson
line defined on an arbitrary contour is further explored here. We suggest that
reparametrization invariance of a Wilson line is the principle which determines
the coupling of non-commutative gauge theory/matrix model to the modes of the
closed string. An analogue of the level matching condition on the gauge
theory/matrix model operators emerges quite naturally from the cyclic symmetry
of the straight Wilson line. We show that the generating functional of
correlation functions of these operators has the space-time gauge symmetry that
one expects to find in closed string field theory. We also identify an infinite
number of conserved operators in gauge theory/matrix model, the first of which
is known to be the conserved stress tensor.
