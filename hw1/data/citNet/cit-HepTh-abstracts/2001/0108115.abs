  In AdS5, the coupling for bulk gauge bosons runs logarithmically, not as a
power law. For this reason, one can preserve perturbative unification of
couplings. Depending on the cutoff, this can occur at a high scale. We discuss
subtleties in the calculation and present a regularization scheme motivated by
the holographic correspondence. We find that generically, as in the standard
model, the couplings almost unify. For specific choices of the cutoff and
number of scalar multiplets, there is good agreement between the measured
couplings and the assumption of high scale unification.
