  We construct new classes of exact solutions of the 4D vacuum Einstein
equations which describe ellipsoidal black holes, black tori and combined black
hole -- black tori configurations. The solutions can be static or with
anisotropic polarizations and running constants. They are defined by
off--diagonal metric ansatz which may be diagonalized with respect to
anholonomic moving frames. We examine physical properties of such anholonomic
gravitational configurations and discuss why the anholonomy may remove the
restriction that horizons must be with spherical topology.
