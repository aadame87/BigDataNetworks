  The creation of 4d de Sitter (inflationary) boundary gluing two d5 de Sitter
bulks on the classical as well as on quantum level (with account of brane QFT
via corresponding trace anomaly induced effective action) is discussed. Quantum
effects decrease the classical de Sitter brane radius or create new de Sitter
brane with even smaller radius. It is important that brane CFT may be chosen to
be dual to one of 5d de Sitter bulks, making the explicit relation of de Sitter
brane-world with dS/CFT correspondence. In this way, the localization of
gravity on the brane is shown. Moving (time-dependent) de Sitter brane in d5
SdS BH is considered. In the special coordinate system where brane equations
look like quantum-corrected FRW equations the comparison with similar brane
equations in SAdS BH bulk is done.
