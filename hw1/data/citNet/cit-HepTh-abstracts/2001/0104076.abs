  We consider a pair of noncommutative lumps in the noncommutative
Yang--Mills/M(atrix) model. In the case when the lumps are separated by a
finite distance their ``polarisations'' do not belong to orthogonal subspaces
of the Hilbert space. In this case the interaction between lumps is nontrivial.
We analyse the dynamics arisen due to this interaction in both naive approach
of rigid lumps and exactly as described by the underlying gauge model. It
appears that the exact description is given in terms of finite matrix
models/multidimensional mechanics whose dimensionality depends on the initial
conditions.
