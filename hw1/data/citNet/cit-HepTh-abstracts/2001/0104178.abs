  We construct the manifestly Lorentz-invariant twistorial formulation of N=1
D=4 superparticle with tensorial central charges which describes massive and
massless cases in a uniform manner. The tensorial central charges are realized
in terms of even spinor variables and central charge coordinates. The full
analysis of the number of conserved supersymmetries has been carried out. In
the massive case the superparticle preserves 1/4 or 1/2 of target-space
supersymmetries whereas the massless superparticle preserves two or three
supersymmetries.
