Title: BPS D3-branes on smooth ALE manifolds
Authors: Pietro Fre'
Comments: Talk given at the Conference "New Trends in Particle Physics",
  September 2001, Yalta, Ukraina
\\
  In this talk I review the recent construction of a new family of classical
BPS solutions of type IIB supergravity describing 3-branes transverse to a
6-dimensional space with topology $\mathbb{R}^{2}\times$ALE. They are
characterized by a non-trivial flux of the supergravity 2-forms through the
homology 2-cycles of a generic smooth ALE manifold. These solutions have two
Killing spinors and thus preserve $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. They are
expressed in terms of a quasi harmonic function $H$ (the ``warp factor''),
whose properties was studied in detail in the case of the simplest ALE, namely
the Eguchi-Hanson manifold. The equation for $H$ was identified as an instance
of the confluent Heun equation.
