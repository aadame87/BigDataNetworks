  We consider the classical equations of the Born-Infeld-Abelian-Higgs model
(with and without coupling to gravity) in an axially symmetric ansatz. A
numerical analysis of the equations reveals that the (gravitating)
Nielsen-Olesen vortices are smoothly deformed by the Born-Infeld interaction,
characterized by a coupling constant $\beta^2$, and that these solutions cease
to exist at a critical value of $\beta^2$. When the critical value is
approached, the length of the magnetic field on the symmetry axis becomes
infinite.
