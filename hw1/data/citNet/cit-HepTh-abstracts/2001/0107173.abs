  A holographic correspondence between data on horizon and space-time physics
is investigated. We find similarities with the AdS/CFT correspondence, based on
the observation that the optical metric near the horizon describes a Euclidean
asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. This picture emerges for a wide class of
static space-times with a non-degenerate horizon, including Schwarzschild black
holes as well as de Sitter space-time. We reveal a asymptotic conformal
symmetry at the horizon. We compute the conformal weights and 2-point functions
for a scalar perturbation and discuss possible connections with a (non-unitary)
conformal field theory located on the horizon. We then reconstruct the scalar
field and the metric from the data given on the horizon. We show that the
solution for the metric in the bulk is completely determined in terms of a
specified metric on the horizon. From the General Relativity point of view our
solutions present a new class of space-time metrics with non-spherical
horizons. The horizon entropy associated with these solutions is also
discussed.
