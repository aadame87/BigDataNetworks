  We propose an alternative inflationary universe scenario in the context of
Randall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology. In this new scenario the existence of
extra-dimension(s) plays an essential role. First, the brane universe is
initially in the inflationary phase driven by the effective cosmological
constant induced by small mismatch between the vacuum energy in the
5-dimensional bulk and the brane tension. This mismatch arises since the bulk
is initially in a false vacuum. Then, the false vacuum decay occurs, nucleating
a true vacuum bubble with negative energy inside the bulk. The nucleated bubble
expands in the bulk and consequently hits the brane, bringing a hot big-bang
brane universe of the Randall-Sundrum type. Here, the termination of the
inflationary phase is due to the change of the bulk vacuum energy. The bubble
kinetic energy heats up the universe. As a simple realization, we propose a
model, in which we assume an interaction between the brane and the bubble. We
derive the constraints on the model parameters taking into account the
following requirements: solving the flatness problem, no force which prohibits
the bubble from colliding with the brane, sufficiently high reheating
temperature for the standard nucleosynthesis to work, and the recovery of
Newton's law up to 1mm. We find that a fine tuning is needed in order to
satisfy the first and the second requirements simultaneously, although, the
other constraints are satisfied in a wide range of the model parameters.
