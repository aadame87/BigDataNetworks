  We consider a brane universe in a Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter background
spacetime of arbitrary dimensionality. It is shown that the brane evolution is
described by generalized Friedmann equations for radiative matter along with a
stiff-matter contribution. On the basis of the (conjectured) dS/CFT
correspondence, we identify various thermodynamic properties of the brane. It
is then demonstrated that, when the brane crosses the de Sitter cosmological
horizon, the CFT thermodynamics and Friedmann-like equations coincide.
Moreover, the CFT entropy is shown to be expressible in a generalized
Cardy-Verlinde form. Finally, we consider the holographic entropy bounds in
this scenario.
