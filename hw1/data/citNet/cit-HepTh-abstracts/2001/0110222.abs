  Stability of massive antisymmetric tensor fields with the Chern-Simons type
action in anti de Sitter spacetime is studied. It is found that there exists a
complete set of solutions whose energy is conserved and positive definite if
the mass is positive. Scalar products of the solutions are shown to be
well-defined and conserved. In contrast to the previously studied scalar field
case there is no other set of stable solutions with a different kind of
boundary condition.
