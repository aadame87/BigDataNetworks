  The possibility to study the M/string theory cosmology via 5d bulk & brane
action is investigated. The role of the 4-form field in the theory of BPS
branes in 5d is clarified. We describe arguments suggesting that the effective
4d description of the universe in the ekpyrotic scenario (hep-th/0103239)
should lead to contraction rather than expansion of the universe. To verify
these arguments, we study the full 5d action prior to its integration over the
5th dimension. We show that if one adds the potential V(Y) to the action of the
bulk brane, then the metric ansatz used in the ekpyrotic scenario does not
solve the dilaton and gravitational equations. To find a consistent
cosmological solution one must use a more general metric ansatz and a complete
5d description of the brane interaction instead of simply adding an effective
4d bulk brane potential V(Y).
