  Using algebraic methods the Neveu-Schwarz fermionic matter sliver is
constructed. Inspirited by the wedge algebra two equations for the sliver,
linear and quadratic, are considered. It is shown that both equations give the
same nontrivial answer. The sliver is considered also using CFT methods where
it is defined as the limit of the wedge states in the NS sector of the
superstring.
