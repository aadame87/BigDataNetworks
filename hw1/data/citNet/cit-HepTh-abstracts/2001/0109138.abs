  We introduce three non-local observables for the two-dimensional Ising model.
At criticality, conformal field theory may be used to obtain theoretical
predictions for their behavior. These formulae are explicit enough to show that
their asymptotics are described by highest weights $h_{pq}$ from the Kac table
for c=1/2 distinct from those of the three unitary representations (0, 1/16 and
1/2).
