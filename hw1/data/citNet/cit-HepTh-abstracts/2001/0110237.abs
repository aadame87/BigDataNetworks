  Real-time anomalous fermion number violation has been investigated for
massless chiral fermions in spherically symmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills gauge field
backgrounds which can be weakly dissipative or even nondissipative. Restricting
consideration to spherically symmetric fermion fields, a relation has been
found between the spectral flow of the Dirac Hamiltonian and two
characteristics of the background gauge field. This new result may be relevant
to electroweak baryon number violation in the early universe.
