Title: Gauge Invariance and Gauge-Factor Group in Causal Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: N. Emmenegger
Comments: 70 pages, PhD Thesis

  In the present work the gauge invariance of causal Yang-Mills theory will be
proven with the aid of the gauge-factor group. For that purpose it must be
shown, that the operator valued distributions T_n and D_n(ret) occurring in the
causal S-matrix construction can be written, after applying the gauge variation
d_Q, as a divergence. Since merely local terms lead to gauge destroying
expressions, one has to focus on them exclusively. In the first part of the
work the local gauge-factor group will be defined in the style of the concept
of gauge cohomology theory. It will be shown, that every element out of the so
defined factor group under the transformation d_Q leads to a divergence of the
entire operator valued distribution d_Q(T_n). In the second part all local
terms arising in causal Yang-Mills theory are systematically investigated.
Without further restrictions there can be proven, that every local operator
valued distribution is an element of the gauge factor group or equal to zero.
This concludes the demonstration of gauge invariance of causal Yang-Mills
theory.
