  We present some preliminary investigations about the AdS2*S2 D3-branes in
AdS3*S3. We analyse the quadratic fluctuations of Dirac-Born-Infeld action
around a given semi-classical D-brane configuration and compare them with
results obtained by using conformal field theory techniques. We finally study
classical motions of open strings attached to those D-branes and analyse the
role of the spectral flow in this context.
