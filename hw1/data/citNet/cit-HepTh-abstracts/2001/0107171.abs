  1.An expression for the smoothed counting function in terms of the fractional
derivatives of the delta-function is presented. 2. The Neumann-Dirichlet (ND)
boundary problem is introduced via some elementary examples based on a
functorial relation between the ND, DD, NN and periodic boundary conditions.
