  We investigate the most general non(anti)commutative geometry in N=1 four
dimensional superspace. We find that a nontrivial non(anti)commutative
superspace geometry compatible with supertranslations exists with
non(anti)commutation parameters which may depend on the spinorial coordinates.
The algebra is in general nonassociative. Imposing associativity introduces
additional constraints which however allow for nontrivial commutation relations
involving fermionic coordinates. We define an associative *-product by
extending to superspace the Kontsevich procedure. In a string theory contest we
discuss the connection between non(anti)commutative grassmannian geometry in
superspace and string propagation in curved backgrounds. Finally, N=2 euclidean
superspace is also discussed.
