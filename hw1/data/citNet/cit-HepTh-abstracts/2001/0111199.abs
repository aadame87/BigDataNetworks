  We consider a D-brane probe in unstable string background associated with
flux branes. The twist in spacetime metric reponsible for the supersymmetry
breaking is shown to manifest itself in mixing of open Wilson lines with the
phases of some adjoint matter fields, resulting in a nonlocal and
nonsupersymmetric form of Yang-Mills theory as the probe dynamics. This
provides a setup where one can study fate of a large class of unstable closed
string theories that include as a limit type 0 theories and various orbifolds
of type II and type 0 theories. We discuss the limit of ${\bf C}/Z_n$ orbifold
in some detail and speculate on couplings with closed string tachyons.
