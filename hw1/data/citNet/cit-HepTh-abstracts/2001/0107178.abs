  Using branes in massive Type IIA string theory, and a novel decoupling limit,
we provide an explicit correspondence between non-commutative Chern-Simons
theory and the fractional quantum Hall fluid. The role of the electrons is
played by D-particles, the background magnetic field corresponds to a RR 2-form
flux, and the two-dimensional fluid is described by non-commutative D2-branes.
The filling fraction is given by the ratio of the number of D2-branes and the
number of D8-branes, and therefore by the ratio rank/level of the Chern-Simons
gauge theory. Quasiparticles and quasiholes are realized as endpoints of
fundamental strings on the D2-branes, and are found to possess fractional
D-particle charges and fractional statistics.
