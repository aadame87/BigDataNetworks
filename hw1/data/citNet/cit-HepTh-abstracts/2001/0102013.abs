  We study the relationship between three non-Abelian topologically massive
gauge theories, viz. the naive non-Abelian generalization of the Abelian model,
Freedman-Townsend model and the dynamical 2-form theory, in the canonical
framework. Hamiltonian formulation of the naive non-Abelian theory is presented
first. The other two non-Abelian models are obtained by deforming the
constraints of this model. We study the role of the auxiliary vector field in
the dynamical 2-form theory in the canonical framework and show that the
dynamical 2-form theory cannot be considered as the embedded version of naive
non-Abelian model. The reducibility aspect and gauge algebra of the latter
models are also discussed.
