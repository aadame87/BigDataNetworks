  We discuss origin of equivalence between noncommutative and ordinary
Yang-Mills from point of view of string theory. Working in BRST/Hamiltonian
framework first we investigate string model in the decoupling limit and show
that change of variables and applying the conversion of constraints of
decoupled string theory gives commuting coordinates on the D-brane. Also, we
discuss algebra of constraints in general case and show the ways of having
commutative coordinates without going to decoupling limit. It could be argued
that noncommutative string in B-field is equivalent to the commutative model.
We investigate the case of the membrane ending on the M-5-brane in constant
C-field and discuss noncommutative/commutative equivalence in this case.
