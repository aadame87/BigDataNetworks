  We obtain the couplings of noncommutative branes of type II string theories
to constant Ramond-Ramond backgrounds, for BPS as well as non-BPS branes, in
the background-independent description. For the BPS branes, we also generalize
these couplings to other descriptions, and thereby argue their equivalence to
the known couplings in the commutative description. The first part is a review
of earlier work while the second part contains some additional observations.
