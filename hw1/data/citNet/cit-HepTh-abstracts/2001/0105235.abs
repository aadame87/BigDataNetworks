  The metric of the gravity dual of a field theory should contain precisely the
same information as the field theory. We discuss this connection in the N=4
theory where a scalar vev may be introducedat the level of 5d supergravity and
the solutions lifted to 10d. We stress the role of brane probing in finding the
coordinates appropriate to the field theory. In these coordinates the metric
parametrizes the gauge invariant operators of the field theory and either side
of the duality is uniquely determined by the other. We follow this same chain
of computations for the 10d lift of the N=2* geometry of Pilch and Warner. The
brane probe of the metric reveals the 2d moduli space and the functional form
of the gauge coupling. In the coordinates appropriate to the field theory the
metric on moduli space takes a very simple form and one can read off the
gravity predictions for operators in the field theory. Surprisingly there is
logarithmic renormalization even in the far UV where the field theory reverts
to N=4 super Yang-Mills. We extend the analysis of Buchel et al to find the D3
brane source distribution that generates the supergravity prediction for the
gauge coupling for the whole class of solutions corresponding to different
points on moduli space. This distribution does not account for the logarithmic
behaviour in the rest of the metric though. We discuss possible resolutions of
the discrepancy.
