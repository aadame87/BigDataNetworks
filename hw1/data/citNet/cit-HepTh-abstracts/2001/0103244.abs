  We consider the T-duality relations between Type 0A and 0B theories, and show
that this constraints the possible couplings of the tachyon to the RR-fields.
Due to the `doubling' of the RR sector in Type 0 theories, we are able to
introduce a democratic formulation for the Type 0 effective actions, in which
there is no Chern-Simons term in the effective action. Finally we discuss how
to embed Type II solutions into Type 0 theories.
