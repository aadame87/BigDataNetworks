  We study Little String Theories (LST) with ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetry
arising, in a suitable double scaling limit, from 5-branes in heterotic string
theory or in the heterotic-like type II/$(-)^{F_L}\times {\rm shift}$. The
limit in question, previously studied in the type II case, is such that the
resulting holographically dual pairs, i.e. bulk string theory and LST are at a
finite effective coupling. In particular, the internal $(2,2)$ SCFT on the
string theory side is non-singular and given by $SL(2)/U(1)\times SU(2)/U(1)$
coset. In the type II orbifold case, we determine the orbifold action on the
internal SCFT and construct the boundary states describing the non-BPS massive
states of a completely broken $SO$ gauge theory, in agreement with the dual
picture of D5-branes in type II/$\Omega\times {\rm shift}$. We also describe a
different orbifold action which gives rise to a $Sp$ gauge theory with $(1,1)$
supersymmetry. In both the heterotic SO(32) and $E_8\times E_8$ cases, we
determine the gauge bundles which correspond to the above SCFT and break down
the gauge groups to $SU(2)\times SO(28)$ and $E_7\times E_8$ respectively. The
double scaling limit in this case involves taking small instanton together with
small string coupling constant limit. We determine the spectrum of chiral gauge
invariant operators with the corresponding global symmetry charges on the LST
side and compare with the massless excitations on the string theory side,
finding agreement for multiplicities and global charges.
