  We analyze different types of quantum corrections to the Cardy-Verlinde
entropy formula in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe and in an (anti)-de
Sitter space. In all cases we show that quantum corrections can be represented
by an effective cosmological constant which is then used to redefine the
parameters entering the Cardy-Verlinde formula so that it becomes valid also
with quantum corrections, a fact that we interpret as a further indication of
its universality. A proposed relation between Cardy-Verlinde formula and the
ADM Hamiltonian constraint is given.
