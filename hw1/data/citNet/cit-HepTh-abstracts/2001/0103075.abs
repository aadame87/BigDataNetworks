  We discuss the phase structure of the four-dimensional compact U(1) gauge
theory at finite temperature using a deformation of the topological model. Its
phase structure can be determined by the behavior of the Coulomb gas (CG)
system on the cylinder. We utilize the relation between the CG system and the
sine-Gordon (SG) model, and investigate the phase structure of the gauge theory
in terms of the SG model. Especially, the critical-line equation of the gauge
theory in the strong-coupling and high-temperature region is obtained by
calculating the one-loop effective potential of the SG model.
