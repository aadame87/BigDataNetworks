  We show that the entropy of any black object in any dimension can be
understood as the entropy of a highly excited string on the stretched horizon.
The string has a gravitationally renormalized tension due to the large redshift
near the horizon. The Hawking temperature is given by the Hagedorn temperature
of the string. As examples, we consider black holes with one (black p-branes)
or two charges, Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and the BTZ black hole in
addition to Schwarzschild black holes. We show that the vanishing and
nonvanishing extremal entropies can be obtained as smooth limits of the
near-extreme cases.
