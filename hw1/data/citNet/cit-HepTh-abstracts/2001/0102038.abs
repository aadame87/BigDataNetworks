  We show that the Higgs branch of a four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, with
gauge and matter content summarised by an E_8 quiver diagram, is identical to
the generalised Coulomb branch of a four-dimensional superconformal strongly
coupled gauge theory with E_8 global symmetry. This is the final step in
showing that there is a Higgs-Coulomb identity of this kind for each of the
cases {0}, A_1, A_2, D_4, E_6, E_7 and E_8. This series of equivalences
suggests the existence of a mirror symmetry between the quiver theories and the
strongly coupled theories. We also discuss how to interpret the parameters of
the quiver gauge theory in terms of the Hanany-Witten picture.
