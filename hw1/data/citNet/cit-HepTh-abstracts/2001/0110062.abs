  The dS/CFT correspondence differs from its AdS/CFT counterpart in some ways,
yet is strikingly similar to it in many others. For example, both involve CFTs
defined on connected spaces (despite the fact that the conformal boundary of
deSitter space is not connected), and both impose constraints on scalar masses
(Strominger's bound for deSitter, and the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for
Anti-deSitter). We argue that these similarities can be explored and exploited
using a slight extension of the Euclidean approach to AdS/CFT. The methods are
particularly compatible with Hull's embedding of deSitter Space in a timelike
T-dual version of M-theory.
