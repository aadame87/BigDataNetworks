  In contrast to what happens for ferromagnets, the lattice structure
participates in a crucial way to determine existence and type of critical
behaviour in antiferromagnetic systems. It is an interesting question to
investigate how the memory of the lattice survives in the field theory
describing a scaling antiferromagnet. We discuss this issue for the square
lattice three-state Potts model, whose scaling limit as T->0 is argued to be
described exactly by the sine-Gordon field theory at a specific value of the
coupling. The solution of the scaling ferromagnetic case is recalled for
comparison. The field theory describing the crossover from antiferromagnetic to
ferromagnetic behaviour is also introduced.
