  This is an introductory review of gravity on branes with an emphasis on
codimension 1 models. However, for a new result it is also pointed out that the
cosmological evolution of the 3-brane in the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and
Porrati may follow the standard Friedmann equation.
 Contents:
  1. Introduction
  2. Conventions
  3. The Lanczos-Israel matching conditions
  4. The action principle with codimension 1 hypersurfaces: Need for the
Gibbons-Hawking term
  5. The Newtonian limit on thin branes
  6. A remark on black holes in the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati
  7. The cosmology of codimension 1 brane worlds
