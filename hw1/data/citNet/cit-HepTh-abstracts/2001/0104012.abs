  We study a (1+1)-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ model with a light-cone zero
mode and constant external source to describe spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
the broken phase, we find degenerate vacua and discuss their stability based on
effective-potential analysis. The vacuum triviality is spurious in the broken
phase because these states have lower energy than Fock vacuum. Our results are
based on the variational principle.
