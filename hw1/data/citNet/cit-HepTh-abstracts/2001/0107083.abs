Title: Spectral geometry for strings and branes
Authors: Dmitri V. Vassilevich
Comments: A talk at "Quantum Gravity and Spectral Geometry", Naples, July 2001,
  to appear in the Proceedings
Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 104 (2002) 208-211
\\
  I give a short guide into applications of the heat kernel technique to
string/brane physics with an emphasis on the emerging boundary value problems.
