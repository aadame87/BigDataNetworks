  Homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies of the Planck era before the classical
Einstein equations become valid are studied taking quantum gravitational
effects into account. The cosmological evolution equations are renormalization
group improved by including the scale dependence of Newton's constant and of
the cosmological constant as it is given by the flow equation of the effective
average action for gravity. It is argued that the Planck regime can be treated
reliably in this framework because gravity is found to become asymptotically
free at short distances. The epoch immediately after the initial singularity of
the Universe is described by an attractor solution of the improved equations
which is a direct manifestation of an ultraviolet attractive renormalization
group fixed point. It is shown that quantum gravity effects in the very early
Universe might provide a resolution to the horizon and flatness problem of
standard cosmology, and could generate a scale-free spectrum of primordial
density fluctuations.
