  We study essentially non-Abelian backgrounds in the five dimensional N=4
gauged SU(2)$\times$U(1) supergravity. Static configurations that are invariant
under either the SO(4) spatial rotations or with respect to the SO(3) rotations
and translations along the fourth spatial coordinate are considered. By
analyzing consistency conditions for the equations for supersymmetric Killing
spinors we derive the Bogomol'nyi equations and obtain their globally regular
solutions. The SO(4) symmetric configurations contain the purely magnetic
non-Abelian fields together with the purely electric Abelian field and possess
two unbroken supersymmetries. The SO(3) configurations have only the
non-Abelian fields and preserve four supersymmetries.
