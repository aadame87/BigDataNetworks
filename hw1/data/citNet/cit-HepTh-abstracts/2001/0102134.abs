  The algebra of the generators of translations in superspace is unstable, in
the sense that infinitesimal perturbations of its structure constants lead to
non-isomorphic algebras. We show how superspace extensions remedy this
situation (after arguing that remedy is indeed needed) and review the benefits
reaped in the description of branes of all kinds in the presence of the extra
dimensions.
