  We study a scale invariant two measures theory where a dilaton field \phi has
no explicit potentials. The scale transformations include a shift
\phi\to\phi+const. The theory demonstrates a new mechanism for gene- ration of
the exponential potential: in the conformal Einstein frame (CEF), after SSB of
scale invariance, the theory develops the exponential potential and, in
general, non-linear kinetic term is generated as well. The possibility of
quintessence solutions are shown. As an example, for one choice of the
parameters we obtain standard scaling solutions usually used in the context of
the quintessential scenario. For other choice of the parameters, the theory
allows a scaling solution with equation of state p_{\phi}=w\rho_{\phi} where w
is restricted by -1<w<-0.82. The regime where the fermionic matter dominates
(as compared to the dilatonic contribution) is analyzed. There it is found that
starting from a single fermionic field we obtain exactly three different types
of spin 1/2 particles in CEF that appears to suggest a new approach to the
family problem of particle physics. It is automatically achieved that for two
of them, fermion masses are constants, gravitational equations are canonical
and the "fifth force" is absent. For the third type of particles, a fermionic
self-interaction appears as a result of SSB of scale invariance.
