  We study a Randall-Sundrum model modified by a Gauss-Bonnet interaction term.
We consider, in particular, a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric on the brane
and analyse the resulting cosmological scenario. It is shown that the usual
Friedmann equations are recovered on the brane. The equation of state relating
the enery density and the pressure is uniquely determined by the matching
conditions. A cosmological solution with negative pressure is found.
