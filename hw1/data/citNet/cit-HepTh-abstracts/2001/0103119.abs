  We discuss the possible relevance of some recent mathematical results and
techniques on four-manifolds to physics. We first suggest that the existence of
uncountably many R^4's with non-equivalent smooth structures, a mathematical
phenomenon unique to four dimensions, may be responsible for the observed
four-dimensionality of spacetime. We then point out the remarkable fact that
self-dual gauge fields and Weyl spinors can live on a manifold of Euclidean
signature without affecting the metric. As a specific example, we consider
solutions of the Seiberg-Witten Monopole Equations in which the U(1) fields are
covariantly constant, the monopole Weyl spinor has only a single constant
component, and the 4-manifold M_4 is a product of two Riemann surfaces
Sigma_{p_1} and Sigma_{p_2}. There are p_{1}-1(p_{2}-1) magnetic(electric)
vortices on \Sigma_{p_1}(\Sigma_{p_2}), with p_1 + p_2 \geq 2 (p_1=p_2= 1 being
excluded). When the two genuses are equal, the electromagnetic fields are
self-dual and one obtains the Einstein space \Sigma_p x \Sigma_p, the monopole
condensate serving as the cosmological constant.
