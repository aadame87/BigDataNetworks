  In phenomenological models with extra dimensions there is a natural symmetry
group associated to a brane universe, -- the group of rotations of normal
bundle of the brane. We consider Kaluza-Klein gauge fields corresponding to
this group and show that they can be localized on the brane in models with
warped extra dimensions. These gauge fields are coupled to matter fields which
have nonzero rotation moment around the brane. In a particular example of a
four-dimensional brane embedded into six-dimensional asymptotically
anti-deSitter space, we calculate effective four-dimensional coupling constant
between the localized fermion zero modes and the Kaluza-Klein gauge field.
