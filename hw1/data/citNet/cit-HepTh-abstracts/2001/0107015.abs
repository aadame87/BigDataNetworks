  By representing the field content as well as the particle creation operators
in terms of fermionic Fock operators, we compute the corresponding matrix
elements of the Federbush model. Only when these matrix elements satisfy the
form factor consistency equations involving anyonic factors of local
commutativity, the corresponding operators are local. We carry out the
ultraviolet limit, analyze the momentum space cluster properties and
demonstrate how the Federbush model can be obtained from the
$SU(3)_3$-homogeneous sine-Gordon model. We propose a new Lagrangian which on
one hand constitutes a generalization of the Federbush model in a Lie algebraic
fashion and on the other a certain limit of the homogeneous sine-Gordon models.
