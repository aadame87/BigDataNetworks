  We construct D=11 supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theories
arising when M-theory fivebranes wrap supersymmetric cycles. The cases
considered are M-fivebranes wrapped on (i) a complex Lagrangian four-cycle in a
D=8 hyper-Kaehler manifold corresponding to a D=2 field theory with (2,1)
supersymmetry (ii) a product of two holomorphic two-cycles in a product of two
Calabi-Yau two-folds corresponding to a D=2 field theory with (2,2)
supersymmetry and (iii) a product of a holomorphic two-cycle and a SLAG
three-cycle in a product of a Calabi-Yau two-fold and a Calabi-Yau three-fold
corresponding to a quantum mechanics with two supercharges. In each case we
construct BPS equations and find IR superconformal fixed points corresponding
to new examples of AdS/CFT duality arising from the twisted field theories.
