  The $n$-instanton contribution to the Seiberg-Witten prepotential of ${\bf
N}=2$ supersymmetric $d=4$ Yang Mills theory is represented as the integral of
the exponential of an equivariantly exact form. Integrating out an overall
scale and a U(1) angle the integral is rewritten as $(4n-3)$ fold product of a
closed two form. This two form is, formally, a representative of the Euler
class of the Instanton moduli space viewed as a principal U(1) bundle, because
its pullback under bundel projection is the exterior derivative of an angular
one-form. We comment on a recent speculation of Matone concerning an analogy
linking the instanton problem and classical Liouville theory of punctured
Riemann spheres.
