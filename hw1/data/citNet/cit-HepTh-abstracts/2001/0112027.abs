  The Seiberg-Witten map links noncommutative gauge theories to ordinary gauge
theories, and allows to express the noncommutative variables in terms of the
commutative ones. Its explicit form can be found order by order in the
noncommutative parameter theta and the gauge potential A by the requirement
that gauge orbits are mapped on gauge orbits. This of course leaves
ambiguities, corresponding to gauge transformations, and there is an infinity
of solutions. Is there one better, clearer than the others ? In the abelian
case, we were able to find a solution, linked by a gauge transformation to
already known formulas, which has the property of admitting a recursive
formulation, uncovering some pattern in the map. In the special case of a pure
gauge, both abelian and non-abelian, these expressions can be summed up, and
the transformation is expressed using the parametrisation in terms of the gauge
group.
