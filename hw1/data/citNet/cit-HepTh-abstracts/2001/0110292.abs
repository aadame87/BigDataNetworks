  I study various properties of the critical limits of correlators containing
insertions of conserved and anomalous currents. In particular, I show that the
improvement term of the stress tensor can be fixed unambiguously, studying the
RG interpolation between the UV and IR limits. The removal of the improvement
ambiguity is encoded in a variational principle, which makes use of sum rules
for the trace anomalies a and a'. Compatible results follow from the analysis
of the RG equations. I perform a number of self-consistency checks and discuss
the issues in a large set of theories.
