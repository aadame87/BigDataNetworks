Title: Noncommutativity and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect
Authors: J. Gamboa, M. Loewe and J.C. Rojas
Comments: Original title changed, several parts rewritten and a section about a
  possible experimental detection of spatial noncommutativity is added
\\
  The possibility of detecting noncommutive space relics is analyzed by using
the Aharonov-Bohm effect. If space is non-commutative, it turns out that the
holonomy receives kinematical corrections that tend to diffuse the fringe
pattern. This fringe pattern has a non-trivial energy dependence and,
therefore, one could observe noncommutative effects by modifying the energy of
the incident electrons beam in the Tonomura experimental arrangement
