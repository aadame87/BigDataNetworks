  We study the matter part of the algebra of open string fields using the
3-string vertex over the sliver state, which we call ``comma vertex''. By
generalizing this comma vertex to the $N$-string overlap, we obtain a closed
form of the Neumann coefficients in the $N$-string vertex and discuss its
relation to the oscillator representation of wedge states.
