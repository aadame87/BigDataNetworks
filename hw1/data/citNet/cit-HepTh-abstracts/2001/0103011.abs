  We study the BPS domain walls of supersymmetric Yang-Mills for arbitrary
gauge group. We describe the degeneracies of domain walls interpolating between
arbitrary pairs of vacua. A recently proposed large N duality sheds light on
various aspects of such domain walls. In particular, for the case of G = SU(N)
the domain walls correspond to wrapped D-branes giving rise to a 2+1
dimensional U(k) gauge theory on the domain wall with a Chern-Simons term of
level N. This leads to a counting of BPS degeneracies of domain walls in
agreement with expected results.
