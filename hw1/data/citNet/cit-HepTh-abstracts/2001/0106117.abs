  We construct D=10 supergravity solutions corresponding to type IIB fivebranes
wrapping a two-sphere in a Calabi-Yau two-fold. These are related in the IR to
the large N limit of pure N=2 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory. We show that the
singularities in the IR correspond to the wrapped branes being distributed on a
ring. We analyse the dynamics of a probe fivebrane and show that it
incorporates the full perturbative structure of the gauge theory. For a class
of solutions the two-dimensional moduli space is non-singular and we match the
result for the corresponding slice of the Coulomb branch of the gauge theory.
