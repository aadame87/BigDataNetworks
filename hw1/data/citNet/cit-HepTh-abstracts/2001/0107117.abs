  The correlation function of the two dimensional Ising model with the nearest
neighbours interaction on the finite size lattice with the periodical boundary
conditions is derived. The expressions similar to the form factor expansion are
obtained both for the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic regions of coupling
parameter. The peculiarities caused by finite size are analyzed. The scaling
limit of the lattice form factor expansion is evaluated.
