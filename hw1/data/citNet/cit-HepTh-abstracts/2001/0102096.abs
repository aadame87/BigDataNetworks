  We construct a regularization independent procedure for implementing
perturbative renormalization. An algebraic identity at the level of the
internal lines of the diagrams is used which allows for the identification of
counterterms in a purely algebraic way. Order by order in a perturbative
expansion we obtain automatically in the process, finite contributions, local
and nonlocal divergences. The notorious complications introduced by overlapping
divergences never enter and since no subtractions are performed (as in BPHZ)
all the counterterms are readily displayed. We illustrate with $\phi_{6}^{3}$
theory to show that our framework renders a considerable algebraic
simplification as well as explicitates the connection between renormalization
and counterterms in the Lagrangian.
