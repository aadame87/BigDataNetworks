Title: Quantum Dirac field without vacuum energy divergence
Authors: Ruo Peng Wang
Comments: 5 pages, RevTeX
\\
  A quantum Dirac field theory with no divergences of vacuum energy is
presented. The vacuum energy divergence is eliminated by removing a extra
degree of freedom of the Dirac fields. The conditions for removing the extra
degree of freedom, expressed in the form of a conservation law and an
orthogonality relation, define another spin 1/2 field with the same rest mass
that is just the antifermion field. The anticommutation relations for fermion
and antifermion fields are imposed by this conservation law. Both fermion and
antifermion fields have only states with positive energies due to the
orthogonality relation. The expressions of the charge density and the current
density are obtained. The charge conservation law is established. A form for
canical quantization applicable to both Boson and Dirac fields is introduced.
