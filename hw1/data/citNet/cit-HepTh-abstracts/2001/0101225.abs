  Based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, string theory has given exact
predictions for circular Wilson loops in U(N) ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory to all orders in a 1/N expansion. These Wilson loops can also
be derived from Random Matrix Theory. In this paper we show that the result is
generically insensitive to details of the Random Matrix Theory potential. We
also compute all higher $k$-point correlation functions, which are needed for
the evaluation of Wilson loops in arbitrary irreducible representations of
U(N).
