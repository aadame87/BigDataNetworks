  The (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow (or Polyakov) model with the additional fundamental
massless quarks is explored at finite temperature. In the case of vanishing
Yukawa coupling, it is demonstrated that the interaction of a monopole and an
antimonopole in the molecule via quark zero modes leads to the decrease of the
Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature when the number of quark
flavors is equal to one. If the number of flavors becomes larger, monopoles are
shown to exist only in the molecular phase at any temperatures exceeding a
certain exponentially small one. This means that for such a number of flavors
and at such temperatures, no fundamental matter can be confined by means of the
monopole mechanism.
