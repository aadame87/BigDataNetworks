  We obtain (3+1) and (3+2) dimensional global flat embeddings of (2+1)
uncharged and charged black strings, respectively. In particular, the charged
black string, which is the dual solution of the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli
black holes, is shown to be embedded in the same global embedding Minkowski
space structure as that of the (2+1) charged de Sitter black hole solution.
