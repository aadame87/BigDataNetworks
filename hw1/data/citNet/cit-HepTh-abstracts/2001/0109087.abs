  A new simple mechanism for SUSY breaking is proposed due to the coexistence
of BPS domain walls. It is assumed that our world is on a BPS domain wall and
that the other BPS wall breaks the SUSY preserved by our wall. This mechanism
requires no messenger fields nor complicated SUSY breaking sector on any of the
walls. We obtain an ${\cal N}=1$ model in four dimensions which has an exact
solution of a stable non-BPS configuration of two walls. We propose that the
overlap of the wave functions of the N-G fermion and those of physical fields
provides a practical method to evaluate SUSY breaking mass splitting on our
wall thanks to a low-energy theorem. This is based on our recent works
hep-th/0009023 and hep-th/0107204.
