  The Standard Model plus gravitation is produced from the Kaluza-Klein theory
of pure gravity in six dimensions with fields depending on theta and phi, two
compactified coordinates. The theory is called KK(theta, phi). When KK(theta,
phi) is quantized, the Planck masses of the massive Fourier modes, representing
the dependence upon theta and phi, are quantum corrected downward to
elemmentary particle masses, rendering them observable. KK(theta, phi) explains
the origins of the elementary particles, Maxwell's equations, the Dirac
equation, the weak interactions and the strong interactions. Quark confinement,
asymptotic freedom and chiral symmetry breaking are acheived. Ten parameters
unexplained in the Standard Model are produced from KK(theta, phi). Superweak
vectors with precisely determined masses are predicted. Testable predictions
that new leptons exist are made. In KK(theta, phi), the cosmological constant
vanishes naturally. KK(theta, phi) is trivially anomaly-free. The relationship
between quantum mechanics and general relativity is demonstrated.
