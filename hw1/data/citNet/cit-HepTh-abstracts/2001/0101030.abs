Title: Spontaneous orbifold symmetry breaking and generation of mass hierarchy
Authors: Israel Quiros
Comments: 10 pages, Revtex, no figures
\\
  A very simple mechanism is proposed that stabilizes the orbifold geometry
within the context of the Randall-Sundrum proposal for solving the hierarchy
problem. The electroweak TeV scale is generated from the Planck scale by
spontaneous breaking of the orbifold symmetry
\\
