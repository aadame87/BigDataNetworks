\\
  Stable states (particles), ghosts and unstables states (particles) are
discussed with respect to the time representations involved, their unitary
groups and the induced Hilbert spaces. Unstable particles with their decay
channels are treated as higher dimensional probability collectives with
nonabelian probability groups U(n) generalizing the individual abelian
U(1)-normalization for stable states (particles).
