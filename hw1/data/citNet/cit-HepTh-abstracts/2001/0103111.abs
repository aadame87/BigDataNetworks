  The Weyl anomaly in the Holographic Renormalisation Group as implemented
using Hamilton-Jacobi language is studied in detail. We investigate the
breakdown of the descent equations in order to isolate the Weyl anomaly of the
dual field theory close to the (UV) fixed point. We use the freedom of adding
finite terms to the renormalised effective action in order to bring the
anomalies in the expected form. We comment on different ways of describing the
bare and renormalised schemes, and on possible interpretations of the descent
equations as describing the renormalisation group flow non-perturbatively. We
find that under suitable assumptions these relations may lead to a class of
c-functions.
