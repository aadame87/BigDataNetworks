  We generate by computer a basis of invariants for the fundamental
representations of the exceptional Lie groups E(6) and E(7), up to degree 18.
We discuss the relevance of this calculation for the study of supersymmetric
gauge theories, and revisit the self-dual exceptional models. We study the
chiral ring of G(2) to degree 13, as well as a few classical groups. The
homological dimension of a ring is a natural estimator of its complexity and
provides a guideline for identifying theories that have a good chance to be
amenable to a solution.
