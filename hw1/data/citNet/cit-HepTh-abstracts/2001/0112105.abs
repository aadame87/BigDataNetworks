  Within a variational calculation we investigate the role of baryons for the
structure of dense matter in the Gross-Neveu model. We construct a trial ground
state at finite baryon density which breaks translational invariance. Its
scalar potential interpolates between widely spaced kinks and antikinks at low
density and the value zero at infinite density. Its energy is lower than the
one of the standard Fermi gas at all densities considered. This suggests that
the discrete gamma_5 symmetry of the Gross-Neveu model does not get restored in
a first order phase transition at finite density, at variance with common
wisdom.
