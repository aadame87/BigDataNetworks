  We consider the brane universe in the bulk background of the charged
topological AdS black holes. The evolution of the brane universe is described
by the Friedmann equations for a flat or an open FRW-universe containing
radiation and stiff matter. We find that the temperature and entropy of the
dual CFT are simply expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter and its time
derivative, and the Friedmann equations coincide with thermodynamic formulas of
the dual CFT at the moment when the brane crosses the black hole horizon. We
obtain the generalized Cardy-Verlinde formula for the CFT with an R-charge, for
any values of the curvature parameter k in the Friedmann equations.
