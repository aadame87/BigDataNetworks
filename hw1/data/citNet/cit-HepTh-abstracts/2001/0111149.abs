  The formalism of spacetime dependent lagrangians developed in Ref.1 is
applied to the Sine Gordon and massive Thirring models.It is shown that the
well-known equivalence of these models (in the context of weak-strong duality)
can be understood in this approach from the same considerations as described in
[1] for electromagnetic duality. A further new result is that all these can be
naturally linked to the fact that the holographic principle has analogues at
length scales much larger than quantum gravity. There is also the possibility
of {\it noncommuting coodinates} residing on the boundaries. PACS: 11.15.-q:
