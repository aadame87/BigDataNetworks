  We present a short review of adelic quantum mechanics pointing out its
non-Archimedean and noncommutative aspects. In particular, $p$-adic path
integral and adelic quantum cosmology are considered. Some similarities between
$p$-adic analysis and q-analysis are noted. The $p$-adic Moyal product is
introduced.
