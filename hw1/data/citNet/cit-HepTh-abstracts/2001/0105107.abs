  We call superpartitions the indices of the eigenfunctions of the
supersymmetric extension of the trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model.
We obtain an ordering on superpartitions from the explicit action of the
model's Hamiltonian on monomial superfunctions. This allows to define Jack
superpolynomials as the unique eigenfunctions of the model that decompose
triangularly, with respect to this ordering, on the basis of monomial
superfunctions. This further leads to a simple and explicit determinantal
expression for the Jack superpolynomials.
