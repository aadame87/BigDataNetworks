  In this paper, we describe a method for obtaining the nonabelian
Seiberg-Witten map for any gauge group and to any order in theta. The equations
defining the Seiberg-Witten map are expressed using a coboundary operator, so
that they can be solved by constructing a corresponding homotopy operator. The
ambiguities, of both the gauge and covariant type, which arise in this map are
manifest in our formalism.
