  It is shown that an (n-1)-dimensional inflating brane world instantonically
created from nothing can exist in the region beyond the Rindler horizon of the
Lorentzian spacetime associated with another inflating brane world in n
dimensions which is also instantonically created from nothing. Generalizing
this construction we obtain an unbounded from above tower of successive brane
worlds, each having one more dimension than the one which it nests and one less
dimension than the one which nests it.
