  We consider a large coupling limit of a Born-Infeld action in a curved
background of an arbitrary metric and a constant two form field. Following
hep-th/0009061, we go to the Hamiltonian description. The Hamiltonian can be
dualized and the dual action admits a string-like configuration as its
solution. We interpret it as a closed string configuration. The procedure can
be viewed as a novel way of bringing out the appropriate degrees of freedom, a
closed string, for a open string under the strong coupling limit. We argue that
this interpretation implies a large number of dual pairs of gauge and gravity
theories whose particular examples are AdS/CFT and matrix theory conjectures.
