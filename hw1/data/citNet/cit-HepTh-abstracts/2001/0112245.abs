  The character of the principal series of representations of SL(n,R) is
evaluated by using Gel'fand and Naimark's definition of character. This
representation is realized in the space of functions defined on the right coset
space of SL(n,R) with respect to the subgroup of real triangular matrices. This
form of the representations considerably simplifies the problem of
determination of the integral kernel of the group ring which is fundamental in
the Gel'fand-Naimark theory of character. An important feature of the principal
series of representations is that the `elliptic' elements of SL(n,R) do not
contribute to its character.
