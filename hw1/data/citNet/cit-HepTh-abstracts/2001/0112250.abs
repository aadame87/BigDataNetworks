Title: On algebraic geometric and computer algebra aspects of mirror symmetry
Authors: Nikolaj M. Glazunov
Comments: 11 pages, CAAP'2001 (Dubna), SymmNMPh'2001 (Kiev)

  We survey some algebraic geometric aspects of mirror symmetry and duality in
string theory. Some applications of computer algebra to algebraic geometry and
string theory are shortly reviewed.
