  We study the localization properties of bulk form potentials on dilatonic
domain walls. We find that bulk form potentials of any ranks can be localized
as form potentials of the same ranks or one lower ranks, for any values of the
dilaton coupling parameter. For large enough values of the dilaton coupling
parameter, bulk form potentials of any ranks can be localized as form
potentials of both the same ranks and one lower ranks.
