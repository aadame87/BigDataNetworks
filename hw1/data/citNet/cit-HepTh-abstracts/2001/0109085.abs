  The division algebras R, C, H, O are used to construct and analyze the
N=1,2,4,8 supersymmetric extensions of the KdV hamiltonian equation. In
particular a global N=8 super-KdV system is introduced and shown to admit a
Poisson bracket structure given by the "Non-Associative N=8 Superconformal
Algebra".
