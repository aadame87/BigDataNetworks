  The local action of an SU(2) gauge theory in general covariant Abelian gauges
and the associated equivariant BRST symmetry that guarantees the perturbative
renormalizability of the model are given. A global SL(2,R) symmetry of the
model is spontaneously broken by ghost-antighost condensation at arbitrarily
small coupling. This leads to propagators that are finite at Euclidean momenta
for all elementary fields except the Abelian ``photon''. Ward Identities show
that the symmetry breaking gives rise to massless BRST-quartets with ghost
numbers (1,2,-2,-1) and (0,1,-1,0). The latter quartet is interpreted as due to
an Abelian Higgs mechanism in the dual description of the model.
