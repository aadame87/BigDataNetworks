  We argue that eleven dimensional supergravity can be described by a
non-linear realisation based on the group E_{11}. This requires a formulation
of eleven dimensional supergravity in which the gravitational degrees of
freedom are described by two fields which are related by duality. We show the
existence of such a description of gravity.
