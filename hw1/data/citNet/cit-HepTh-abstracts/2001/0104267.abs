Title: A new exactly solvable Eckart-type potential
Authors: Elso Drigo Filho and Regina Maria Ricotta
Comments: Latex, 9 pages
\\
  A new exact analytically solvable Eckart-type potential is presented, a
generalisation of the Hulthen potential. The study through Supersymmetric
Quantum Mechanics is presented together with the hierarchy of Hamiltonians and
the shape invariance property.
