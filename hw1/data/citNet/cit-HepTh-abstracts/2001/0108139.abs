  Two simple proofs are presented for the first order virial expansion of the
self-energy of a particle moving through a medium, characterised by temperature
and/or chemical potential(s). One is based on the virial expansion of the
self-energy operator itself, while the other is on the analysis of its Feynman
diagrams in configuration space.
