  We find regular string duals of three dimensional N=1 SYM with a Chern-Simons
interaction at level k for SO and Sp gauge groups. Using the string dual we
exactly reproduce the conjectured pattern of supersymmetry breaking proposed by
Witten by showing that there is dynamical supersymmetry breaking for k<h/2
while supersymmetry remains unbroken for k>= h/2, where h is the dual Coxeter
number of the gauge group. We also find regular string duals of four
dimensional N=1 SYM for SO and Sp gauge groups and exactly reproduce the
expected pattern of chiral symmetry breaking Z_{2h}--> Z_2 by analyzing the
symmetries of the string solution.
