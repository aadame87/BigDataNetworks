Title: Essential and inessential features of Hawking radiation
Authors: Matt Visser (Washington University in Saint Louis)
Comments: JHEP style; 17 pages

  There are numerous derivations of the Hawking effect available in the
literature. They emphasise different features of the process, and sometimes
make markedly different physical assumptions. This article presents a
``minimalist'' argument, and strips the derivation of as much excess baggage as
possible. All that is really necessary is quantum physics plus a slowly
evolving future apparent horizon (*not* an event horizon). In particular,
neither the Einstein equations nor Bekenstein entropy are necessary (nor even
useful) in deriving Hawking radiation.
