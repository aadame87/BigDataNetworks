  We consider compact four-dimensional ${\bf Z_N}\times {\bf Z_M}$ type IIB
orientifolds, for certain values of $N$ and $M$. We allow the additional
feature of discrete torsion and discuss the modification of the consistency
conditions arising from tadpole cancellation. We point out the differences
between the cases with and without discrete torsion.
