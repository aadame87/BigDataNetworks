  The lowest order quantum corrections to the effective action arising from
quantized massive fermion fields in the Randall-Sundrum background spacetime
are computed. The boundary conditions and their relation with gauge invariance
are examined in detail. The possibility of Wilson loop symmetry breaking in
brane models is also analysed. The self-consistency requirements, previously
considered in the case of a quantized bulk scalar field, are extended to
include the contribution from massive fermions. It is shown that in this case
it is possible to stabilize the radius of the extra dimensions but it is not
possible to simultaneously solve the hierarchy problem, unless the brane
tensions are dramatically fine tuned, supporting previous claims.
