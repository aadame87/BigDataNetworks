  Using the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism we provide a detailed analysis of the
NS sector of boundary superstring field theory. We construct explicitly the
relevant BV structure and derive the master action. Furthermore, we show that
this action is exactly equal to the superdisk worldsheet partition function as
was recently conjectured.
