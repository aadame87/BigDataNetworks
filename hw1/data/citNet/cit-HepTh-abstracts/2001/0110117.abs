  We discuss the asymptotic dynamical evolution of spatially homogeneous
brane-world cosmological models close to the initial singularity. We find that
generically the cosmological singularity is isotropic in Bianchi type IX
brane-world models and consequently these models do not exhibit Mixmaster or
chaotic-like behaviour close to the initial singularity. We argue that this is
typical of more general cosmological models in the brane-world scenario. In
particular, we show that an isotropic singularity is a past-attractor in all
orthogonal Bianchi models and is a local past-attractor in a class of
inhomogeneous brane-world models.
