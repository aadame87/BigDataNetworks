  We construct an explicit class of solutions of type IIB supergravity that is
a smooth deformation of the 3-brane class of solutions. The solution is
nonsupersymmetric and involves nontrivial dilaton and axion fields as well as
the standard 5-form field strength. One of the main features of the solution is
that for large values of the radius the deformation is small and it
asymptotically approaches the undeformed 3-brane solution, signaling a
restoration of conformal invariance in the UV for the dual gauge theory. We
suggest that the supergravity deformation corresponds to a massive deformation
on the dual gauge theory and consequently the deformed theory has the
undeformed one as an ultraviolet fixed point. In cases where the original
3-brane solution preserves some amount of supersymmetry we suggest that the
gauge theory interpretation is that of soft supersymmetry breaking. We discuss
the deformation for D3-branes on the conifold and the generalized conifold
explicitly. We show that the semiclassical behavior of the Wilson loop suggests
that the corresponding gauge theory duals are confining.
