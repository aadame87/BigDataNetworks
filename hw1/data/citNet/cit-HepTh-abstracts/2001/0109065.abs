  In a recent paper hep-th/0109064, quarter-BPS chiral primaries were
constructed in the fully interacting four dimensional N=4 Super-Yang-Mills
theory with gauge group SU(N). These operators are annihilated by four
supercharges, and at order g^2 have protected scaling dimension and
normalization. Here, we compute three-point functions involving these
quarter-BPS operators along with half-BPS operators. The combinatorics of the
problem is rather involved, and we consider the following special cases: (1)
correlators < half half BPS > of two half-BPS primaries with an arbitrary
chiral primary; (2) certain classes of < half quarter quarter > and < quarter
quarter quarter > three-point functions; (3) three-point functions involving
the Delta < 8 operators found in hep-th/0109064; (4) < half quarter quarter>
correlators with the special quarter-BPS operator made of single and double
trace operators only. The analysis in cases (1)-(3) is valid for general N,
while (4) is a large N approximation. Order g^2 corrections to all three-point
functions considered in this paper are found to vanish.
  In the AdS/CFT correspondence, quarter-BPS chiral primaries are dual to
threshold bound states of elementary supergravity excitations. We present a
supergravity discussion of two- and three-point correlators involving these
bound states.
