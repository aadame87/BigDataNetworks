  We investigate systems of real scalar fields in bidimensional spacetime,
dealing with potentials that are small modifications of potentials that admit
supersymmetric extensions. The modifications are controlled by a real
parameter, which allows implementing a perturbation procedure when such
parameter is small. The approach allows obtaining the energy and topological
charge in closed forms, up to first order in the parameter. We illustrate the
procedure with some examples. In particular, we show how to remove the
degeneracy in energy for the one-field and the two-field solutions that appear
in a model of two real scalar fields.
