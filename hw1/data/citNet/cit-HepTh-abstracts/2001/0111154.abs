  We study condensation of closed string tachyons living on defects, such as
orbifold fixed planes and Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes. We argue that the high
energy density of localized states decreases in the process of condensation of
such tachyons. In some cases this means that $c_{eff}$ decreases along the
flow; in others, $c_{eff}$ remains constant and the decreasing quantity is a
closed string analog, $g_{cl}$, of the ``boundary entropy'' of D-branes. We
discuss the non-supersymmetric orbifolds $C/Z_n$ and $C^2/Z_n$. In the first
case tachyon condensation decreases $n$ and in some cases connects type II and
type 0 vacua. In the second case non-singular orbifolds are related by tachyon
condensation to both singular and non-singular ones. We verify that $g_{cl}$
decreases in flows between non-singular orbifolds. The main tools in the
analysis are the structure of the chiral ring of the perturbed theory, the
geometry of the resolved orbifold singularities, and the throat description of
singular conformal field theories.
