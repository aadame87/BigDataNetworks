  Within a $D$-dimensional superstring spacetime, we construct a
non-supersymmetric brane-world with localized gravity and large hierarchy
between the scale in the bulk, $M_D$, and the scale on the brane, $M_{D-2}$.
The localization of gravity and the large hierarchy are both guaranteed by the
presence of non-trivial stringy moduli, such as the axion-dilaton system for
the Type-IIB string theory.
