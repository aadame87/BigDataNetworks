  We investigate the charged Schwarzschild-Anti-deSitter (SAdS) BH
thermodynamics in 5d Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with electromagnetic field.
The Hawking-Page phase transitions between SAdS BH and pure AdS space are
studied. The corresponding phase diagrams (with critical line defined by GB
term coefficient and electric charge) are drawn. The possibility to account for
higher derivative Maxwell terms is mentioned.
 In frames of proposed dS/CFT correspondence it is demonstrated that brane
gravity maybe localized similarly to AdS/CFT.
 SdS BH thermodynamics in 5d Einstein and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is
considered. The corresponding (complicated) surface counterterms are found and
used to get the conserved BH mass, free energy and entropy. The interesting
feature of of higher derivative gravity is the possibility for negative (or
zero) SdS (or SAdS) BH entropy which depends on the parameters of higher
derivative terms. We speculate that the appearence of negative entropy may
indicate a new type instability where a transition between SdS (SAdS) BH with
negative entropy to SAdS (SdS) BH with positive entropy would occur.
