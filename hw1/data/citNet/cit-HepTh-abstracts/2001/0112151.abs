  A supersymmetric formulation of a three-dimensional SYM-Chern-Simons theory
using light-cone quantization is presented, and the supercharges are calculated
in light-cone gauge. The theory is dimensionally reduced by requiring all
fields to be independent of the transverse dimension. The result is a
non-trivial two-dimensional supersymmetric theory with an adjoint scalar and an
adjoint fermion. We perform a numerical simulation of this SYM-Chern-Simons
theory in 1+1 dimensions using SDLCQ (Supersymmetric Discrete Light-Cone
Quantization). We find that the character of the bound states of this theory is
very different from previously considered two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge
theories. The low-energy bound states of this theory are very ``QCD-like.'' The
wave functions of some of the low mass states have a striking valence
structure. We present the valence and sea parton structure functions of these
states. In addition, we identify BPS-like states which are almost independent
of the coupling. Their masses are proportional to their parton number in the
large-coupling limit.
