Title: Realizing the Quantum Hall System in String Theory
Authors: Simeon Hellerman and Leonard Susskind
Comments: 8 Pages, no figures

  In a recent paper Bernevig, Brodie, Susskind and Toumbas constructed a brane
realization of the Quantum Hall fluid. Since then it has been realized that the
Quantum Hall system is very closely related to non--commutative Chern Simons
theory and this suggests alternative brane constructions which we believe are
more reliable and clear. In this paper a brane construction is given for the
non--commutative Chern Simons Matrix formulation of the Quantum Hall system as
described by in recent papers by Susskind, Polychronakos and by Hellerman and
Van Raamsdonk. The system is a generalized version of Berkooz's ``Rigid Light
Cone Membrane which occurs as an excition of the DLCQ description of the
M5--brane in a background 3--form field. The original construction of Berkooz
corresponds to the fully filled $\nu =1$ state of the QH system. To change the
filling fraction to $\nu = 1/(k+1)$ a system of $k$ background D8-branes is
required. Quasi--hole excitations can be generated by passing a D6-brane though
the Rigid Membrane.
