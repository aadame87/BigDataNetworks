  At sufficiently low energy the dynamics of a string web is dominated by zero
modes involving rigid motion of the internal strings. The dimension of the
associated moduli space equals the maximal number of internal faces in the web.
The generic web moduli space has boundaries and multiple branches, and for webs
with three or more faces the geometry is curved. Webs can also be studied in a
lift to M-theory, where a string web is replaced by a membrane wrapped on a
holomorphic curve in spacetime. In this case the moduli space is complexified
and admits a Kaehler metric.
