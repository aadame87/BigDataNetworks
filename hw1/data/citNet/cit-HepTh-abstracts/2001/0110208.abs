Title: Dark Matter, Quantum Gravity, Vacuum Energy, and Lorentz Invariance
Authors: Roland E. Allen
Comments: 5 pages; to be published in the proceedings of the Second Meeting on
  CPT and Lorentz Symmetry, edited by V. A. Kostelecky (World Scientific,
  Singapore, 2002)
\\
  We discuss the problems of dark matter, quantum gravity, and vacuum energy
within the context of a theory for which Lorentz invariance is not postulated,
but instead emerges as a natural consequence in the physical regimes where it
has been tested.
