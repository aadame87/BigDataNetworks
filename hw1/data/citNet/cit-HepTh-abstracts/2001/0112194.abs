Title: Dirac Quantization of Some Singular Theories
Authors: A Shirzad & P Moyassari
Comments: 12 pages,latex
\\
  Analyzing the constraint structure of electrodynamics, massive vector bosons,
Dirac fermions and electrodynamics coupled to fermions, we show that Dirac
quantization method leads to appropriate creation-annihilation algebra among
the Forier coefficients of the fields.
