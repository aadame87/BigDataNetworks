Title: Stringy Spacetime Uncertainty as an Alternative to Inflation

  In this paper we point out that the spacetime uncertainty relation proposed
for string theory has strong cosmological implications that can solve the
flatness problem and the horizon problem without the need of inflation. We make
minimal assumptions about the very early universe.
