  The multiplicative anomaly, recently introduced in QFT, plays a fundamental
role in solving some mathematical inconsistencies of the widely used
zeta-function regularization method. Its physical relevance is still an open
question and is here analyzed in the light of a non-perturbative method. Even
in this approach the ``different physics'' seems to hold and not to be easily
removable by renormalization.
