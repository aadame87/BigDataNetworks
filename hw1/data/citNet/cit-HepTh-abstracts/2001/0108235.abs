  Representations of four dimensional superconformal groups are constructed as
fields on many different superspaces, including super Minkowski space, chiral
superspace, harmonic superspace and analytic superspace. Any unitary
irreducible representation can be given as a field on any one of these spaces
if we include fields which transform under supergroups. In particular, on
analytic superspaces, the fields are unconstrained. One can obtain all
representations of the N=4 complex superconformal group $PSL(4|4)$ with integer
dilation weight from copies of the Maxwell multiplet on $(4,2,2)$ analytic
superspace. This construction is compared with the oscillator construction and
it is shown that there is a natural correspondence between the oscillator
construction of superconformal representations and those carried by superfields
on analytic superspace.
