  Following hep-th/0109127, we show that a certain class of BPS naked
singularities (superstars) found in compactifications of M-theory can be
interpreted as being composed of giant gravitons. More specifically, we study
superstars which are asymptotically AdS_7 x S^4 and AdS_4 x S^7 and show that
these field configurations can be interpreted as being sourced by continuous
distributions of spherical M2- and M5-branes, respectively, which carry
internal momenta and have expanded on the spherical component of the
space-time.
