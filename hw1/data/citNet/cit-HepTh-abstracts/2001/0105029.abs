  Siegel's action is generalized to the D=2(p+1) (p even) dimensional
space-time. The investigation of self-duality of chiral p-forms is extended to
the momentum frame, using Siegel's action of chiral bosons in two space-time
dimensions and its generalization in higher dimensions as examples. The whole
procedure of investigation is realized in the momentum space which relates to
the configuration space through the Fourier transformation of fields. These
actions correspond to non-local Lagrangians in the momentum frame. The
self-duality of them with respect to dualization of chiral fields is uncovered.
The relationship between two self-dual tensors in momentum space, whose similar
form appears in configuration space, plays an important role in the
calculation, that is, its application realizes solving algebraically an
integral equation.
