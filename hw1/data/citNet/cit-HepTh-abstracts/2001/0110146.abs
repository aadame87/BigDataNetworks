  We argue that two four-dimensional strongly coupled superconformal field
theories, on the Higgs branch in certain large N limits, become respectively
(2,0) theory and (1,1) little string theory in six dimensions. We identify the
spectrum of states responsible for the generation of the two extra dimensions
and string winding modes. We establish the equivalence using orbifold
realizations of the field theories and exploiting string dualities. We also
speculate on deconstructions of M-theory.
