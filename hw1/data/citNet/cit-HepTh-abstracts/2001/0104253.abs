  We formulate the problem of finding self-dual Hamiltonians (associated with
integrable systems) as deformations of free systems given on various symplectic
manifolds and discuss several known explicit examples, including recently found
double elliptic Hamiltonians. We consider as basic the notion of self-duality,
while the duality in integrable systems (of the Toda/Calogero/Ruijsenaars type)
comes as a derivative notion (degenerations of self-dual systems). This is a
talk presented at the Workshop "Classical and Quantum Integrable Systems",
Protvino, January, 2001.
