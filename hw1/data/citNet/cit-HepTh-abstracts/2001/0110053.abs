  We study the SU(2) electroweak model in which the standard Yang-Mills
coupling is supplemented by a Born-Infeld term. The deformation of the
sphaleron and bisphaleron solutions due to the Born-Infeld term is investigated
and new branches of solutions are exhibited. Especially, we find a new branch
of solutions connecting the Born-Infeld sphaleron to the first solution of the
Kerner-Gal'tsov series.
