  We study the warped geometry of heterotic M-Theory in five dimensions where
five-branes are included in the bulk. Five-branes wrapping holomorphic curves
lead to BPS configurations where the junction conditions are automatically
satisfied. We consider five-branes wrapped around non-supersymmetric cycles and
show that the configuration is unstable. We describe explicitly the resulting
time-dependent geometry where the bulk five-branes move towards the
Horova-Witten boundary walls. The five-branes collide with the boundary walls
in a finite time resulting in the restoration of supersymmetry.
