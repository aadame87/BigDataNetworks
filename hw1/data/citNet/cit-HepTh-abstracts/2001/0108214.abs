  We propose a general scheme to construct multiple Lagrangians for completely
integrable non-linear evolution equations that admit multi- Hamiltonian
structure. The recursion operator plays a fundamental role in this
construction. We use a conserved quantity higher/lower than the Hamiltonian in
the potential part of the new Lagrangian and determine the corresponding
kinetic terms by generating the appropriate momentum map. This leads to some
remarkable new developments. We show that nonlinear evolutionary systems that
admit $N$-fold first order local Hamiltonian structure can be cast into
variational form with $2N-1$ Lagrangians which will be local functionals of
Clebsch potentials. This number increases to $3N-2$ when the Miura
transformation is invertible. Furthermore we construct a new Lagrangian for
polytropic gas dynamics in $1+1$ dimensions which is a {\it local} functional
of the physical field variables, namely density and velocity, thus dispensing
with the necessity of introducing Clebsch potentials entirely. This is a
consequence of bi-Hamiltonian structure with a compatible pair of first and
third order Hamiltonian operators derived from Sheftel's recursion operator.
