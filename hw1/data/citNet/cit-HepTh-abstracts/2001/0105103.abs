  We consider adelic approach to strings and spatial noncommutativity. Path
integral method to string amplitudes is emphasized. Uncertainties in spatial
measurements in quantum gravity are related to noncommutativity between
coordinates. p-Adic and adelic Moyal products are introduced. In particular,
p-adic and adelic counterparts of some real noncommutative scalar solitons are
constructed.
