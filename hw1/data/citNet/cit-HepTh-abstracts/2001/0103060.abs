Title: Geometric Stability of Brane-worlds

  The stability conditions for coordinate gauge independent perturbations of
brane-worlds are analyzed. It is shown that, these conditions lead to the
Einstein-Hilbert dynamics and to a confined gauge potential, independently of
models and metric ansatzes. The size of the extra dimensions are estimated
without assuming a fixed topology. The quantum modes corresponding to high
frequency gravitational waves are defined through a canonical structure.
