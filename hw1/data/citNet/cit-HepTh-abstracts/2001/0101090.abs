  We apply the supplementation trick [26] to the Green-Schwarz superstring. For
type IIB theory both first and second class constraints are covariantly
separated and then arranged into irreducible sets in the initial formulation.
For N=1 Green-Schwarz superstring we propose a modified action which is
equivalent to the initial one. Fermionic first and second class constraints are
covariantly separated, the first class constraints turn out to be irreducible.
We discuss also equations of motion in the covariant gauge for
$\kappa$-symmetry. For type IIA theory the same modification leads to
formulation with irreducible second class constraints.
