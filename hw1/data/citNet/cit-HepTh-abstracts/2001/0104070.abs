Title: Supersymmetric Potentials in Einstein-Cartan-Brans-Dicke Cosmology

\\
  Cosmological inflation is discussed in the realm of
Einstein-Cartan-Brans-Dicke (ECBD) gravity by constructing an effective
inflaton potential and computing the number of e-folds.It is shown that
spin-torsion density contributes to a decrease on the number of e-folds of
inflation when the ratio of spin-torsion density to matter density is
aprecciable as happens in the Early Universe.Quantum fluctuations of spin and
inflatons are also investigated.Our results seems to be in agreement with
Palle's proposal that quantum fluctuations of spin may trigger the primordial
era of the universe.The main esult of the paper is the appearence of a
supersymmetric type inflaton potential from the ECBD gravity where the
coefficient of the one-loop type correction is a constant spin-torsion density.
