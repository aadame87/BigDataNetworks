  We consider supersymmetric models in 5-dimensional space-time compactified on
S**1/Z(2) orbifold where N=2 supersymmetry is explicitly broken down to N=1 by
the orbifold projection. We find that the residual N=1 supersymmetry is broken
spontaneously by a stable classical wall-like field configurations which can
appear even in the simple models discussed. We also consider some simple models
of bulk fields interacting with those localized on the 4-dimensional boundary
wall where N=1 supersymmetry can survive in a rather non-trivial way.
