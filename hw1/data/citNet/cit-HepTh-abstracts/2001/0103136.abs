  We describe, on a few instructive examples, a systematic way of deducing the
superfield equations of motion of superbranes in the approach of partial
breaking of global supersymmetry (PBGS) from the nonlinear-realizations
formalism. For D-branes these equations simultaneously represent the
appropriate supersymmetric Born-Infeld theories. We also discuss how to
construct an off-shell superfield action for the $N=2, d=4$ Dirac-Born-Infeld
theory corresponding to the partial supersymmetry breaking $N=4 \to N=2$ in
$d=4$.
