  We consider the construction of fluxbranes in certain curved geometries,
generalizing the familiar construction of the Melvin fluxtube as a quotient of
flat space. The resulting configurations correspond to fluxbranes wrapped on
cycles in curved spaces. The non-trivial transverse geometry leads in some
instances to solutions with asymptotically constant dilaton profiles. We
describe explicitly several supersymmetric solutions of this kind. The
solutions inherit some properties from their flat space cousins, like flux
periodicity. Interestingly type IIA/0A fluxbrane duality holds near the core of
these fluxbranes, but does not persist in the asymptotic region, precisely
where it would contradict perturbative inequivalence of IIA/0A theories.
