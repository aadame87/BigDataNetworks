  We present the N=2 supersymmetric formulation for the classical and quantum
dynamics of a nonrelativistic charged particle on a curved surface in the
presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. For a particle moving on a
constant-curvature surface in a constant magnetic field, our Hamiltonian
possesses the shape-invariance property in addition. On the surface of a sphere
and also on the hyperbolic plane, we exploit the supersymmetry and
shape-invariance properties to obtain complete solutions to the corresponding
quantum mechanical problems.
