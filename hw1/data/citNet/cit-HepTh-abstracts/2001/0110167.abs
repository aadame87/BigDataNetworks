  A long-standing problem of theoretical physics is the exceptionally small
value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120}$ measured in natural
Planckian units. Here we derive this tiny number from a toroidal string
cosmology based on closed strings. In this picture the dark energy arises from
the correlation between momentum and winding modes that for short distances has
an exponential fall-off with increasing values of the momenta.The freeze-out by
the expansion of the background universe for these transplanckian modes may be
interpreted as a frozen condensate of the closed-string modes in the three
non-compactified spatial dimensions.
