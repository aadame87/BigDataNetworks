  Motivated by applications of twisted current algebras in description of the
entropy of $Ads_3$ black hole, we investigate the simplest twisted current
algebra $sl(3,{\bf C})^{(2)}_k$. Free field representation of the twisted
algebra and the corresponding twisted Sugawara energy-momentum tensor are
obtained by using three $(\beta,\gamma)$ pairs and two scalar fields. Primary
fields and two screening currents of the first kind are presented.
