  We construct integrable generalizations of the elliptic
Calogero-Sutherland-Moser model of particles with spin, involving
noncommutative spin interactions. The spin coupling potential is a modular
function and, generically, breaks the global spin symmetry of the model down to
a product of U(1) phase symmetries. Previously known models are recovered as
special cases.
