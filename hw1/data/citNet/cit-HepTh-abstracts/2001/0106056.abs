  We recast the Podle\`s spheres in the noncommutative physics context by
showing that they can be regarded as slices along the time coordinate of the
different regions of the quantum Minkowski space-time. The investigation of the
transformations of the quantum sphere states under the left coaction of the
${\cal SO}_{q}(3)$ group leads to a decomposition of the transformed Hilbert
space states in terms of orthogonal subspaces exhibiting the periodicity of the
quantum sphere states.
