  We investigate static axially symmetric monopole and black hole solutions
with magnetic charge n > 1 in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. For vanishing
and small Higgs selfcoupling, multimonopole solutions are gravitationally
bound. Their mass per unit charge is lower than the mass of the n=1 monopole.
For large Higgs selfcoupling only a repulsive phase exists. The static axially
symmetric hairy black hole solutions possess a deformed horizon with constant
surface gravity. We consider their properties in the isolated horizon
framework, interpreting them as bound states of monopoles and black holes.
Representing counterexamples to the ``no-hair'' conjecture, these black holes
are neither uniquely characterized by their horizon area and horizon charge.
