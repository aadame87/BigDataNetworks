  We study a scalar-tensor bimetric cosmology in the Randall-Sundrum model with
one positive tension brane, where the biscalar field is assumed to be confined
on the brane. The effective Friedmann equations on the brane are obtained and
analyzed. We comment on resolution of cosmological problems in this bimetric
model.
