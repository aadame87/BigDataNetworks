  We analyze the anti-de Sitter (AdS) superparticle and superstring systems
described in terms of supermatrix valued coordinates proposed by Roiban and
Siegel. This approach gives simple symmetry transformations and equations of
motion. We examine their kappa-transformations, infinite reducibility and
kappa-gauge fixing conditions. A closed first class constraint set for the AdS
superparticle is GL(4|4) covariant and keeping superconformal symmetry
manifestly. For the AdS superstring $\sigma$-dependence breaks the GL(4|4)
covariance, where supercovariant derivatives and currents satisfy the
inhomogeneous GL(4|4). A closed first class constraint set for the AdS
superstring turns out to be the same as the one for a superstring in flat
space, namely ABCD constraints.
