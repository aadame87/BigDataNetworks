  We study the structure of the tenacious (existing for all values of masses of
the matter fields) BPS domain walls interpolating between different chirally
asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD in the limit of large masses.
 We show that the wall consists in this case of three layers: two outer layers
form a ``coat'' with the characteristic size determined by \Lambda_{SYM} and
there is also the core with width of order of inverse mass. The core always
carries a significant fraction of the total wall energy. This fraction depends
on $N_f$ and on the ``windings'' of the matter fields.
