  Higher derivative bulk gravity (without Riemann tensor square term) admits
AdS-Schwarzschild black hole as exact solution. It is shown that induced brane
geometry on such background is open, flat or closed FRW radiation dominated
Universe. Higher derivative terms contributions appear in the Hawking
temperature, entropy and Hubble parameter via the redefinition of 5-dimensional
gravitational constant and AdS scale parameter. These higher derivative terms
do not destroy the AdS-dual description of radiation represented by
strongly-coupled CFT. Cardy-Verlinde formula which expresses cosmological
entropy as square root from other parameters and entropies is derived in $R^2$
gravity. The corresponding cosmological entropy bounds are briefly discussed.
