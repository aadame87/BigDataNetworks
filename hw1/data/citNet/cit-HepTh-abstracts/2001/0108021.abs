  It is shown that the $F_4$ rational and trigonometric integrable systems are
exactly-solvable for {\it arbitrary} values of the coupling constants. Their
spectra are found explicitly while eigenfunctions by pure algebraic means. For
both systems new variables are introduced in which the Hamiltonian has an
algebraic form being also (block)-triangular. These variables are invariant
with respect to the Weyl group of $F_4$ root system and can be obtained by
averaging over an orbit of the Weyl group. Alternative way of finding these
variables exploiting a property of duality of the $F_4$ model is presented. It
is demonstrated that in these variables the Hamiltonian of each model can be
expressed as a quadratic polynomial in the generators of some
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of differential operators in a
finite-dimensional representation. Both Hamiltonians preserve the same flag of
polynomials and each subspace of the flag coincides with the finite-dimensional
representation space of this algebra. Quasi-exactly-solvable generalization of
the rational $F_4$ model depending on two continuous and one discrete
parameters is found.
