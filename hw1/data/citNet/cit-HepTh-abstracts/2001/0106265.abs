  We examine the stability of ${\rm AdS}_p \times {\rm S}^n \times {\rm
S}^{q-n}$. The initial data constructed by De Wolfe et al \cite{Gary} has been
carefully analyised and we have confirmed that there is no lower bound for the
total mass for $q< 9$. The effective action on ${\rm AdS}_p$ has been derived
for dilatonic compactification of the system to describe the non-linear
fluctuation of the background space-time. The stability is discussed applying
the positive energy theorem to the effective theory on AdS, which again shows
the stability for $q \geq 9$.
