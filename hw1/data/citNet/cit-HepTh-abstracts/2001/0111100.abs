  In the present talk we briefly demonstrate an elegant and effective technique
for calculation of the trace expansion in the derivatives of background fields.
One of main advantages of the technique is manifestly (super)symmetrical and
gauge invariant form of expressions on all stages of calculations. Other
advantage is the universality of the calculation method. Some particular
examples and results are presented.
