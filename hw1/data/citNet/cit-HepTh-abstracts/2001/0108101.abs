  We assemble a few remarks on the supergravity solution of hep-th/0007191,
whose UV asymptotic form was previously found in hep-th/0002159. First, by
normalizing the R-R fluxes, we compare the logarithmic flow of couplings in
supergravity with that in field theory, and find exact agreement. We also write
the 3-form field strength $G_3 = F_3 - \tau H_3$ present in the solution in a
manifestly SO(4) invariant $(2,1)$ form. In addition, we discuss various issues
related to the chiral symmetry breaking and wrapped branes.
