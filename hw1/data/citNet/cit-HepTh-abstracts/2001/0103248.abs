  We study the averaged action of the Randall-Sundrum model with a time
dependent metric ansatz. It can be reformulated in terms of a Brans-Dicke
action with time dependent Newton's constant. We show that the physics of early
universe, particularly inflation, is governed by the Brans-Dicke theory. The
Brans-Dicke scalar, however, quickly settles to its equilibrium value and
decouples from the post-inflationary cosmology. The deceleration parameter is
negative to start with but changes sign before the Brans-Dicke scalar settles
to its equilibrium value. Consequently, the brane metric smoothly exits
inflation. We have also studied the slow-roll inflation in our model and
investigated the spectra of the density perturbation generated by the radion
field and find them consistent with the current observations.
