  The minimal embedding of the Standard Model in type I string theory is
described. The SU(3) color and SU(2) weak interactions arise from two different
collections of branes. The correct prediction of the weak angle is obtained for
a string scale of 6-8 TeV. Two Higgs doublets are necessary and proton
stability is guaranteed. It predicts two massive vector bosons with masses at
the TeV scale, as well as a new superweak interaction.
