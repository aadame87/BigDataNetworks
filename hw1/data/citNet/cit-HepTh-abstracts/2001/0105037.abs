  We consider quantum electrodynamics with an additional Lorentz- and
CPT-violating axial-vector term in the fermionic sector and discuss the
possibility that radiative corrections induce a Lorentz- and CPT-violating
Chern-Simons-like term for the gauge field. From the requirement of causality
and the assumed validity of perturbation theory, we conclude that the induced
Chern-Simons-like term must be absent in the full quantum field theory.
