Title: Quantum Field Theory on the q-deformed Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: H. Steinacker
Comments: 8 pages, lecture given at the XXXVII Karpacz Winter School "New
  Developments in Fundamental Interactions Theories" (February 6-15, 2000,
  Karpacz, Poland). To be published in Proceedings

  We discuss the second quantization of scalar field theory on the q-deformed
fuzzy sphere S^2_{q,N} for q \in \R, using a path-integral approach. We find
quantum field theories which are manifestly covariant under U_q(su(2)), have a
smooth limit q -> 1, and satisfy positivity and twisted bosonic symmetry
properties. Using a Drinfeld twist, they are equivalent to ordinary but
slightly "nonlocal" QFT's on the undeformed fuzzy sphere, which are covariant
under SU(2).
