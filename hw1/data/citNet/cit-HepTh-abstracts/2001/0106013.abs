  A very simple field theory in noncommutative phase space X^{M},P^{M} in d+2
dimensions, with a gauge symmetry based on noncommutative u*(1,1), furnishes
the foundation for the field theoretic formulation of Two-Time Physics. This
leads to a remarkable unification of several gauge principles in d dimensions,
including Maxwell, Einstein and high spin gauge principles, packaged together
into one of the simplest fundamental gauge symmetries in noncommutative quantum
phase space in d+2 dimensions. A gauge invariant action is constructed and its
nonlinear equations of motion are analyzed. Besides elegantly reproducing the
first quantized worldline theory with all background fields, the field theory
prescribes unique interactions among the gauge fields. A matrix version of the
theory, with a large N limit, is also outlined
