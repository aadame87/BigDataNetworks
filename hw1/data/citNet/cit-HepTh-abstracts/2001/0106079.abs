  We calculate partition functions for supersymmetric heterotic theories on
Melvin background with Wilson line. These functions coincide with partition
functions for some of non-supersymmetric heterotic theories in appropriate
limits. This suggests that non-supersymmetric heterotic theories are equivalent
to supersymmetric theories on supersymmetry-breaking backgrounds, just as in
the case of recently conjectured IIA-0A duality.
