  It was suggested by Sugimoto that there is a new supersymmetry breaking
mechanism by an orientifold plane which is oppositely charged as the usual one.
Here we prove the trace formula for this system to show that the supersymmetry
is broken not explicitly but spontaneously. We also discuss the possibility of
interpreting the orientifold plane as an intrinsic object of the superstring
theory.
