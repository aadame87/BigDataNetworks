  variable, angle variable and quantum phase -

\\
  The relation that exists in quantum mechanics among action variables, angle
variables and the phases of quantum states is clarified, by referring to the
system of a generalized oscillator. As a by-product, quantum-mechanical meaning
of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation and related matters is clarified,
where a new picture of quantum mechanics is introduced, to be called the
Hamilton-Jacobi picture.
