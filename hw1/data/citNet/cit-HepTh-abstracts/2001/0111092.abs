  We study gauge invariant operators of open string field theory and find a
precise correspondence with on-shell closed strings. We provide a detailed
proof of the gauge invariance of the operators and a heuristic interpretation
of their correlation functions in terms of on-shell scattering amplitudes of
closed strings. We also comment on the implications of these operators to
vacuum string field theory.
