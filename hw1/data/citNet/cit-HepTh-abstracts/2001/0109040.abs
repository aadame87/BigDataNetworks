  We explore the diversity of warped metric function in five-dimensional
gravity including a scalar field and a 3-brane.
  We point out that the form of the function is determined by a parameter
introduced here.
  For a particular value of the parameter, the warped metric function is smooth
without having a singularity, and we show that the bulk cosmological constant
have a upper bound and must be positive and that the lower bound of
five-dimensional fundamental scale is controlled by both the brane tension and
four-dimensional effective Planck scale.
  The general warp factor obtained here may relate to models inspired by SUGRA
or M-theory.
