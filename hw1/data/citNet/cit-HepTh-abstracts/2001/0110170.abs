Title: Generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes
Authors: Jos\'e Figueroa-O'Farrill and Joan Sim\'on
Comments: 27 pages, 3 figures (v3: Section 2.2 completely rewritten with
  greatly improved results: in particular the classification of supersymmetric
  generalised fluxbranes is now complete. Also added one reference.)

  We classify generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes in type II string theory
obtained as Kaluza-Klein reductions of the Minkowski space vacuum of
eleven-dimensional supergravity. We obtain two families of smooth solutions
which contains all the known solutions, new solutions called nullbranes, and
solutions interpolating between them. We explicitly construct all the solutions
and we study the U-duality orbits of some of these backgrounds.
