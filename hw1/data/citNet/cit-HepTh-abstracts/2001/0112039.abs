\\
  Nonperturbative corrections in type II string theory corresponding to Riemann
surfaces with one boundary are calculated in several noncompact geometries of
desingularized orbifolds. One of these models has a complicated phase structure
which is explored. A general condition for integrality of the numerical
invariants is discussed.
