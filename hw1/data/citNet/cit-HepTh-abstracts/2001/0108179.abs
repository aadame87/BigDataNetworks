  BPS walls and junctions are studied in ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY nonlinear sigma
models in four spacetime dimensions. New BPS junction solutions connecting N
discrete vacua are found for nonlinear sigma models with several chiral scalar
superfields. A nonlinear sigma model with a single chiral scalar superfield is
also found which has a moduli space of the topology of $S^1$ and admits BPS
walls and junctions connecting arbitrary points in moduli space. SUSY condition
in nonlinear sigma models are classified either as stationary points of
superpotential or singularities of the K\"ahler metric in field space. The
total number of SUSY vacua is invariant under holomorphic field redefinitions
if we count ``runaway vacua'' also.
