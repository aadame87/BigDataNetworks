  We discuss the supergravity couplings of noncommutative D-branes by
considering the disk amplitudes with one closed string insertion. The result
confirms a recent proposal for the general form of the noncommutative
Yang-Mills operators coupling to the massless closed string modes. The
construction involves smearing Yang-Mills field variables along an open Wilson
line. For multiple D-branes interacting with background supergravity fields,
this prescription reduces, in the B=0 limit, to the ``symmetrized trace''
prescription, and the supergravity fields are seen to be functionals of the
nonabelian scalar fields on the branes.
