Title: Basis Optimization Renormalization Group for Quantum Hamiltonian
Authors: Takanori Sugihara
Journal-ref: Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 108 (2002) 267-269
\\
  We propose a renormalization group algorithm for quantum Hamiltonian to
calculate energy and wavefunctions of a small arbitrary number of low-lying
states in finite dimensional Hilbert space with high accuracy. This algorithm
is free from limitations associated with dimensionality and interaction types
of models. We also find analytic forms of renormalization group equations for
the ground state that provide convergence to the exact solution.
