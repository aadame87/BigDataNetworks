  Recent astronomical observations indicate that the universe is accelerating.
We argue that generic quintessence models that accommodate the present day
acceleration tend to accelerate eternally. As a consequence the resulting
spacetimes exhibit event horizons. Hence, quintessence poses the same problems
for string theory as asymptotic de Sitter spaces.
