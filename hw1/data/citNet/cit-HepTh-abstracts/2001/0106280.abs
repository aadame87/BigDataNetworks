  Noncommutative algebra in planar quantum mechanics is shown to follow from 't
Hooft's recent analysis on dissipation and quantization. The noncommutativity
in the coordinates or in the momenta of a charged particle in a magnetic field
with an oscillator potential are shown as dual descriptions of the same
phenomenon. Finally, noncommutativity in a fluid dynamical model, analogous to
the lowest Landau level problem, is discussed.
