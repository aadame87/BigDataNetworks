  We describe graded contractions of Virasoro algebra. The highest weight
representations of Virasoro algebra are constructed. The reducibility of
representations is analysed. In contrast to standart representations the
contracted ones are reducible except some special cases. Moreover we find an
exotic module with null-plane on fifth level.
