  We prove, for an arbitrary finite root system, the periodicity conjecture of
Al.B.Zamolodchikov concerning Y-systems, a particular class of functional
relations arising in the theory of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Algebraically,
Y-systems can be viewed as families of rational functions defined by certain
birational recurrences formulated in terms of the underlying root system. In
the course of proving periodicity, we obtain explicit formulas for all these
rational functions, which turn out to always be Laurent polynomials.
  In a closely related development, we introduce and study a family of
simplicial complexes that can be associated to arbitrary root systems. In type
A, our construction produces Stasheff's associahedron, whereas in type B, it
gives the Bott-Taubes polytope, or cyclohedron. We enumerate the faces of these
complexes, prove that their geometric realization is always a sphere, and
describe them in concrete combinatorial terms for the classical types ABCD.
