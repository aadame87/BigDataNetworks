  Variation of coupling constants of integrable system can be considered as
canonical transformation or, infinitesimally, a Hamiltonian flow in the space
of such systems. Any function $T(\vec p, \vec q)$ generates a one-parametric
family of integrable systems in vicinity of a single system: this gives an idea
of how many integrable systems there are in the space of coupling constants.
Inverse flow is generated by a dual "Hamiltonian", $\widetilde T(\vec p, \vec
q)$ associated with the dual integrable system. In vicinity of a self-dual
point the duality transformation just interchanges momenta and coordinates in
such a "Hamiltonian": $\widetilde T(\vec p, \vec q) = T(\vec q, \vec p)$. For
integrable system with several coupling constants the corresponding
"Hamiltonians" $T_i(\vec p, \vec q)$ satisfy Whitham equations and after
quantization (of the original system) become operators satisfying the
zero-curvature condition in the space of coupling constants: [ d/dg_a -
T_a(p,q), d/dg_b - T_b(p,q) ] = 0. Some explicit formulas are given for
harmonic oscillator and for Calogero-Ruijsenaars-Dell system.
