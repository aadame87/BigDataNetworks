  We reexamine the thermodynamics of adS black holes with Ricci flat horizons
using the adS soliton as the thermal background. We find that there is a phase
transition which is dependent not only on the temperature, but also on the
black hole area, which is an independent parameter. As in the spherical adS
black hole, this phase transition is related via the adS/CFT correspondence to
a confinement-deconfinement transition in the large N gauge theory on the
conformal boundary at infinity.
