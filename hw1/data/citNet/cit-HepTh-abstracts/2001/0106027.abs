  We study the identity projectors of the string field theory in the generic
BCFT background. We explain how it can be identified as the projector in the
linking algebra of the noncommutative geometry. We show that their
(regularized) trace is exactly given by the boundary entropy which is
proportional to the D-brane tension.
