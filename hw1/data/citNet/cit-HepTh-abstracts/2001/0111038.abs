Authors: Peter Schupp
Comments: 5 pages, Talk given at International Europhysics Conference on
  High-Energy Physics (HEP 2001), Budapest, Hungary, 12-18 Jul 2001

\\
  We present a brief introduction to the construction of gauge theories on
noncommutative spaces with star products. Particular emphasis is given to
issues related to non-Abelian gauge groups and charge quantization. This talk
is based on joined work with B. Jurco, J. Madore, L. Moeller, S. Schraml and J.
Wess.
