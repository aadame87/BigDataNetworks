  With our current level of understanding, the problem of making string theory
predictions is not one of "solving" the theory, but rather of trying to
determine whether there are any generic expectations. Within this context, we
discuss what it would mean to predict low energy supersymmetry, and consider
questions like: what is the form of low energy CP violation, is unification a
string prediction, and others.
