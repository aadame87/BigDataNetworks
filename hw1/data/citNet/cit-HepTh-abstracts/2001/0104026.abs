  We analyse the Seiberg Witten curve describing the N=2 gauge theory dual to
the supergravity solution with fractional branes. Emphasis is given to those
aspects that are related to stringy mechanism known as the enhancon. We also
compare our results with the features of the supergravity duals, which have
been variously interpreted in the literature. Known aspects of the N=2 gauge
theories seem to agree with the supergravity solution, whenever the two
theories can be faithfully compared.
