  We demonstrate how one can describe explicitly the present arbitrariness in
solutions of relativistic wave equations in external electromagnetic fields of
special form. This arbitrariness is connected to the existence of a
transformation, which reduces effectively the number of variables in the
initial equations. Then we use the corresponding representations to construct
new sets of exact solutions, which may have a physical interest. Namely, we
present new sets of stationary and nonstationary solutions in magnetic field
and in some superpositions of electric and magnetic fields.
