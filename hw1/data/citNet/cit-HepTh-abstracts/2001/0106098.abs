  The elementary particles are modeled as harmonic oscillator excitations of
transverse U(1) gauge fields propagating at v = c, with open and closed
string-like propagation paths. One, two and three node states represent the
leptons, bosons, and quarks. We incorporate a twist theta for the gauge field
components which rotate counterclockwise (L) for the electron, yielding a
chiral model. Theta increases by pi from node to node, making the lepton models
SU(2) representations. At nodes the twist may reverse, creating new particle
states. For three nodes, twist combinations map the SU(3) color states of the
quarks. Generations are modeled topologically by the winding number of the
strings. Mapping model E fields to distant observers makes understandable how
fractional charges arise for the quarks. These models are 3D slices of
spacetime, allowing us to make drawings of particle field conformations. From
model particle quantum numbers, new mass relationships are derived.
