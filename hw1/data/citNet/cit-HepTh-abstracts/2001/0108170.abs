  The stability of physical systems depends on the existence of a state of
least energy. In gravity, this is guaranteed by the positive energy theorem.
For topological reasons this fails for nonsupersymmetric Kaluza-Klein
compactifications, which can decay to arbitrarily negative energy. For related
reasons, this also fails for the AdS soliton, a globally static, asymptotically
toroidal $\Lambda<0$ spacetime with negative mass. Nonetheless, arguing from
the AdS/CFT correspondence, Horowitz and Myers (hep-th/9808079) proposed a new
positive energy conjecture, which asserts that the AdS soliton is the unique
state of least energy in its asymptotic class. We give a new structure theorem
for static $\Lambda<0$ spacetimes and use it to prove uniqueness of the AdS
soliton. Our results offer significant support for the new positive energy
conjecture and add to the body of rigorous results inspired by the AdS/CFT
correspondence.
