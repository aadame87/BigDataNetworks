  The interplay between string theory and cosmology is very promising. Since
string theory will yield a quantum theory of space-time and unify all forces of
nature, it has the potential of addressing many of the conceptual problems of
the current models of early Universe cosmology. In turn, cosmology is the most
obvious testing ground in the effort to construct non-perturbative string
theory, and can provide the crucial connection between theory and
experiment/observation.
