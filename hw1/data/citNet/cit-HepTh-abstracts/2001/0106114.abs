Title: Wess-Zumino term for the AdS superstring and generalized Inonu-Wigner
  contraction

  We examine a Wess-Zumino term, written in bilinear of superinvariant
currents, for a superstring in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The standard
Inonu-Wigner contraction does not give the correct flat limit but gives zero.
This originates from the fact that the fermionic metric of the super-Poincare
group is degenerate. We propose a generalization of the Inonu-Wigner
contraction which reduces the super-AdS group to the "nondegenerate"
super-Poincare group, therefore it gives a correct flat limit of this
Wess-Zumino term. We also discuss the M-algebra obtained by this generalized
Inonu-Wigner contraction from osp(1|32).
