  We present the explicit form of the four-dimensional effective supergravity
action which describes low-energy physics of the Randall--Sundrum model with
moduli fields in the bulk and charged chiral matter living on the branes. The
low-energy action is derived from the compactification of a locally
supersymmetric model in five dimension. We describe the mechanism of
supersymmetry breaking mediation which relies on the non-trivial configuration
of the $Z_2$-odd bulk fields. Broken supersymmetry leads to stabilization of
the interbrane distance.
