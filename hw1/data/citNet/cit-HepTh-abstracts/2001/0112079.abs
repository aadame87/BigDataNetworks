  We continue our study of codimension two solutions of warped space-time
varying compactifications of string theory. In this letter we discuss a
non-supersymmetric solution of the classical type IIB string theory with de
Sitter gravity on a codimension two uncompactified part of spacetime. A
non-zero positive value of the cosmological constant is induced by the presence
of non-trivial stringy moduli, such as the axion-dilaton system for the type
IIB string theory. Furthermore, the naked singularity of the codimension two
solution is resolved by the presence of a small but non-zero cosmological
constant.
