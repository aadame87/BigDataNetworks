Title: D-branes in some near-horizon geometries
Author: C. Bachas (ENS, Paris)
Comments: 11 pages, Latex, 2 eps figures, uses JHEP.cls

  I review some properties of D-branes in the SU(2) and SL(2,R) WZW models. I
comment on a potential difficulty for the realization of `warped brane worlds'
in string theory. This short note is based on a talk given at the Strings'01
conference in Mumbay.
