  It was shown by Weyl that the general static axisymmetric solution of the
vacuum Einstein equations in four dimensions is given in terms of a single
axisymmetric solution of the Laplace equation in three-dimensional flat space.
Weyl's construction is generalized here to arbitrary dimension $D\ge 4$. The
general solution of the D-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations that admits D-2
orthogonal commuting non-null Killing vector fields is given either in terms of
D-3 independent axisymmetric solutions of Laplace's equation in
three-dimensional flat space or by D-4 independent solutions of Laplace's
equation in two-dimensional flat space. Explicit examples of new solutions are
given. These include a five-dimensional asymptotically flat ``black ring'' with
an event horizon of topology S^1 x S^2 held in equilibrium by a conical
singularity in the form of a disc.
