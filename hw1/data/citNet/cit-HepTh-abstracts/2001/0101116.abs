  SW(3/2,2) superconformal algebra is W algebra with two Virasoro operators.
The Kac determinant is calculated and the complete list of unitary
representations is determined. Two types of extensions of SW(3/2,2) algebra are
discussed. A new approach to construction of W algebras from rational conformal
field theories is proposed.
