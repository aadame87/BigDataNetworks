  The ultra-violet behavior of Kaluza-Klein theories on a one dimensional
orbifold is discussed. An extension of dimensional regularization that can be
applied to a compact dimension is presented. Using this, the FI-tadpole is
calculated in the effective KK theory resulting from compactifying
supersymmetric theories in 5 dimensions.
