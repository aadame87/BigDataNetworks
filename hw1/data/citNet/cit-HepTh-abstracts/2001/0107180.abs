  Two dimensional Non-Commutative Open String (NCOS) theory, well-defined
perturbatively, may also be studied at strong coupling and for large D-string
charge by making use of the Holographic duality. We analyze the zero mode
dynamics of a closed string in the appropriate background geometry and map the
results onto a sector of strongly coupled NCOS dynamics. We find an elaborate
classical picture that shares qualitative similarities with the SL(2,R) WZW
model. In the quantum problem, we compute propagators and part of the energy
spectrum of the theory; the latter involves interesting variations in the
density of states as a function of the level number, and energies scaling
inversely with the coupling. Finally, the geometry exhibits a near horizon
throat, associated with NCOS dynamics, yet it is found that the whole space is
available for Holography. This provides a setting to extend the Maldacena
duality beyond the near horizon limit.
