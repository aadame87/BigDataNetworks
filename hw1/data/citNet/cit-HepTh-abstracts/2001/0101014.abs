  We test the validity of the Siegel gauge condition for the lump solution of
cubic open bosonic string field theory by checking the equations of motion of
the string field components outside the Siegel gauge. At level (3,6)
approximation, the linear and quadratic terms of the equations of motion of
these fields are found to cancel within about 20%.
