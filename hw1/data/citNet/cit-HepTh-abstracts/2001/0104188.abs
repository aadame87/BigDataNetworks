  We study the renormalizability of (massive) topological QCD based on the
algebraic BRST technique by adopting a non-covariant Landau type gauge and
making use of the full topological superalgebra. The most general local counter
terms are determined and it is shown that in the presence of central charges
the BRST cohomology remains trivial. By imposing an additional set of stability
constraints it is proven that the matter action of topological QCD is
perturbatively finite.
