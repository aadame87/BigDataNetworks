Title: Non-Abelian Structures in BSFT and RR couplings
Authors: Emil T.Akhmedov (ITEP,Moscow)
Comments: Latex, 13pp., Minor correction (references added); This is the
  extended version of the talk presented at 10th Tohwa International Symposium
  on String theory which was held in Fukuoka, July 2001
Report-no: ITEP-TH-53/01
\\
  In this talk we show that the tachyon annihilation combined with an
approximation, in which string theory non-commutativity structure is captured
by the algebra of differential operators on space-time, gives a unified point
of view on: non-Abelian structures on $D$-branes; all lowest energy excitations
on $D$-branes; all RR couplings in type II string theory.
