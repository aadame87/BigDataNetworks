  We study some properties of the tachyonic lumps in the level truncation
scheme of bosonic cubic string field theory. We find that several gauges work
well and that the size of the lump as well as its tension is approximately
independent of these gauge choices at level (2,4). We also examine the
fluctuation spectrum around the lump solution, and find that a tachyon with
m^2=-0.96 and some massive scalars appear on the lump world-volume. This result
strongly supports the conjecture that a codimension 1 lump solution is
identified with a D-brane of one lower dimension within the framework of
bosonic cubic string field theory.
