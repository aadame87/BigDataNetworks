  Using the Baxter's T-Q relation derived from the transfer matrix technique,
we consider the diagonalization problem of discrete quantum pendulum and
discrete quantum sine-Gordon Hamiltonian from the algebraic geometry aspect.
For a finite chain system of the size L, when the spectral curve degenerates
into rational curves, we have reduced Baxter's T-Q relation into a polynomial
equation; the connection of T-Q polynomial equation with the algebraic Bethe
Ansatz is clearly established . In particular, for L=4 it is the case of
rational spectral curves for the discrete quantum pendulum and discrete
sine-Gordon model. To these Baxter's T-Q polynomial equations, we have obtained
the complete and explicit solutions with a detailed understanding of their
quantitative and qualitative structure. In general the model possesses a
spectral curve with a generic parameter. We have conducted certain qualitative
study on the algebraic geometry of this high-genus Riemann surface
incorporating Baxter's T-Q relation.
