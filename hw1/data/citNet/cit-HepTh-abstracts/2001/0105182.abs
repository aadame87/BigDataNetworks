  We construct a broad family of exact solutions to the five-dimensional
Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field with an exponential potential.
Embedding a three-brane in these bulk space-times in a particular way we obtain
a class of self-tuned curved brane worlds in which the vacuum energy on the
brane is gravitationally idle, the four-dimensional geometry being insensitive
to the value of the brane tension. This self-tuning arises from cancellations,
enforced by the junction conditions, between the scalar field potential, the
brane vacuum energy and the matter on the brane. Finally, we study some
physically relevant examples and their dynamics.
