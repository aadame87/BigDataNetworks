  Domain wall solutions have attracted much attention due to their relevance
for brane world scenarios and the holographic RG flow. In this talk I discuss
the following aspects for these applications: (i) derivation of the first order
flow equations as Bogomol'nyi bound; (ii) different types of critical points of
the superpotential; (iii) the superpotential needed to localize gravity; (iv)
the constraints imposed by supersymmetry including an example for an $N$=1 flow
and finally (v) sources and exponential trapping of gravity.
