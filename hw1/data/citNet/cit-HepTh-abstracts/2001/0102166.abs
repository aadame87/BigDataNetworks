  The (m^2,\Lambda) plane of spin s>1 massive fields in (A)dS backgrounds is
shown to consist of separate phases, divided by lines of novel ``partially
massless'' gauge theories that successively remove helicities, starting from
the lowest, 0 or +/-(1/2). The norms of the excluded states flip as the gauge
lines are crossed and only the region containing the massive Minkowski theory
is unitary. The partially massless gauge theories are unitary or not, depending
on the ordering of the gauge lines. This ``level splitting'' of massless
Minkowski gauge theories is specific to non-zero \Lambda.
