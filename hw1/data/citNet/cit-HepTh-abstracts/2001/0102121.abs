  We consider the long range forces between two BPS particles on the Coulomb
branch of N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories. The 1/r potential is
unambiguously fixed, even at strong coupling, by the moduli dependence of
central charges supported by the BPS states. The effective Coulombic coupling
vanishes on marginal stability curves, while sign changes on crossing these
curves explain the restructuring of the spectrum of composite BPS states. This
restructuring proceeds via the delocalization of the composite state on
approach to the curve of marginal stability. Therefore the spectrum of BPS
states can be inferred by analyzing the submanifolds of the moduli space where
the long range potential is attractive. This method also allows us to find
certain non-BPS bound states and their stability domains. As examples, we
consider the dissociation of the W boson and higher charge dyons at strong
coupling in N=2 SU(2) SYM, quark-monopole bound states in N=2 SYM with one
flavor, and composite dyons in N=2 SU(3) SYM.
