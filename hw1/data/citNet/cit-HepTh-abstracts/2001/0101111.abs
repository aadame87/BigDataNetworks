  A kind of Dirac-Connes operator defined in the framework of Connes' NCG is
introduced on discrete abelian groups; it satisfies a Junk-free condition, and
bridges the NCG composed by Dimakis, M\"{u}ller-Hoissen and Sitarz and the NCG
of Connes. Then we apply this operator to d-dimensional lattices.
