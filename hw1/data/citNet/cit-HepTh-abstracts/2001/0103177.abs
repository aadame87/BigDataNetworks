  We establish T-duality between NS5 branes stuck on an orientifold 8-plane in
type I' and an orientifold construction in type IIB with D7 branes intersecting
at angles. Two applications are discussed. For one we obtain new brane
constructions, realizing field theories with gauge group a product of
symplectic factors, giving rise to a large new class of conformal N=1 theories
embedded in string theory. Second, by studying a D2 brane probe in the type I'
background, we get some information on the still elusive (0,4) linear sigma
model describing a perturbative heterotic string on an ADE singularity.
