  We propose a renormalization group scaling function which is constructed from
q-deformed fermionic versions of Virasoro characters. By comparison with
alternative methods, which take their starting point in the massive theories,
we demonstrate that these new functions contain qualitatively the same
information. We show that these functions allow for RG-flows not only amongst
members of a particular series of conformal field theories, but also between
different series such as N=0,1,2 supersymmetric conformal field theories. We
provide a detailed analysis of how Weyl characters may be utilized in order to
solve various recurrence relations emerging at the fixed points of these flows.
The q-deformed Virasoro characters allow furthermore for the construction of
particle spectra, which involve unstable pseudo-particles.
