  Trying to interpret recent matrix model results (hep-th/0101011) we discuss
computation of classical free energy of exact dilatonic 2-d black hole from the
effective action of string theory. The euclidean space-time action evaluated on
the black hole background is divergent due to linear dilaton vacuum
contribution, and its finite part depends on a subtraction procedure. The
thermodynamic approach based on subtracting the vacuum contribution for fixed
values of temperature and dilaton charge at the "wall" gives (as in the
leading-order black hole case) S= M/T for the entropy and zero value for the
free energy F. We suggest that in order to establish a correspondence with a
non-vanishing matrix model result for F one may need an alternative
reparametrization-invariant subtraction procedure using analogy with
non-critical string theory (i.e. replacing the spatial coordinate by the
dilaton field). The subtraction of the dilaton divergence then produces a
finite value for the free energy. We also propose a microscopic estimate for
the entropy and energy of the black hole based on the contribution of
non-singlet states of the matrix model.
