  We discuss some physical issues related to the K-theoretic classification of
D-brane charges, putting an emphasis on the role of D-brane instantons. The
relation to D-instantons provides a physical interpretation to the mathematical
algorithm for computing K-theory known as the ``Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral
sequence.'' Conjecturally, a formulation in terms of D-instantons leads to a
computationally useful formulation of K-homology in general. As an application
and illustration of this viewpoint we discuss some issues connected with
D-brane charges associated with branes in WZW models. We discuss the case of
SU(3) in detail, and comment on the general picture of branes in SU(N), based
on a recent result of M. Hopkins.
