Title: Quantum Properties of Solitons in $U(\phi)=\phi^2\ln^2(\phi^2)$ and
  $U(\phi)=\phi^2\cos^2(\phi^2)$ Models

  Recently we constructed two new $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar field theory
models that posses solitonic solutions. They are the
$U(\phi)=\phi^2\ln^2(\phi^2)$ and the $U(\phi)=\phi^2\cos^2(\phi^2)$ models .
The first quantum corrections for these models are given by exactly solvable
Schrodinger equations. In this paper we first examine the quantum meaning of
the solitonic solutions and study the scattering of the mesons by the quantum
soliton at order $\hbar$. Finally we give a finite expression for the soliton
masses of both models and evaluate such expression approximately in the case of
the second model.
