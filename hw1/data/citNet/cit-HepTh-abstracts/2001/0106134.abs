  the linear and the quadratic terms is stated

  We deform gravity with higher curvature terms in four dimensions and argue
that the non-relativistic limit is of the same form as the non-relativistic
limit of the theories with large extra dimensions. Therefore the experiments
that perform sub-millimeter tests of inverse-square law cannot distinguish the
effects of large extra dimensions from the effects of higher dimensional
operators. In other words instead of detecting the presence of sub-millimeter
dimensions; the experiments could be detecting the existence of massive modes
of gravity with large masses ($\ge 10^{-3}$ eV)
