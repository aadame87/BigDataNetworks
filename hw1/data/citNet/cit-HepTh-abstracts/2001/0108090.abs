  The 1+1 dimensional massive Dirac equation is solved exactly in light-cone
coordinates for $x^+ > 0$ and $x^- > -L$, in the presence of an arbitrary $x^+$
dependent electric field. Our solution resolves the ambiguity at $p^+ = 0$. We
also obtain the one loop rate for pair production for a positive electric
field, compute the expectation values of the vector and axial vector currents,
and recover the well known anomaly $e^2 E/\pi$ in the divergence of the latter.
A final intriguing result is that the theory seems to exhibit a phase
transition in the limit of infinite $L$.
