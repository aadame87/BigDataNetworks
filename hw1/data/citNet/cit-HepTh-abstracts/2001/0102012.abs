  Reminiscences on the String origins of Supersymmetry are followed by a
discussion of the importance of confusing bosons with fermions in building
superstring theories in 9+1 dimensions. In eleven dimensions, the kinship
between bosons and fermions is more subtle, and may involve the exceptional
group $F_4$.
