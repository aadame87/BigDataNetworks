  We discuss the $\phi^4$ and $\phi^6$ theory defined in a flat $D$-dimensional
space-time. We assume that the system is in equilibrium with a thermal bath at
temperature $\beta^{-1}$. To obtain non-perturbative result, the $ 1/N $
expansion is used. The method of the composite operator (CJT) for summing a
large set of Feynman graphs, is developed for the finite temperature system.
The ressumed effective potential and the analysis of the D=3 and D=4 cases are
given.
