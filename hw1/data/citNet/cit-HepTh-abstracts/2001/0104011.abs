  In our previous work (Phys. Rev. D63, 085010, hep-th/0011290), we showed that
the brane universe on the giant graviton moving in the near-horizon background
of the dilatonic D(6-p)-brane is described by the mirage cosmology. We study
thermodynamic properties of the moving giant graviton by applying
thermodynamics of cosmology and the recently proposed holographic principles of
cosmology. We find that the Fischler-Susskind holographic bound is satisfied by
the closed brane universe on the moving giant graviton with p>3. The Bekenstein
and the Hubble entropy bounds and the recently proposed Verlinde's holographic
principle applied to the brane universe on the giant graviton are also studied.
