  We study the dynamics of an open membrane with a cylindrical topology, in the
background of a constant three form. We use the action, due to Bergshoeff,
London and Townsend, to study the noncommutativity properties of the boundary
string coordinates. The constrained Hamiltonian formalism due to Dirac is used
to derive the noncommutativity of coordinates. The chain of constraints is
found to be finite for a suitable gauge choice.
