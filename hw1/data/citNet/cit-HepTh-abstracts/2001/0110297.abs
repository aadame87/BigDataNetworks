Title: Symplectic Quantization of Open Strings and Noncommutativity in Branes
Authors: Nelson R. F. Braga and Cresus F. L. Godinho
Comments: We included a comparison with previous results obtained from Dirac
  quantization, emphasizing the fact that in the symplectic case the boundary
  conditions, that lead to the non commutativity, show up from the direct
  application of the standard method. Version to appear in Phys. Rev. D

  We show how to translate boundary conditions into constraints in the
symplectic quantization method by an appropriate choice of generalized
variables. This way the symplectic quantization of an open string attached to a
brane in the presence of an antisymmetric background field reproduces the non
commutativity of the brane coordinates.
