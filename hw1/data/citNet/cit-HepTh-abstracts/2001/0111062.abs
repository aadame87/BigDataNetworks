  Using the ${\cal N}=2$ superfield approach, we construct full ${\cal N}=4$
supersymmetric low-energy effective actions for ${\cal N}=4$ SYM models, with
both ${\cal N}=2$ gauge superfield strengths and hypermultiplet superfields
included. The basic idea is to complete the known non-holomorphic effective
potentials which depend only on ${\cal N}=2$ superfield strengths $W$ and
${\bar W}$ to the full on-shell ${\cal N}=4$ invariants by adding the
appropriate superfield hypermultiplet terms. We prove that the effective
potentials of the form ${ln} W {ln} \bar W$ can be ${\cal N} = 4$ completed in
this way and present the precise structure of the corresponding completions.
However, the effective potentials of the non-logarithmic form suggested in
hep-th/9811017 and hep-th/9909020 do not admit the ${\cal N}=4$ completion.
Therefore, such potentials cannot come out as (perturbative or
non-perturbative) quantum corrections in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM models.
