  We present here a cohomological analysis of the new spacetime superalgebras
that arise in the context of superbrane theory. They lead to enlarged
superspaces that allow us to write D-brane actions in terms of fields
associated with the additional superspace variables. This suggests that there
is an extended superspace/worldvolume fields democracy for superbranes.
