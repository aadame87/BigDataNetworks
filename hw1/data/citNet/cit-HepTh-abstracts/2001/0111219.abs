  Black p-brane solutions for a wide class of intersection rules and Ricci-flat
``internal'' spaces are considered. They are defined up to moduli functions H_s
obeying non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditions
imposed. A new solution with intersections corresponding to the Lie algebra C_2
is obtained. The functions H_1 and H_2 for this solution are polynomials of
degree 3 and 4.
