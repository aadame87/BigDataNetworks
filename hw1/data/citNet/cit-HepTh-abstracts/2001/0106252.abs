  Using a Kaluza-Klein framework, we consider a relativistic fluid whose
projection yields the supersymmetric non-relativistic Chaplygin gas introduced
by Bergner-Jackiw-Polychronakos and by Hoppe. The conserved (super)charges of
the Chaplygin gas are obtained as the projection of those arising in the
extended model.
