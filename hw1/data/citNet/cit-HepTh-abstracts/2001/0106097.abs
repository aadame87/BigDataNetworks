  Randall-Sundrum cosmologies

  effective 4d cosmological constant is changed. References are added

  We describe a novel dynamical mechanism to radiate away a positive four
dimensional cosmological constant, in the Randall-Sundrum cosmological
scenario. We show that there are modes of the bulk gravitational field for
which the brane is effectively a mirror. This will generally give rise to an
emission of thermal radiation from the brane into the bulk. The temperature
turns out to be nonvanishing only if the effective four dimensional
cosmological constant is positive. In any theory where the four dimensional
vacuum energy is a function of physical degrees of freedom, there is then a
mechanism that radiates away any positive four dimensional cosmological
constant.
