  We calculate the tension of the D3-brane in the fivebrane background which is
described by the exactly solvable SU(2)_k x U(1) world-sheet conformal field
theory with large Kac-Moody level k. The D3-brane tension is extracted from the
amplitude of one closed string exchange between two parallel D3-branes, and the
amplitude is calculated by utilizing the open-closed string duality. The
tension of the D3-brane in the background does not coincide with the one in the
flat space-time even in the flat space-time limit: k -> infinity. The finite
curvature effect should vanish in the flat space-time limit and only the
topological effect can remain. Therefore, the deviation indicates the
condensation of gravitino and/or dilatino which has been expected in the
fivebrane background as a gravitational instanton.
