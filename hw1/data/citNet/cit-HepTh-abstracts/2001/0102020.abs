\\
  String/Field theory correspondences have been discussed heavily in recent
years. Here, we describe a testing scenario involving a non-perturbative field
theory calculation using the framework of supersymmetric discrete light-cone
quantization (SDLCQ). We consider a Maldacena-type conjecture applied to the
near horizon geometry of a D1-brane in the supergravity approximation.
Numerical results of a test of this conjecture are presented with orders of
magnitude more states than we previously considered. These results support the
Maldacena conjecture and are within 10-15% of the predicted results. We present
a method for using a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the Fock
basis and discuss a numerical method that we use which is particularly well
suited for this type of matrix element calculation. Our results are still not
sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot be considered to
be a numerical proof of the conjecture. We update our continuous efforts to
improve on these results and present some results on the way to higher
dimensional scenarios.
