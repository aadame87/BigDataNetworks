  In an earlier work extensions of supersymmetry and super Lie algebras were
constructed consistently starting from any representation $\D$ of any Lie
algebra $\g$. Here it is shown how infinite dimensional Lie algebras appear
naturally within the framework of fractional supersymmetry. Using a
differential realization of $\g$ this infinite dimensional Lie algebra,
containing the Lie algebra $\g$ as a sub-algebra, is explicitly constructed.
