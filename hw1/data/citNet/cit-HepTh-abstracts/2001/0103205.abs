  We consider a class of models with infinite extra dimension, where bulk space
does not possess SO(1,3) invariance, but Lorentz invariance emerges as an
approximate symmetry of the low-energy effective theory. In these models, the
maximum attainable speeds of the graviton, gauge bosons and scalar particles
are automatically equal to each other and smaller than the maximum speed in the
bulk. Additional fine-tuning is needed in order to assure that the maximum
attainable speed of fermions takes the same value. A peculiar feature of our
scenario is that there are no truly localized modes. All four-dimensional
particles are resonances with finite widths. The latter depends on the energy
of the particle and is naturally small at low energies.
