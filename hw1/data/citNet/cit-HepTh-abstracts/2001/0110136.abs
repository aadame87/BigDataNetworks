  Starting from the boundary CFT definition for the D-branes in vacuum string
field theory (VSFT) given in hep-th/0105168, we derive the oscillator
expression for the D24-brane solution in the VSFT on D25-brane. We show that
the state takes the form of a squeezed state, similar to the one found directly
in terms of the oscillators and reported in hep-th/0102112. Both the solutions
are actually one parameter families of solutions. We also find numerical
evidence that at least for moderately large values of the parameter $(b)$ in
the oscillator construction the two families of solutions are same under a
suitable redefinition of the parameter. Finally we generalize the method to
computing the oscillator expression for a D-brane solution with constant gauge
field strength turned on along the world volume.
