  A careful ab initio construction of the finite-mass (1/2,1/2) representation
space of the Lorentz group reveals it to be a spin-parity multiplet. In
general, it does not lend itself to a single-spin interpretation. We find that
the (1/2,1/2) representation space for massive particles naturally bifurcates
into a triplet and a singlet of opposite relative intrinsic parties. The
text-book separation into spin one and spin zero states occurs only for certain
limited kinematical settings. We construct a wave equation for the (1/2,1/2)
multiplet, and show that the particles and antiparticles in this representation
space do not carry a definite spin but only a definite relative intrinsic
parity. In general, both spin one and spin zero are covariantly inseparable
inhabitants of massive vector fields. This last observation suggests that
scalar particles, such as the Higgs, are natural inhabitants of massive
(1/2,1/2) representation space.
