  The unitarity equations for the boson interaction amplitudes in the
superstring theory are used to calculate the interaction amplitudes including
the Ramond states, which are 10-fermion and Ramond bosons. The n-loop, 4-point
amplitude with two massless Neveu-Schwarz bosons and two massless Ramond states
is obtained explicitly. It is shown that, in addition, the unitarity equations
require some integral relations for local functions determining the amplitude.
For the tree amplitude the validness of the above integral relations is
verified.
