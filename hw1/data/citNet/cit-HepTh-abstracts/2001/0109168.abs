  We present a (unique?) possibility of de Sitter solution in the framework of
N=2 supersymmetry (hypersymmetry). We show that a model with a vector and a
charged hypermultiplet has a hybrid inflation type potential. It leads to a
slow-roll regime in de Sitter type background with all supersymmetries broken
spontaneously. Beyond the bifurcation point the waterfall stage abruptly brings
the system into a ground state with 2 unbroken supersymmetries. De Sitter stage
exists under condition that the superconformal SU(2,2|2) symmetry of the model
is softly broken down to N=2 supersymmetry by the vev of the Killing
prepotential triplet P^r. This hybrid hypersymmetry model may describe P-term
inflation and/or acceleration of the universe at the present epoch.
