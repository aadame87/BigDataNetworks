Title: Supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the variational method and a new shape
  invariant potential
Authors: Elso Drigo filho and Regina Maria Ricotta
Comments: Talk given at the XXIII International Colloquium on Group Theoretical
  Methods in Physics, Dubna, August 2000, 10 pages
\\
  The association of the variational method with supersymmetric quantum
mechanics through an ansatz for the superpotential is reviewed and the
approximate energy spectra of non-exactly solvable potentials, such like the
Hulthen, the Morse and the screened Coulomb potentials, in 3 dimensions, are
presented. A sketch of a new exactly shape invariant potential is also
presented.
