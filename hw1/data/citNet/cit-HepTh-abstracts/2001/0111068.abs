  We establish a correspondence between toroidal compactifications of M-theory
and del Pezzo surfaces. M-theory on T^k corresponds to P^2 blown up at k
generic points; Type IIB corresponds to P^1\times P^1. The moduli of
compactifications of M-theory on rectangular tori are mapped to Kahler moduli
of del Pezzo surfaces.The U-duality group of M-theory corresponds to a group of
classical symmetries of the del Pezzo represented by global diffeomorphisms.
The half-BPS brane charges of M-theory correspond to spheres in the del Pezzo,
and their tension to the exponentiated volume of the corresponding spheres. The
electric/magnetic pairing of branes is determined by the condition that the
union of the corresponding spheres represent the anticanonical class of the del
Pezzo. The condition that a pair of half-BPS states form a bound state is
mapped to a condition on the intersection of the corresponding spheres. We
present some speculations about the meaning of this duality.
