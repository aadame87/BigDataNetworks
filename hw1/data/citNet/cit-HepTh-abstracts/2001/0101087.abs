  We construct an exact soliton, which represents a BPS Dp-brane, in a boundary
string field theory action of infinitely many non-BPS D(p-1)-branes.
Furthermore, we show that this soliton can be regarded as an exact soliton in
the full string field theory. The world-volume theory of the BPS Dp-brane
constructed in this way becomes usual gauge theory on commutative R^{p+1},
instead of non-commutative plane. We also construct a D$p$-brane from non-BPS
D(p-n)-branes by the ABS like configuration. We confirm that the Dp-brane has
correct RR charges and the tension.
