  In the usual and current understanding of planar gauge choices for Abelian
and non Abelian gauge fields, the external defining vector $n_\mu$ can either
be space-like ($n^2<0$) or time-like ($n^2>0$) but not light-like ($n^2=0$). In
this work we propose a light-like planar gauge that consists in defining a
modified gauge-fixing term, $\cal{L}_{GF}$, whose main characteristic is a
two-degree violation of Lorentz covariance arising from the fact that
four-dimensional space-time spanned entirely by null vectors as basis
necessitates two light-like vectors, namely $n_\mu$ and its dual $m_\mu$, with
$n^2=m^2=0, n\cdot m\neq 0$, say, e.g. normalized to $n\cdot m=2$.
