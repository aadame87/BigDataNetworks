  We propose explicit expressions for the form factors, including their
normalization constants, of topologically charged (or soliton-creating)
operators in the sine-Gordon model. The normalization constants, which
constitute the main content of our proposal, allow one to find exact relations
between the short- and long-distance asymptotics of the correlation functions.
We make predictions concerning asymptotics of fermion correlation functions in
the massive Thirring model, SU(2)-Thirring model with anisotropy, and in the
half-filled Hubbard chain.
