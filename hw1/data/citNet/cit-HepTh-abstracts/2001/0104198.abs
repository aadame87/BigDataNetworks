  A uniformly acclerated observer in anti-deSitter space-time is known to
detect thermal radiation when the acceleration exceeds a critical value. We
investigate the holographic interpretation of this phenomenon. For uniformly
accelerated trajectories transverse to the boundary of the AdS space, the
hologram is a blob which expands along the boundary. Observers on the boundary
co-moving with the hologram become observers in cosmological space-times. For
supercritical accelerations one gets a Milne universe when the holographic
screen is the boundary in Poincare coordinates, while for the boundary in
hyperspherical coordinates one gets deSitter spacetimes. The presence or
absence of thermality is then interpreted in terms of specific classes of
observers in these cosmologies.
