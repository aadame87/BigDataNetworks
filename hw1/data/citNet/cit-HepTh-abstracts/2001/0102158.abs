  We discuss non-commutative field theories in coordinate space. To do so we
introduce pseudo-localized operators that represent interesting position
dependent (gauge invariant) observables. The formalism may be applied to
arbitrary field theories, with or without supersymmetry.
  The formalism has a number of intuitive advantages. First it makes clear the
appearance of new degrees of freedom in the infrared. Second, it allows for a
study of correlation functions of (composite) operators. Thus we calculate the
two point function in position space of the insertion of certain composite
operators. We demonstrate that, even at tree level, many of the by now familiar
properties of non-commutative field theories are manifest and have simple
interpretations. The form of correlation functions are such that certain
singularities may be interpreted in terms of dimensional reduction along the
non-commutative directions: this comes about because these are theories of
fundamental dipoles.
