  Kaluza-Klein theory in which the geometry of an additional dimension is
fractal has been considered. In such a theory the mass of an elementary
electric charge appears to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck
mass, and the "tower" of masses which correspond to higher integer charges
becomes aperiodic.
