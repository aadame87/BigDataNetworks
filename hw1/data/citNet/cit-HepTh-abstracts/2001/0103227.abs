Title: Absorption of TeV Photons and $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} algebra
Authors: G. Amelino-Camelia (Univ. Roma ``La Sapienza'', and INFN, Roma), J.

  University, Zielona Gora)
Comments: LaTeX, 9 pages. Amelino-Camelia joined the collaboration. We improved
  the analysis in many ways; in particular, we now find full agreement witha
  previous study, by Amelino-Camelia and Piran, of threshold
  particle-production. We also present an analysis of processes above
  threshold, obtaining results that could provide an explanation for puzzling
  observations of multi-TeV photons Markarian501

  We consider the process of collision between a hard photon and a soft photon
producing an electron-positron pair, under the assumption that the kinematics
be described according to the $\kappa$-deformation of the D=4 Poincar\'{e}
algebra. We emphasize the relevance of this analysis for the understanding of
the puzzling observations of multi-TeV photons from Markarian 501. We find a
significant effect of the $\kappa$-deformation for processes above threshold,
while, in agreement with a previous study, we find that there is no
leading-order deformation of the threshold condition.
