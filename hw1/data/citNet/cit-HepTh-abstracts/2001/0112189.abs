  We describe a class of exact solutions of super Yang-Mills theory on
even-dimensional noncommutative tori. These solutions generalize the solitons
on a noncommutative plane introduced in hep-th/0009142 that are conjectured to
describe unstable D2p-D0 systems. We show that the spectrum of quadratic
fluctuations around our solutions correctly reproduces the string spectrum of
the D2p-D0 system in the Seiberg-Witten decoupling limit. In particular the
fluctuations correctly reproduce the 0-0 string winding modes. For p=1 and p=2
we match the differences between the soliton energy and the energy of an
appropriate SYM BPS state with the binding energies of D2-D0 and D4-D0 systems.
We also give an example of a soliton that we conjecture describes branes of
intermediate dimension on a torus such as a D2-D4 system on a four-torus.
