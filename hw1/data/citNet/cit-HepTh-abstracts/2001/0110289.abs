  It is often convenient to view Hawking (black hole) radiation as a process of
quantum tunneling. Within this framework, Kraus and Wilczek (KW) have initiated
an analytical treatment of black hole emission. Notably, their methodology
incorporates the effects of a dynamical black hole geometry. In the current
paper, the KW formalism is applied to the case of a charged BTZ black hole. In
the context of this interesting model, we are able to demonstrate a non-thermal
spectrum, with the usual Hawking result being reproduced at zeroth order in
frequency. Considerable attention is then given to the examination of
near-extremal thermodynamics.
