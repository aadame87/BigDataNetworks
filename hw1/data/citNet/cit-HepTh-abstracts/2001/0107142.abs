  We study the motion of a D(8-p)-brane probe in the background created by a
stack of non-threshold (D(p-2), Dp) bound states for $2\le p\le 6$. The brane
probe and the branes of the background have two common directions. We show that
for a particular value of the worldvolume gauge field there exist
configurations of the probe brane which behave as massless particles and can be
interpreted as gravitons blown up into a fuzzy sphere and a noncommutative
plane. We check this behaviour by studying the motion and energy of the brane
and by determining how supersymmetry is broken by the probe as it moves under
the action of the background.
