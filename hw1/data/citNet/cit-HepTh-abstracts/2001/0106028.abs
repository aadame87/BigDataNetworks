  In this paper we study spatially quenched, SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in the
large-N limit. The resulting reduced action shows the same formal look as the
Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind M-theory action. The Weyl-Wigner-Moyal symbol
of this matrix model is the Moyal deformation of a p(=2)-brane action. Thus,
the large-N limit of the spatially quenched SU(N) Yang-Mills is seen to
describe a dynamical membrane. By assuming spherical symmetry we compute the
mass spectrum of this object in the WKB approximation.
