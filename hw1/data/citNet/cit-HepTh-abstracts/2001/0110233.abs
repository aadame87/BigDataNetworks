\\
  Various forms of derivative dispersion relations, in which the dispersion
integral is replaced by a series of derivatives of the imaginary part of a
scattering amplitude, are reviewed. Conditions of their validity and practical
applicability as well as their relevance to high-energy small-angle
hadron-hadron scattering are discussed.
