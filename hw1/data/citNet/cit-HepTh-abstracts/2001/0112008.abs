  We discuss the partners of the stress energy tensor and their structure in
Logarithmic conformal field theories. In particular we draw attention to the
fundamental differences between theories with zero and non-zero central charge.
However they are both characterised by at least two independent parameters. We
show how, by using a generalised Sugawara construction, one can calculate the
logarithmic partner of T. We show that such a construction works in the c=-2
theory using the conformal dimension one primary currents which generate a
logarithmic extension of the Kac-Moody algebra.
