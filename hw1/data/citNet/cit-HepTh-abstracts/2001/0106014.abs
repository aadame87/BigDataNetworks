  We consider configurations of D7-branes and whole and fractional D3-branes
with N=2 supersymmetry. On the supergravity side these have a warp factor,
three-form flux and a nonconstant dilaton. We discuss general IIB solutions of
this type and then obtain the specific solutions for the D7/D3 system. On the
gauge side the D7-branes add matter in the fundamental representation of the
D3-brane gauge theory. We find that the gauge and supergravity metrics on
moduli space agree. However, in many cases the supergravity curvature is large
even when the gauge theory is strongly coupled. In these cases we argue that
the useful supergravity dual must be a IIA configuration.
