  We briefly review the results of our paper hep-th/0009013: we study certain
perturbative solutions of left-unilateral matrix equations. These are algebraic
equations where the coefficients and the unknown are square matrices of the
same order, or, more abstractly, elements of an associative, but possibly
noncommutative algebra, and all coefficients are on the left. Recently such
equations have appeared in a discussion of generalized Born-Infeld theories. In
particular, two equations, their perturbative solutions and the relation
between them are studied, applying a unified approach based on the generalized
Bezout theorem for matrix polynomials.
