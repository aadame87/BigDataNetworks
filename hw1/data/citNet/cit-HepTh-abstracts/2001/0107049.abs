  We consider the two-dimensional "Schwarzschild" and "Reissner-Nordstrom"
stringy black holes as systems of Casimir type. We explicitly calculate the
energy-momentum tensor of a massless scalar field satisfying Dirichlet boundary
conditions on two one-dimensional "walls". These results are obtained using the
Wald's axioms. Thermodynamical quantities such as pressure, specific heat,
isothermal compressibility and entropy of the two-dimensional stringy black
holes are calculated. A comparison is made between the obtained results and the
laws of thermodynamics. The results obtained for the extremal (Q=M) stringy
two-dimensional charged black hole are identical in all three different vacua
used; a fact that indicates its quantum stability.
