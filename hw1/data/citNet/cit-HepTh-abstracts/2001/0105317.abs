  Some simple (namely, single-channel) correlation functions involving an
arbitrary number of fields are computed by means of a direct application of the
residue calculus, through partial fraction expansions. Examples are presented
in minimal models and parafermionic conformal theories. A generic factorized
expression is deduced for the corresponding single-channel structure constants.
