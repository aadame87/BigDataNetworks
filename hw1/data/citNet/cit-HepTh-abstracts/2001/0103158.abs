  We study the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of zero-modes of bulk
antisymmetric tensor fields on a non-compact extra dimension in the
Randall-Sundrum model. It is shown that in the Kaluza-Klein reduction on a
non-compact extra dimension we have in general a zero-mode depending on a fifth
dimension in addition to a conventional constant zero-mode in the Kaluza-Klein
reduction on a circle. We examine the localization property of these zero-modes
on a flat Minkowski 3-brane. In particular, it is shown that a 2-form and a
3-form on the brane can be respectively obtained from a 3-form and 4-form in
the bulk by taking the zero-mode dependent on the fifth dimension.
