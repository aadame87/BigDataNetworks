  We show that the mass of the Fayet hypermultiplet, which represents the
matter sector of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, may be induced through a
generalization of the central charge constraint usually proposed in the
literature. This mass showing up as a parameter of the supersymmetry
transformations, we conclude that it will stay unrenormalized at the quantum
level.
