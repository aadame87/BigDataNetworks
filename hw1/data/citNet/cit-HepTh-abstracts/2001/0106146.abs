  We demonstrate that an impulse action (`recoil') on a D-particle embedded in
a (four-dimensional) cosmological Robertson-Walker (RW) spacetime is described,
in a $\sigma$-model framework, by a suitably extended higher-order logarithmic
world-sheet algebra of relevant deformations. We study in some detail the
algebra of the appropriate two-point correlators, and give a careful discussion
as to how one can approach the world-sheet renormalization group infrared fixed
point, in the neighborhood of which the logarithmic algebra is valid. It is
found that, if the initial RW spacetime does not have cosmological horizons,
then there is no problem in approaching the fixed point. However, in the
presence of horizons, there are world-sheet divergences which imply the need
for Liouville dressing in order to approach the fixed point in the correct way.
A detailed analysis on the subtle subtraction of these divergences in the
latter case is given. In both cases, at the fixed point, the recoil-induced
spacetime is nothing other than a coordinate transformation of the initial
spacetime into the rest frame of the recoiling D-particle. However, in the
horizon case, if one identifies the Liouville mode with the target time, which
expresses physically the back reaction of the recoiling D-particle onto the
spacetime structure, it is found that the induced spacetime distortion results
in the removal of the initial cosmological horizon and the eventual stopping of
the acceleration of the Universe. In this latter sense, our model may be
thought of as a conformal field theory description of a (toy) Universe
characterized by a sort of `phase transition' at the moment of impulse,
implying a time-varying speed of light.
