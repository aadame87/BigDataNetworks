  The properties of brane-antibrane systems and systems of unstable D-branes in
Type II superstring theory are investigated using the formalism of
superconnections. The low-energy open string dynamics is shown to be probed by
generalized Dirac operators. The corresponding index theorems are used to
compute the chiral gauge anomalies in these systems, and hence their
gravitational and Ramond-Ramond couplings. A spectral action for the
generalized Dirac operators is also computed and shown to exhibit precisely the
expected processes of tachyon condensation on the brane worldvolumes. The
Chern-Simons couplings are thereby shown to be naturally related to Fredholm
modules and bivariant K-theory, confirming the expectations that D-brane charge
is properly classified by K-homology.
