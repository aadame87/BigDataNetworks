  A recent notion in theoretical physics is that not all quantum theories arise
from quantising a classical system. Also, a given quantum model may possess
more than just one classical limit. These facts find strong evidence in string
duality and M-theory, and it has been suggested that they should also have a
counterpart in quantum mechanics. In view of these developments we propose
"dequantisation", a mechanism to render a quantum theory classical.
Specifically, we present a geometric procedure to "dequantise" a given quantum
mechanics (regardless of its classical origin, if any) to possibly different
classical limits, whose quantisation gives back the original quantum theory.
The standard classical limit $\hbar\to 0$ arises as a particular case of our
approach.
