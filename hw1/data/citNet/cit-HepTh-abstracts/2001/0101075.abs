Title: Extended Lambda-Maxwell duality and related large class of dyonic and
  neutral exactly solvable 4D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton models discovered
Authors: Konstantin G. Zloshchastiev
Comments: by Lambda-Maxwell duality we imply the one between Maxwell-dilaton
  coupling and dilaton mass (cosmological) term; REVTeX 3.1, 5 t/c pp; v3:
  fixed misprint in (25), v4: slightly generalized (5), added suggested refs,
  v5: updated ref. [5] and added important paragraph explaining how new classes
  can be generated, v6: emphasized full separability as adviced by readers

  We report the discovered class of exact static solutions of several 4D
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton systems: string-induced, Liouville, trigonometric,
polynomial, etc., for three basic topologies (spherical, hyperbolical and flat)
being uniformly treated. In addition to the usual electric-magnetic duality
this class obeys a certain extended duality between Maxwell-dilaton coupling
and dilaton mass. Though major solutions we obtain are dyonic, the class also
comprises interesting neutral models.
  As a by-product, we significantly succeded in resolving of the two important
problems, one of which has been standing more than a decade (system with the
string-inspired exponential Maxwell-dilaton coupling and non-vanishing dilaton
mass) and another one - gravity coupled to massive neutral scalar field:
generalized Liouville, Sin(h), Cos(h) - is about fifty years old.
  Finally, we demonstrate the full separability of the static EMD system and
publicize the simple procedure of how to generate new integrability classes.
