  An unambiguous and slice-independent formula for the two-loop superstring
measure on moduli space for even spin structure is constructed from first
principles. The construction uses the super-period matrix as moduli invariant
under worldsheet supersymmetry. This produces new subtle contributions to the
gauge-fixing process, which eliminate all the ambiguities plaguing earlier
gauge-fixed formulas.
  The superstring measure can be computed explicitly and a simple expression in
terms of modular forms is obtained. For fixed spin structure, the measure
exhibits the expected behavior under degenerations of the surface. The measure
allows for a unique modular covariant GSO projection. Under this GSO
projection, the cosmological constant, the 1-, 2- and 3- point functions of
massless supergravitons all vanish pointwise on moduli space without the
appearance of boundary terms. A certain disconnected part of the 4-point
function is shown to be given by a convergent, finite integral on moduli space.
A general slice-independent formula is given for the two-loop cosmological
constant in compactifications with central charge c=15 and N=1 worldsheet
supersymmetry in terms of the data of the compactification conformal field
theory.
  In this paper, a summary of the above results is presented with detailed
constructions, derivations and proofs to be provided in a series of subsequent
publications.
