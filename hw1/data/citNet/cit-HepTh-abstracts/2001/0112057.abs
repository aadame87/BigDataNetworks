  We extend a non local and non covariant version of the Thirring model in
order to describe a many-body system with backward and umklapp scattering
processes. We express the vacuum to vacuum functional in terms of a non trivial
fermionic determinant. Using path-integral methods we find a bosonic
representation for this determinant which allows us to obtain an effective
action for the collective excitations of the system. By introducing a non local
version of the self-consistent harmonic approximation, we get an expression for
the gap of the charge-density excitations as functional of arbitrary
electron-electron potentials. As an example we also consider the case of a non
contact umklapp interaction.
