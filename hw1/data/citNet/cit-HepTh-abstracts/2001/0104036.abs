  Theory
Authors: Yuji Okawa and Hirosi Ooguri (Caltech)
Comments: 20 pages, LaTeX2e; v2: references added, typos corrected; v3: The
  proof improved. (The gauge theory proof of the Seiberg-Witten map is
  separated from discussion of its string theory origin.) References added.

  We derive an exact expression for the Seiberg-Witten map of noncommutative
gauge theory. It is found by studying the coupling of the gauge field to the
Ramond-Ramond potentials in string theory. Our result also proves the earlier
conjecture by Liu.
