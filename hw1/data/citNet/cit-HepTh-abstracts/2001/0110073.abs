  We study the constraints on models with extra dimensions arising from local
anomaly cancellation. We consider a five-dimensional field theory with a U(1)
gauge field and a charged fermion, compactified on the orbifold S^1/(Z_2 x
Z_2'). We show that, even if the orbifold projections remove both fermionic
zero modes, there are gauge anomalies localized at the fixed points. Anomalies
naively cancel after integration over the fifth dimension, but gauge invariance
is broken, spoiling the consistency of the theory. We discuss the implications
for realistic supersymmetric models with a single Higgs hypermultiplet in the
bulk, and possible cancellation mechanisms in non-minimal models.
