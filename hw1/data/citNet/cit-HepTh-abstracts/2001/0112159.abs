  We propose a new procedure to embed second class systems by introducing
Wess-Zumino (WZ) fields in order to unveil hidden symmetries existent in the
models. This formalism is based on the direct imposition that the new
 Hamiltonian must be invariant by gauge-symmetry transformations. An
interesting feature in this approach is the possibility to find a
representation for the WZ fields in a convenient way, which leads to preserve
the gauge symmetry in the original phase space. Consequently, the
gauge-invariant Hamiltonian can be written only in terms of the original
phase-space variables. In this situation, the WZ variables are only auxiliary
tools that permit to reveal the hidden symmetries present in the original
second class model. We apply this formalism to important physical models: the
reduced-SU(2) Skyrme model, the Chern-Simons-Proca quantum mechanics and the
chiral bosons field theory. In all these systems, the gauge-invariant
Hamiltonians are derived in a very simple way.
