Title: The Concept of a J-string and its Application for the Computation of the
  Planck Length and the Planck Mass

  Certain linear objects, termed physical lines, are considered, and initial
assumptions concerning their properties are introduced. A physical line in the
form of a circle is called a \emph{$J$-string}. It is assumed that a $J$-string
has an angular momentum whose value is $\hbar$. It is then established that a
$J$-string of radius $R$ possesses a mass $m_J$, equal to $h/2\pi c R$, a
corresponding energy, as well as a charge $q_J$, where $q_J = (hc/2\pi)^{1/2}$.
It is shown that this physical curve consists of indivisible line segments of
length $\ell_\Delta = 2\pi(hG/c^3)^{1/2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and
$G$ is the gravitational constant. Quantum features of $J$-strings are studied.
Based upon investigation of the properties and characteristics of $J$-strings,
a method is developed for the computation of the Planck length and mass
$(\ell^*_P, m^*_P)$. The values of $\ell^*_P$ and $m^*_P$ are computed
according to the resulting formulae (and given in the paper); these values
differ from the currently accepted ones.
