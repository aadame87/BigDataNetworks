  In this paper, we calculate the spectrum of scalar field fluctuations in a
bouncing, asymptotically flat Universe, and investigate the dependence of the
result on changes in the physics on length scales shorter than the Planck
length which are introduced via modifications of the dispersion relation. In
this model, there are no ambiguities concerning the choice of the initial
vacuum state. We study an example in which the final spectrum of fluctuations
depends sensitively on the modifications of the dispersion relation without
needing to invoke complex frequencies. Changes in the amplitude and in the
spectral index are possible, in addition to modulations of the spectrum. This
strengthens the conclusions of previous work in which the spectrum of
cosmological perturbations in expanding inflationary cosmologies was studied,
and it was found that, for dispersion relations for which the evolution is not
adiabatic, the spectrum changes from the standard prediction of
scale-invariance.
