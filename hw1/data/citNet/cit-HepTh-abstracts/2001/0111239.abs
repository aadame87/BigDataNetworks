  I consider the semiclassical approximation of the graded Chern-Simons field
theories describing certain systems of topological A type branes in the large
radius limit of Calabi-Yau compactifications. I show that the semiclassical
partition function can be expressed in terms of a certain (differential)
numerical invariant which is a version of the analytic torsion of Ray and
Singer, but associated with flat graded superbundles. I also discuss a
`twisted' version of the Ray-Singer norm, and show its independence of metric
data. As illustration, I consider graded D-brane pairs of unit relative grade
with a scalar condensate in the boundary condition changing sector. For the
particularly simple case when the reference flat connections are trivial, I
show that the generalized torsion reduces to a power of the classical
Ray-Singer invariant of the base 3-manifold.
