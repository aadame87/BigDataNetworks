  We give an explicit quantum super field construction of the N=2 super Casimir
WA(n)-algebras, which is obtained from supersymmetric Miura transformation for
the Lie superalgebra A(n,n-1). And also we give an extension of this algebra
including a super vertex operator which depends on simple root system of
A(n,n-1).
