  We discuss composite operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and their
realisations as superfields on different superspaces. The superfields that
realise various operators on analytic superspace may be different in the free,
interacting and quantum theories. In particular, in the quantum theory, there
is a restricted class of operators that can be written as analytic tensor
superfields. This class includes all series B and C operators in the theory as
well as some series A operators which saturate the unitarity bounds. Operators
of this type are expected to be protected from renormalisation.
