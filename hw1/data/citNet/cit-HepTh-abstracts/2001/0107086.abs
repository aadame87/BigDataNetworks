  We present a generalization of the five dimensional multigravity models to
six dimensions. The key characteristic of these constructions is that that we
obtain solutions which do not have any negative tension branes while at the
same time the branes are kept flat. This is due to the fact that in six
dimensions the internal space is not trivial and its curvature allows bounce
configurations with the above feature. These constructions give for the first
time a theoretically and phenomenologically viable realization of multigravity.
