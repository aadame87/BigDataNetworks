  In the limit of small velocities, the dynamics of half-BPS Yang-Mills-Higgs
solitons can be described by the geodesic approximation. Recently, it has been
shown that quarter-BPS states require the addition of a potential term to this
approximation. We explain the logic behind this modification for a larger class
of models and then analyse in detail the dynamics of two five-dimensional
dyonic instantons, using both analytical and numerical techniques.
Nonzero-modes are shown to play a crucial role in the analysis of these
systems, and we explain how these modes lead to qualitatively new types of
dynamics.
