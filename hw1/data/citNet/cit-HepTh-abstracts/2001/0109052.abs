Title: Dynamics of the spinning particle in one dimension
Authors: W. Machin
Comments: 14 pages, ams-latex, references added
\\
  The most general N=1 Lagrangian for the spinning particle with local
supersymmetry is found and the constraints of the system are analysed. The
Dirac quantisation of the model is also investigated.
