  We show that one can construct D-branes in parafermionic and WZW theories
(and their orbifolds) which have very natural geometrical interpretations, and
yet are not automatically included in the standard Cardy construction of
D-branes in rational conformal field theory. The relation between these
theories and their T-dual description leads to an analogy between these
D-branes and the familiar A-branes and B-branes of N=2 theories.
