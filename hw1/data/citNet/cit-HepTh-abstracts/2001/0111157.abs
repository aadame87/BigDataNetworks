  The Ising quantum chain with a peculiar twisted boundary condition is
considered. This boundary condition, first introduced in the framework of the
spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg quantum chain, is related to the duality
transformation, which becomes a symmetry of the model at the critical point.
Thus, at the critical point, the Ising quantum chain with the duality-twisted
boundary is translationally invariant, similar as in the case of the usual
periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions. The complete energy spectrum of
the Ising quantum chain is calculated analytically for finite systems, and the
conformal properties of the scaling limit are investigated. This provides an
explicit example of a conformal twisted boundary condition and a corresponding
generalised twisted partition function.
