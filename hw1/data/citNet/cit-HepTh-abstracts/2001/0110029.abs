  Positive frequency Wightman function and vacuum expectation values of the
energy-momentum tensor are computed for a massive scalar field with general
curvature coupling parameter and satisfying Robin boundary condition on a
uniformly accelerated infinite plate. The both regions of the right Rindler
wedge, (i) on the right (RR region) and (ii) on the left (RL region) of the
plate are investigated. For the case (ii) the electromagnetic field is
considered as well. The mode summation method is used with combination of a
variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula. This allows to present the
expectation values in the form of a sum of the purely Rindler and boundary
parts. Near the plate surface the vacuum energy-momentum tensor is dominated by
the boundary term. At large distances from the plate and near the Rindler
horizon the main contribution comes from the purely Rindler part. In the RL
region the vacuum energy density of the electromagnetic field is negative near
the horizon and is positive near the plate.
