Title: Starting--point of Supergravity
Authors: Vyacheslav A. Soroka
Comments: 7 pages, LATEX 2e. The report is submitted for the poster
  presentation at the Conference "Supergravity at 25" and for the publication
  in the Proceedings of this Conference, which will be at the C.N. Yang
  Institute for Theoretical Physics of SUNY in Stony Brook, New York, USA, 1-2

  In this report I wish to recall how the basic concepts and ingredients of
supergravity were formulated by Dmitrij V. Volkov and the present author in
1973-74 under the first investigation of the super-Higgs effect .
