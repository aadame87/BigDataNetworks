  The relation between BRST cohomology and the N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
action in 4 dimensions is discussed. In particular, it is shown that both off
and on shell N=1 SYM actions are related to a lower dimensional field
polynomial by solving the descent equations, which is obtained from the
cohomological analysis of linearized Slavnov-Taylor operator $\B$, in the
framework of Algebraic Renormalization. Furthermore we show that off and on
shell solutions differ only by a $\B$- exact term, which is a consequence of
the fact that the cohomology of both cases are same.
