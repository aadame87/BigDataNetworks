  Linear recursion relations for the instanton corrections to the effective
prepotential are derived for two cases of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories;
the first case with an arbitrary number of hypermultiplets in the fundamental
representation of an arbitrary classical gauge group, and the second case with
one hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of SU(N). The construction for
both cases proceed from the Seiberg-Witten solutions and the renormalization
group type equations for the prepotential. Successive iterations of these
recursion relations allow us to simply obtain instanton corrections to an
arbitrarily high order. Checks with previous results in the literature were
performed. Other theoretical properties and generalizations are also discussed.
