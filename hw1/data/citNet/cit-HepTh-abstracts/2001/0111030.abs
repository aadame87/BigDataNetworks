Title: A Cyclic Model of the Universe

  We propose a cosmological model in which the universe undergoes an endless
sequence of cosmic epochs each beginning with a `bang' and ending in a
`crunch.' The temperature and density are finite at each transition from crunch
to bang. Instead of having an inflationary epoch, each cycle includes a period
of slow accelerated expansion (as recently observed) followed by slow
contraction. The combination produces the homogeneity, flatness, density
fluctuations and energy needed to begin the next cycle.
