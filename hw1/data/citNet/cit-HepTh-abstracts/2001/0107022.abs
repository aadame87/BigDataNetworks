  We introduce the concept of superfield effective action in noncommutative N=1
supersymmetric field theories containing chiral superfields. One and two loops
low-energy contributions to the effective action are found for the
noncommutative Wess-Zumino model. The one loop Kahlerian effective potential
coincides with its commutative counterpart. We show that the two loops
nonplanar contributions to the Kahlerian effective potential are leading in the
case of small noncommutativity. The structure of the leading chiral corrections
to the effective action and the behaviour of the chiral effective potential in
the limit of large noncommutativity are also investigated.
