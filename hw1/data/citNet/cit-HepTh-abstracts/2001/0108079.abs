Title: Fuzzy Non-Trivial Gauge Configurations
Authors: Badis Ydri
Comments: 9 pages . Talk delivered in the MRST 2001 conference, University of
  Western Ontario, London, Ontario . To be published in the conference
  proceedings
\\
  In this talk we will report on few results of discrete physics on the fuzzy
sphere . In particular non-trivial field configurations such as monopoles and
solitons are constructed on fuzzy ${\bf S}^2$ using the language of K-theory,
i.e projectors . As we will show, these configurations are intrinsically finite
dimensional matrix models . The corresponding monopole charges and soliton
winding numbers are also found using the formalism of noncommutative geometry
and cyclic cohomology .
