  We report on joint work, past and in progress, with K.Fredenhagen and with
J.E,Roberts, on the quantum structure of spacetime in the small which is
dictated by the principles of Quantum Mechanics and of General Relativity; we
comment on how these principles point to a deep link between coordinates and
fields. This is an expanded version of a lecture delivered at the 37th Karpacz
School in Theoretical Physics, February 2001.
