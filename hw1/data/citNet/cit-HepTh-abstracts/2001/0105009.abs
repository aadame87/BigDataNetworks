  We extend calculational techniques for static solitons to the case of field
configurations with simple time dependence in order to consider quantum effects
on the stability of Q-balls. These nontopological solitons exist classically
for any fixed value of an unbroken global charge Q. We show that one-loop
quantum effects can destabilize very small Q-balls. We show how the properties
of the soliton are reflected in the associated scattering problem, and find
that a good approximation to the full one-loop quantum energy of a Q-ball is
given by $\omega - E_0$, where $\omega$ is the frequency of the classical
soliton's time dependence, and $E_0$ is the energy of the lowest bound state in
the associated scattering problem.
