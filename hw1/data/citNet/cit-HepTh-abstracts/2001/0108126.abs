  We study branes and open strings in a large class of orbifolds of a curved
background using microscopic techniques of boundary conformal field theory. In
particular, we obtain factorizing operator product expansions of open string
vertex operators for such branes. Applications include branes in Z2 orbifolds
of the SU(2) WZW model and in the D-series of unitary minimal models considered
previously by Runkel.
