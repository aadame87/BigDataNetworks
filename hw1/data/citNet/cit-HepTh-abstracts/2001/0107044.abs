  We consider warped compactifications of ${\cal M}$-theory to
three-dimensional Minkowski space on compact eight-manifolds. Taking all the
leading quantum gravity corrections of eleven-dimensional supergravity into
account we obtain the solution to the equations of motion and Bianchi
identities. Generically these vacua are not supersymmetric and yet have a
vanishing three-dimensional cosmological constant.
