  We discuss the relation between two different models which are recently
proposed as the model of localizing bulk gauge fields on a brane. In the former
model, the localization of gauge field is achieved by adding both bulk and
boundary mass terms while in the latter, it is done by taking into
consideration the coupling between the gauge field and the dilaton field (this
model is also regarded as the gauge theory with nontrivial dielectric
``constant''). We make a certain transformation for the gauge field in the
latter Lagrangian. As the result, we find those two models are closely related
to each other.
