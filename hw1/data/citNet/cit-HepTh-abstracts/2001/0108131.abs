  We construct a one-parameter set of intersecting D4-brane models, with six
stacks, that yield the (non-supersymmetric) standard model plus extra
vector-like matter. Twisted tadpoles and gauge anomalies are cancelled, and the
model contains all of the Yukawa couplings to the tachyonic Higgs doublets that
are needed to generate mass terms for the fermions.
  A string scale in the range 1-10 TeV and a Higgs mass not much greater than
the current bound is obtained for certain values of the parameters,
consistently with the observed values of the gauge coupling constants.
