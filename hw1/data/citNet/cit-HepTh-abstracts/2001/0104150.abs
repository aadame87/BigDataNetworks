  We obtain the localized gravity on the intersection of two orthogonal 
non-solitonic or solitonic 4-branes in D=6 in the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet
term. The tension of the intersection is allowed to exist unlike the case
without the Gauss-Bonnet term. We show that gravity could be confined to the
solitonic 4-branes for a particular choice of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. If the
extra dimensions are compactified with the $T^2/(Z_2\times Z_2)$ orbifold
symmetry, the mass hierarchy between the Planck scale and the weak scale can be
explained by putting our universe at the TeV intersection of positive tension
located at the orbifold fixed point.
