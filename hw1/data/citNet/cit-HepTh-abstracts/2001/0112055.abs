  We obtain exact expressions for the quasi-normal modes of various spin for
the BTZ black hole. These modes determine the relaxation time of black hole
perturbations. Exact agreement is found between the quasi-normal frequencies
and the location of the poles of the retarded correlation function of the
corresponding perturbations in the dual conformal field theory. This then
provides a new quantitative test of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
