Title: Pedagogical Reflections on Color Confinement in Chromostatics

  Abelian and nonabelian gauge invariant states are directly compared to
revisit how the unconfined abelian theory is expressed. It is argued that the
Yang-Mills equations have no obvious physical content apart from their relation
to underlying physical states. The main observation is that the physical states
of electrostatics can be regarded as point charges connected by a uniform
superposition of all possible Faraday lines. These states are gauge invariant
only in the abelian case.
