  Motivated by the formalism of string bit models, or quantum matrix models, we
study a class of simple Hamiltonian models of quantum gravity type in two
space-time dimensions. These string bit models are special cases of a more
abstract class of models defined in terms of the sl(2) subalgebra of the
Virasoro algebra. They turn out to be solvable and their scaling limit
coincides in special cases with known transfer matrix models of two-dimensional
quantum gravity.
