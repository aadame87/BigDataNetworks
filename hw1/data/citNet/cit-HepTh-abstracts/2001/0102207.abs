  We construct an intersecting brane configuration in six-dimensional space
with one extra space-like and one extra time-like dimensions. With a certain
additional symmetry imposed on the extra space-time we have found that
effective four-dimensional cosmological constant vanishes automatically,
providing the static solution with gravity fully localized at the intersection
region as there are no propagating massive modes of graviton. In this way, the
same symmetry allows us to eliminate tachyonic states of graviton from the
spectrum of the effective four-dimensional theory, thus avoiding
phenomenological difficulties comming from the matter instability usually
induced in theories with extra time-like dimensions.
