  We obtain a solution describing a gravitational shockwave propagating along a
Randall-Sundrum brane. The interest of such a solution is twofold: on the one
hand, it is the first exact solution for a localized source on a
Randall-Sundrum three-brane. On the other hand, one can use it to study forward
scattering at Planckian energies, including the effects of the continuum of
Kaluza-Klein modes. We map out the different regimes for the scattering
obtained by varying the center-of-mass energy and the impact parameter. We also
discuss exact shockwaves in ADD scenarios with compact extra dimensions.
