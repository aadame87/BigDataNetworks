  We find a new class of cosmic string solutions with non-vanishing magnetic
flux of $\cN=1$, D=4 supergravity with a cosmological constant and coupled to
any number of Maxwell and scalar multiplets. We show that these magnetic cosmic
string solutions preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry. We give an explicit example of
such a solution for which the complex scalars are constant and the spacetime is
smooth with topology $R^{1,1}\times S^2$. Two more examples are explored for
which a complex scalar field takes values in $\bC P^1$ and in $SL(2,\bR)/U(1)$.
