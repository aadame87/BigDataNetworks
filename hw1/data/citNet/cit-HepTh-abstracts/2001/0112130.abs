Title: A geometric approach to D-branes in group manifolds
Authors: Sonia Stanciu
Comments: 6 pages; based on talks given at the conference "Modern trends in
  string theory" (Lisbon, July 2001), and the RTN meeting "The quantum
  structure of spacetime and the geometric nature of fundamental interactions"
  (Corfu, September 2001)

  This is a brief review of some recent results on the geometric approach to
symmetric D-branes in group manifolds, both twisted and untwisted. We describe
the geometry of the gluing conditions and the quantisation condition in the
boundary WZW model, and we illustrate this by determining the consistent
twisted and untwisted D-branes in the Lie group SU_3.
