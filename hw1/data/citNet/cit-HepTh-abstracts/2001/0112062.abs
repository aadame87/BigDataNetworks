Title: Quantum Gauge Theory of Gravity
Authors: Ning Wu
Comments: 14 pages, no figure
\\
  The quantum gravity is formulated based on principle of local gauge
invariance. The model discussed in this paper has local gravitational gauge
symmetry and gravitational field is represented by gauge field. In leading
order approximation, it gives out classical Newton's theory of gravity. It can
also give out Einstein's field equation with cosmological constant. For
classical tests, it gives out the same theoretical predictions as those of
general relativity. This quantum gauge theory of gravity is a renormalizable
quantum theory.
