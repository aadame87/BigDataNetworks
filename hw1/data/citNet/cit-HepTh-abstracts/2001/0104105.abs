  We investigate the local geometry on the moduli space of G_2 structures that
arises in compactifications of M-theory on holonomy G_2 manifolds. In
particular, we determine the homogeneity properties of couplings of the
associated N=1, D=4 supergravity under the scaling of moduli space coordinates.
We then find some brane solitons of N=1, D=4 supergravity that are associated
with wrapping M-branes on cycles of the compact space. These include cosmic
strings and domain walls that preserve half of supersymmetry of the
four-dimensional theory, and non-supersymmetric electrically and magnetically
charged black holes. The geometry of some of the black holes is that of
non-extreme M-brane configurations reduced to four-dimensions on a seven torus.
