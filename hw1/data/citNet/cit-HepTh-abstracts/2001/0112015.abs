  We review the construction and phenomenology of intersecting brane worlds.
The breaking of chiral and supersymmetry together with a reduction of gauge
symmetry by introducing D-branes at generic angles into type I or type II
string compactifications is taken as a starting point for the engineering of
phenomenologically appealing four-dimensional vacua. Examples that come very
close to Standard Model and GUT physics are considered and issues like the
cancellation of anomalies and the emergence of global symmetries studied in
some detail. Concerning the gravitational backreaction, the perturbative
potential generated at the disc level is shown to lead to a run-away
instability of geometric moduli within the purely toroidal compactifications.
It can at least partly be avoided in certain orbifold vacua, where the relevant
moduli are frozen. These more restricted models still possess sufficient
freedom to find semi-realistic brane world orbifolds.
