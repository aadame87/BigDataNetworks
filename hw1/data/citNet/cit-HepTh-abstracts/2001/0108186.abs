  Free noncommutative fields constitute a natural and interesting example of
constrained theories with higher derivatives. The quantization methods
involving constraints in the higher derivative formalism can be nicely applied
to these systems. We study real and complex free noncommutative scalar fields
where momenta have an infinite number of terms. We show that these expressions
can be summed in a closed way and lead to a set of Dirac brackets which matches
the usual corresponding brackets of the commutative case.
