  In the presence of a boundary interaction, Neumann boundary conditions should
be modified to contain a function S of the boundary fields: (\nabla_N +S)\phi
=0. Information on quantum boundary dynamics is then encoded in the
$S$-dependent part of the effective action. In the present paper we extend the
multiple reflection expansion method to the Robin boundary conditions mentioned
above, and calculate the heat kernel and the effective action (i) for constant
S, (ii) to the order S^2 with an arbitrary number of tangential derivatives.
Some applications to symmetry breaking effects, tachyon condensation and brane
world are briefly discussed.
