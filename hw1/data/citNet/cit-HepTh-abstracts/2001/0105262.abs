  In the previous paper, we have introduced the Abelian tensor field together
with two parameters $\rho$ and $\sigma$ to rewrite the non-Abelian gauge theory
in maximal Abelian gauge into an Abelian effective theory, and we determined
the anomalous dimensions of Abelian tensor field and a parameter $\rho$ by
requiring the renormalizability with respect to Abelian effective theory. Then
we obtained the renormalizable Abelian Projected Effective Gauge Theory. In
this paper, the anomalous dimension of a parameter $\sigma$ is determined.
However, before proceeding to determine the anomalous dimension of $\sigma$, we
must modify the gauge fixing terms from the viewpoint of renormalizability. We
obtain the anomalous dimensions under this modification.
