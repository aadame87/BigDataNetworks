  In this talk we construct BPS-saturated domain walls in supersymmetric QCD,
for any values of the masses of the chiral matter superfields. We compare our
results to those already obtained in the literature and we also discuss their
range of applicability, as well as future directions that would be desirable to
explore in order to achieve a complete understanding of supersymmetric
gluodynamics as a step in improving our knowledge of how QCD works.
