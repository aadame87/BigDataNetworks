  We show that U(\infty) symmetry transformations of the noncommutative field
theory in the Moyal space are generated by a combination of two W_{1+\infty}
algebras in the Landau problem. Geometrical meaning of this infinite symmetry
is illustrated by examining the transformations of an invariant subgroup on the
noncommutative solitons, which generate deformations and boosts of solitons.
