Title: Soft Supersymmetry Breaking and the Supersymmetric Standard Model
Authors: Savas Dimopoulos
Comments: Invited talk presented at the "Thirty Years of Supersymmetry"
  Symposium, University of Minnesota, October 13-15, 2000

  We recall how the idea of Softly Broken Supersymmetry led to the construction
of the Supersymmetric Standard Model in 1981. Its first prediction, the
supersymmetric unification of gauge couplings, was conclusively verified by the
LEP and SLC experiments 10 years later. Its other predictions include: the
existence of superparticles at the electroweak scale; a stable lightest
superparticle (LSP) with a mass of $\sim 100$ GeV, anticipated to be a neutral
electroweak gaugino; the universality of scalar and gaugino masses at the
unification scale. The original motivation for the model, solving the hierarchy
problem, indicates that the superparticles should be discovered at the LHC or
the TeVatron.
