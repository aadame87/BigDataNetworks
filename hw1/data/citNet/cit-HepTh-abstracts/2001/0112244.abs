  A simple mechanism for SUSY breaking is proposed due to the coexistence of
BPS domain walls. It requires no messenger fields nor complicated SUSY breaking
sector on any of the walls. We assumed that our world is on a BPS domain wall
and that the other BPS wall breaks the SUSY preserved by our wall. We obtain an
${\cal N}=1$ model in four dimensions which admits an exact solution of a
stable non-BPS configuration of two walls. The stability is assured by a
topological quantum number associated with the winding on the field space of
the topology of $S^1$. We propose that the overlap of the wave functions of the
Nambu-Goldstone fermion and those of physical fields provides a practical
method to evaluate SUSY breaking mass splitting on our wall thanks to a
low-energy theorem. This is based on our recent works hep-th/0009023 and
hep-th/0107204.
