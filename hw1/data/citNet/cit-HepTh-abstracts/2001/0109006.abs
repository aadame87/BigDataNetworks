  Head-on collisions between two solitons in the pure $CP^1$ model on a flat
torus are investigated via numerical simulations. The charge-two lumps, written
out in terms of Weierstrass' elliptic $\wp$-function, are found to scatter at
90$^{\circ}$. The phenomenon of singularity formation is also seen.
