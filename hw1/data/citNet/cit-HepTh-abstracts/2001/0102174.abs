  We explored a variety of brane configurations in our previous paper within
the two derivative truncation of the unstable D9-brane effective theory. In
this paper we extend our previous results with emphasis on the inclusion of the
higher derivative corrections for the tachyon and the gauge fields computed in
the boundary string field theories. We give the exact solutions to BPS brane
configurations studied in our previous paper and find remarkable exact
agreements of their energies and RR-charges with the expected results. We
further find a few more solutions that we could not construct in the two
derivative truncations, such as a (F,D6) bound state ending on a D8-brane whose
existence turns out to be due to a higher derivative effect and also the
dielectric brane of Emparan and Myers as a nonsupersymmetric example. These are
also in exact agreements with the results obtained in the effective theory of
supersymmetric D-branes.
