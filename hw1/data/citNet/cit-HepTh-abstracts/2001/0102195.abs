  In this work we use the method of consistent deformations of the master
equation by Barnich and Henneaux in order to prove that an abelian topological
coupling between a zero and a two form fields in D=3 has no nonabelian
generalization. We conclude that a topologically massive model involving the
Kalb-Ramond two-form field does not admit a nonabelian generalization. The
introduction of a connection-type one form field keeps the previous result.
