  In previous papers we built (multiple) D-branes in flat space-time as
classical solutions of the string field theory based on the tachyon vacuum. In
this paper we construct classical solutions describing all D-branes in any
fixed space-time background defined by a two-dimensional CFT of central charge
26. A key role is played by the geometrical definition of the sliver state in
general boundary CFT's. The correct values for ratios of D-brane tensions arise
because the norm of the sliver solution is naturally related to the disk
partition function of the appropriate boundary CFT. We also explore the
possibility of reproducing the known spectrum of physical states on a D-brane
as deformations of the sliver.
