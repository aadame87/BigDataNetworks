\\
  A general construction of affine Non Abelian Toda models in terms of gauged
two loop WZNW model is discussed. Its connection to non relativistic models
corresponding to constrained KP hierarchies is established in terms of time
evolution associated to positive and negative grading of the Lie algebra.
