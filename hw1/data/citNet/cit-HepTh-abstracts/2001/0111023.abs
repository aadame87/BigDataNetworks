Title: The energy states of quantum dots through the variational method and SQM
Authors: Elso Drigo Filho and Regina Maria Ricotta
Comments: Talk given at the VII International Wigner Symposium, University of
  Maryland, College Park, USA, August 2001
\\
  The Variational Method is applied within the context of Supersymmetric
Quantum Mechanics to provide information about the energy states of a
hydrogenic donor in a quantum dot.
