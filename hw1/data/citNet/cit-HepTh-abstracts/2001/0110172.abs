  We study the dynamics of fuzzy two-spheres in a matrix model which represents
string theory in the presence of RR flux. We analyze the stability of known
static solutions of such a theory which contain commuting matrices and SU(2)
representations. We find that irreducible as well as reducible representations
are stable. Since the latter are of higher energy, this stability poses a
puzzle. We resolve this puzzle by noting that reducible representations have
marginal directions corresponding to non-spherical deformations. We obtain new
static solutions by turning on these marginal deformations. These solutions now
have instability or tachyonic directions. We discuss condensation of these
tachyons which correspond to classical trajectories interpolating from
multiple, small fuzzy spheres to a single, large sphere. We briefly discuss
spatially independent configurations of a D3/D5 system described by the same
matrix model which now possesses a supergravity dual.
