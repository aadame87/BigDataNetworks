  Affine su(3) and su(4) fusion multiplicities are characterised as discretised
volumes of certain convex polytopes. The volumes are measured explicitly,
resulting in multiple sum formulas. These are the first polytope-volume
formulas for higher-rank fusion multiplicities. The associated threshold levels
are also discussed. For any simple Lie algebra we derive an upper bound on the
threshold levels using a refined version of the Gepner-Witten depth rule.
