Title: Parity Doubling, Zitterbewegung, and Rest Mass for Spin 1
Author: Geoffrey F. Chew and Henry P. Stapp, (Lawrence Berkeley National
  Laboratory)
Comments: This paper shows how a generalization of Dirac's method of generating
  a finite velocity, hence nonzero mass, of a spin 1/2 particle built out of
  massless components works also for spin-1 particles, without any need to
  introduce spin-zero companions
Report-no: LBNL-49171

  A 6-component "wave function" (not field, but S-matrix interpretable) for a
massive spin-1 particle parallels the Dirac "chirality-doubled" 4-component
wave function for a spin-1/2 particle, by pairing two wave functions for same
spin but opposite "handedness". The correlated "opposite-parity" pair of
complex 3-vectors defines a fluctuating spin-correlated lightlike ``internal
velocity" as well as an independent "external rapidity". Extension from
fermions to vector bosons of the velocity-fluctuation ("zitterbewegung")
interpretation of rest mass weakens theoretical motivation for elementary
scalar bosons.
