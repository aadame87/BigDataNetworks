Title: Black Uniqueness Theorems
Authors: Pawel O. Mazur
Comments: 26 pages, Latex. I have reviewed here the classic by now developments
  in the mathematical theory of black holes which have led to the black hole
  uniqueness and the black hole no hair theorems

  I review the black hole uniqueness theorem and the no hair theorems
established for physical black hole stationary states by the early 80'. This
review presents the original and decisive work of Carter, Robinson, Mazur and
Bunting on the problem of no bifurcation and uniqueness of physical black
holes. Its original version was written only few years after my proof of the
Kerr-Newman et al. black hole uniqueness theorem has appeared in print. The
proof of the black hole uniqueness theorem relies heavily on the positivity
properties of nonlinear sigma models on the Riemannian noncompact symmetric
spaces with negative sectional curvature. It is hoped that the first hand
description of the original developments leading to our current understanding
of the black hole uniqueness will be found useful to all interested in the
subject.
