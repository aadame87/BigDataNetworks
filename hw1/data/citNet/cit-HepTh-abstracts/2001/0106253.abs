  We study Myers world-volume effective action of coincident D-branes. We
investigate a system of N_0 D0-branes in the geometry of Dp-branes with p=2 or
p=4. The choice of coordinates can make the action simplified and tractable.
For p=4, we show that a certain point-like D0-brane configuration solving
equations of motion of the action can expand to form a fuzzy two-sphere without
changing quantum numbers. We compare non-commutative D0-brane configurations
with dual spherical D(6-p)-brane systems. We also discuss the relation between
these configurations and giant gravitons in 11-dimensions.
