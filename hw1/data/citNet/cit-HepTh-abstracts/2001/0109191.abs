Title: Phenomenology of Particle Production and Propagation in String-Motivated
  Canonical Noncommutative Spacetime
Authors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia, Luisa Doplicher, Soonkeon Nam, Yun-Seok Seo
Comments: With respect to the experimental information available at the time of
  writing version 1 of this manuscript (hep-th/0109191v1) the situation has
  evolved significantly. Our remarks on the benefits of high-energy
  observations found additional encouragement from the results reported in
  hep-th/0209254
\\
  We outline a phenomenological programme for the search of effects induced by
(string-motivated) canonical noncommutative spacetime. The tests we propose are
based, in analogy with a corresponding programme developed over the last few
years for the study of Lie-algebra noncommutative spacetimes, on the role of
the noncommutativity parameters in the $E(p)$ dispersion relation. We focus on
the role of deformed dispersion relations in particle-production collision
processes, where the noncommutativity parameters would affect the threshold
equation, and in the dispersion of gamma rays observed from distant
astrophysical sources. We emphasize that the studies here proposed have the
advantage of involving particles of relatively high energies, and may therefore
be less sensitive to "contamination" (through IR/UV mixing) from the UV sector
of the theory. We also explore the possibility that the relevant deformation of
the dispersion relations could be responsible for the experimentally-observed
violations of the GZK cutoff for cosmic rays and could have a role in the
observation of hard photons from distant astrophysical sources.
