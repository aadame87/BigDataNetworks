  We analyze the superfield equations of the 4-dimensional N=4 SYM-theory using
light-cone gauge conditions and the harmonic-superspace approach. The harmonic
superfield equations of motion are drastically simplified in this gauge, in
particular, the basic harmonic-superfield matrices and the corresponding
harmonic analytic gauge connections become nilpotent on-shell.
