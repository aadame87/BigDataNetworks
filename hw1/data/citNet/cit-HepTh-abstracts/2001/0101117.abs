  Symmetry based approaches to the black hole entropy problem have a number of
attractive features; in particular they are very general and do not depend on
the details of the quantization method. However we point out that, of the two
available approaches, one faces conceptual problems (also emphasized by
others), while the second contains certain technical flaws. We correct these
errors and, within the new, improved scheme, calculate the entropy of
3-dimensional black holes. We find that, while the new symmetry vector fields
are well-defined on the ``stretched horizon,'' and lead to well-defined
Hamiltonians satisfying the expected Lie algebra, they fail to admit a
well-defined limit to the horizon. This suggests that, although the formal
calculation can be carried out at the classical level, its real, conceptual
origin probably lies in the quantum theory.
