Title: Weinberg's Approach and Antisymmetric Tensor Fields
Authors: Valeri V. Dvoeglazov (Universidad de Zacatecas)
Comments: Misprint in the equation(44b) corrected. After submission of the
  initial version I learnt about the previous paper hep-th/0110083 by S. I.
  Kruglov, which may have relations to this paper. 16 pp, ReVTeX file,
  presented at the VII Wigner Symposium, College Park, MD, USA, August 24-29,
  2001
Journal-ref: Hadronic J. 25 (2002) 137-158

  We extend the previous series of articles [HPA] devoted to finding mappings
between the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer formalism and antisymmetric tensor fields.
Now we take into account solutions of different parities of the Weinberg-like
equations. Thus, the Proca, Duffin-Kemmer and Bargmann-Wigner formalisms are
generalized.
