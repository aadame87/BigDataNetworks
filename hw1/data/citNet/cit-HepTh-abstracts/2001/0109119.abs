  We investigate the issue of regularization/renormalization in the presence of
a nontrivial background in the case of 1+1-(supersymmetric) solitons. In
particular we study and compare the commonly employed regularization methods
(mode- energy/momentum- cutoff and derivative regularization). We show that the
main point for a consistent regularization/renormalization is to find a
relation between the ``cutoffs'' in the vacuum and the nontrivial sector so
that they can be related in a consistent manner. For each scheme we give a
principle to derive this relation and to perform calculations in a consistent
way. These principles are simple and not restricted to two dimensions or
supersymmetric theories.
