  We argue that the BRST and the anti-BRST super symmetries in the
four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory can be spontaneously broken in a nonlinear
partial gauge due to ghost-anti-ghost condensation. However, we show that the
spontaneous BRST symmetry breaking can be avoided if we adopt the modified
Maximal Abelian gauge which is an orthosymplectic $OSp(4|2)$ invariant
renormalizable gauge proposed by the author to derive quark confinement. We
compare the Maximal Abelian gauge with the conventional $OSp(4|2)$ invariant
gauge proposed by Delbourgo-Jarvis and Baulieu-Thierry-Mieg. Finally, an
implication to the Gribov problem is briefly mentioned.
