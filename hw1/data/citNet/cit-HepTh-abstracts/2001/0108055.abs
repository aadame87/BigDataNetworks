  We study gravity in codimension-2 brane world scenarios with infinite volume
extra dimensions. In particular, we consider the case where the brane has
non-zero tension. The extra space then is a two-dimensional ``wedge'' with a
deficit angle. In such backgrounds we can effectively have the Einstein-Hilbert
term on the brane at the classical level if we include higher curvature
(Gauss-Bonnet) terms in the bulk. Alternatively, such a term would be generated
at the quantum level if the brane matter is not conformal. We study
(linearized) gravity in the presence of the Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane
in such backgrounds. We find that, just as in the original codimension-2
Dvali-Gabadadze model with a tensionless brane, gravity is almost completely
localized on the brane with ultra-light modes penetrating into the bulk.
