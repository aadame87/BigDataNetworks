  Quantum mechanics in a noncommutative plane is considered. For a general two
dimensional central field, we find that the theory can be perturbatively solved
for large values of the noncommutative parameter ($\theta$) and explicit
expressions for the eigenstates and eigenvalues are given. The Green function
is explicitly obtained and we show that it can be expressed as an infinite
series. For polynomial type potentials, we found a smooth limit for small
values of $\theta$ and for non-polynomial ones this limit is necessarily
abrupt. The Landau problem, as a limit case of a noncommutative system, is also
considered.
