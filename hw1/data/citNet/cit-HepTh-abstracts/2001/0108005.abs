  We identify a class of chiral models where the one-loop effective potential
for Higgs scalar fields is finite without any requirement of supersymmetry. It
corresponds to the case where the Higgs fields are identified with the
components of a gauge field along compactified extra dimensions. We present a
six dimensional model with gauge group U(3)xU(3) and quarks and leptons
accomodated in fundamental and bi-fundamental representations. The model can be
embedded in a D-brane configuration of type I string theory and, upon
compactification on a T^2/Z_2 orbifold, it gives rise to the standard model
with two Higgs doublets.
