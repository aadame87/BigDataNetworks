  We derive expressions for the phase-space of a particle of momentum $p$
decaying into $N$ particles, that are valid for any number of dimensions. These
are the imaginary parts of so-called `sunset' diagrams, which we also obtain.
The results are given as a series of hypergeometric functions, which terminate
for odd dimensions and are also well-suited for deriving the threshold
behaviour.
