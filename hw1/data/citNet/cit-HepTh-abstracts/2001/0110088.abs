  The most general geometrical scenario in which the brane-world program can be
implemented is investigated. The basic requirement is that it should be
consistent with the confinement of gauge interaction, the existence of quantum
states and the embedding in a bulk with arbitrary dimensions, signature and
topology.
  It is found that the embedding equations are compatible with a wide class of
Lagrangians, starting with a modified Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian as the
simplest one, provided minimal boundaries are added to the bulk.
 A non-trivial canonical structure is derived, suggesting a canonical
quantization of the brane-world geometry relative to the extra dimensions,
where the quantum states are set in correspondence with high frequency
gravitational waves. It is shown that in the cases of at least six dimensions,
there exists a confined gauge field included in the embedding structure. The
size of extra dimensions compatible with the embedding is calculated and found
to be different from the one derived with product topology.
