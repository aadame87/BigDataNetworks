  We reconsider the $CP^{1}$ model with the Hopf term by using the
Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) scheme, which is an improved version of the Dirac
quantization method. We also perform a semi-classical quantization of the
topological charge Q sector by exploiting the collective coordinates to
explicitly show the fractional spin statistics.
