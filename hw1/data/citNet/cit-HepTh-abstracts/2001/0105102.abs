Title: Introduction to the Superembedding Description of Superbranes
Authors: Dmitri Sorokin
Comments: LaTeX2e file, 11 pages. Invited lecture given at the XXXVII Karpacz
  Winter School "New Developments in Fundamental Interactions Theories"
  (February 6-15, 2000, Karpacz, Poland). To be published in Proceedings

\\
  Basics of the geometrical formulation of the dynamics of supersymmetric
objects are considered and its relation to conventional formulations of
superbranes is discussed. In particular, we demonstrate how the kappa-symmetry
of the Green-Schwarz formulation shows up from local worldvolume supersymmetry,
and briefly discuss applications of the superembedding approach.
