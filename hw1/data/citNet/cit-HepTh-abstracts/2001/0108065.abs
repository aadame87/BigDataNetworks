  We consider exact solutions of Einstein equations defining static black holes
parametrized by off-diagonal metrics which by anholonomic mappings can be
equivalently transformed into some diagonal metrics with coefficients being
very similar to those from the Schwarzschild and/or Reissner-N\"ordstrom
solutions with anisotropic renormalizations of constants. We emphasize that
such classes of solutions, for instance, with ellipsoidal symmetry of horizons,
can be constructed even in general relativity theory if off-diagonal metrics
and anholonomic frames are introduced into considerations. Such solutions do
not violate the Israel's uniqueness theorems on static black hole
configurations because at long radial distances one holds the usual
Schwarzschild limit. We show that anisotropic deformations of the
Reissner-N\"ordstrom metric can be an exact solution on the brane,
re-interpreted as a black hole with an effective electromagnetic like charge
anisotropically induced and polarized by higher dimension gravitational
interactions.
