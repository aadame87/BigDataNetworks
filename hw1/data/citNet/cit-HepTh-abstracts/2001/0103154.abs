  We show how the classical string dynamics in $D$-dimensional gravity
background can be reduced to the dynamics of a massless particle constrained on
a certain surface whenever there exists at least one Killing vector for the
background metric. We obtain a number of sufficient conditions, which ensure
the existence of exact solutions to the equations of motion and constraints.
These results are extended to include the Kalb-Ramond background. The
$D1$-brane dynamics is also analyzed and exact solutions are found. Finally, we
illustrate our considerations with several examples in different dimensions.
All this also applies to the tensionless strings.
