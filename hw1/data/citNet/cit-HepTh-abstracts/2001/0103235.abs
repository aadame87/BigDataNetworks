  We study the behaviour of Polyakov confining string in the Georgi-Glashow
model in three dimensions near confining-deconfining phase transition described
in hep-th/0010201. In the string language, the transition mechanism is the
decay of the confining string into D0 branes (charged W bosons of the
Georgi-Glashow model). In the world-sheet picture the world-lines of heavy D0
branes at finite temperature are represented as world-sheet vortices of a
certain type, and the transition corresponds to the condensation of these
vortices. We also show that the ``would be'' Hagedorn transition in the
confining string (which is not realized in our model) corresponds to the
monopole binding transition in the field theoretical language. The fact that
the decay into D0 branes occurs at lower than the Hagedorn temperature is
understood as the consequence of the large thickness of the confining string
and finite mass of the $D0$ branes.
