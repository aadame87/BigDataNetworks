  A new class of twistor-like string models in four-dimensional space-time
extended by the addition of six tensorial central charge (TCC) coordinates
$z_{mn}$ is studied. The Hamiltonian of tensionless string in the extended
space-time is derived and its symmetries are investigated. We establish that
the string constraints reduce the number of independent TCC coordinates
$z_{mn}$ to one real effective coordinate which composes an effective
5-dimensional target space together with the $x^{m}$ coordinates. We construct
the P.B. algebra of the first class constraints and discover that it coincides
with the P.B. algebra of tensionless strings. The Lorentz covariant
antisymmetric Dirac $\hat{\mathbf C}$-matrix of the P.B. of the second class
constraints is constructed and its algebraic structure is further presented.
