Title: The Stability of Matter and Landau Singularity in QED
Authors: Mofazzal Azam (BARC, MUMBAI, INDIA)
\\
  The theory of stability of relativistic matter seem to suggest that at high
enough energies Quantum Electrodynamics may not be a well behaved theory.We
show that this is true in the large flavour limit of QED. In this limit, Landau
singularity becomes exact.We refer to the analogy of this model with the theory
of weakly interacting electron system analysed by Feldman {\it et al} using
renormalisation group technique.We find an exact analogy between the Landau
singularity in QED and BCS instability in the condensed matter system.This
analogy clearly shows that Landau singularity in QED is associated with the
instability of perturbative ground state.
