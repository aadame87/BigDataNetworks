  The enhancon mechanism removes a family of time-like singularities from
certain supergravity spacetimes by forming a shell of branes on which the
exterior geometry terminates. The problematic interior geometry is replaced by
a new spacetime, which in the prototype extremal case is simply flat. We show
that this excision process, made inevitable by stringy phenomena such as
enhanced gauge symmetry and the vanishing of certain D-branes' tension at the
shell, is also consistent at the purely gravitational level. The source
introduced at the excision surface between the interior and exterior geometries
behaves exactly as a shell of wrapped D6-branes, and in particular, the tension
vanishes at precisely the enhancon radius. These observations can be
generalised, and we present the case for non-extremal generalisations of the
geometry, showing that the procedure allows for the possibility that the
interior geometry contains an horizon. Further knowledge of the dynamics of the
enhancon shell itself is needed to determine the precise position of the
horizon, and to uncover a complete physical interpretation of the solutions.
