  We propose a technique called dimensional descent to show that Wigner's
little group for massless particles, which acts as a generator of gauge
transformation for usual Maxwell theory, has an identical role even for
topologically massive gauge theories. The examples of $B\wedge F$ theory and
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory are analyzed in details.
