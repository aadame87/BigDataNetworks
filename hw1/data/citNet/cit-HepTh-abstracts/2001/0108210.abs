  D=2,N=2 generalized Wess-Zumino theory is investigated by the dimensional
reduction from D=4,N=1 theory. For each solitonic configuration (i,j) the
classical static solution is solved by the Hamilton-Jacobi method of equivalent
one-dimensional classical mechanics. It is easily shown that the Bogomol'nyi
mass bound is saturated by these solutions and triangular mass inequality
M_{ij}<M_{ik}+M_{kj} is automatically satisfied.
