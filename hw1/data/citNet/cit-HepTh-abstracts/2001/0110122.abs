  For the noncommutative torus ${\cal T}$, in case of the N.C. parameter$\theta
= \frac{Z}{n}$ and the area of ${\cal T}$ is an integer, we construct the basis
of Hilbert space ${\cal H}_n$ in terms of $\theta$functions of the positions
$z_i$ of $n$ solitons. The loop wrapping a$the torus generates the algebra
${\cal A}_n$. We show that ${\cal A}_$isomorphic to the $Z_n \times Z_n$

operators, which is the gener$$g$ of an elliptic $su(n)$, and transforms

A}_n$. By acting on ${\cal H}_n$ we establish the isomorphism of ${\cal A}_n$
and $g$. Th$is easy to give the projection operators corresponding to the

$\theta$ and the modulus of ${\cal T}$. The dynamics of solitons is determined
