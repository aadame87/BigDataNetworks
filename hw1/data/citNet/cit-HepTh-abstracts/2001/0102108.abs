  This is the second in a series of two contributions in which we set out to
establish a novel momentum space framework to treat field theoretical
infinities in perturbative calculations when parity-violating objects occur.
Since no analytic continuation on the space-time dimension is effected, this
framework can be particularly useful to treat dimension-specific theories.
Moreover arbitrary local terms stemming from the underlying infinities of the
model can be properly parametrized. We (re)analyse the undeterminacy of the
radiatively generated CPT violating Chern-Simons term within an extended
version of $QED_4$ and calculate the Adler-Bardeen-Bell-Jackiw triangle anomaly
to show that our framework is consistent and general to handle the subtleties
involved when a radiative corretion is finite.
