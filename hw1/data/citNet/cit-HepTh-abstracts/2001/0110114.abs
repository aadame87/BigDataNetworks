  Wigner's quasi-probability distribution function in phase-space is a special
(Weyl) representation of the density matrix. It has been useful in describing
quantum transport in quantum optics; nuclear physics; decoherence (eg, quantum
computing); quantum chaos; "Welcher Weg" discussions; semiclassical limits. It
is also of importance in signal processing.
  Nevertheless, a remarkable aspect of its internal logic, pioneered by Moyal,
has only emerged in the last quarter-century: It furnishes a third,
alternative, formulation of Quantum Mechanics, independent of the conventional
Hilbert Space, or Path Integral formulations. In this logically complete and
self-standing formulation, one need not choose sides--coordinate or momentum
space. It works in full phase-space, accommodating the uncertainty principle.
This is an introductory overview of the formulation with simple illustrations.
