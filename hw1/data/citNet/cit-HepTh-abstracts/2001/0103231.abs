  We revisit the problem of precursors in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
Identification of the precursors is expected to improve our understanding of
the tension between holography and bulk locality and of the resolution of the
black hole information paradox. Previous arguments that the precursors are
large, undecorated Wilson loops are found to be flawed. We argue that the role
of precursors should become evident when one saturates a certain locality
bound. The spacetime uncertainty principle is a direct consequence of this
bound.
