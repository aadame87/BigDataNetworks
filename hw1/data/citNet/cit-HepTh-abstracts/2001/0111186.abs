  Critical behaviour of the 2D scalar field theory in the LC framework is
reviewed. The notion of dynamical zero modes is introduced and shown to lead to
a non trivial covariant dispersion relation only for Continuous LC Quantization
(CLCQ). The critical exponent $\eta$ is found to be governed by the behaviour
of the infinite volume limit under conformal transformations properties
preserving the local LC structure. The $\beta$-function is calculated exactly
and found non-analytic, with a critical exponent $\omega=2$, in agreement with
the conformal field theory analysis of Calabrese et al.
