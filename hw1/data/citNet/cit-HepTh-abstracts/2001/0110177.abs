  Using the point-splitting regularisation, we calculate the axial anomaly in
an arbitrary even dimensional Non-Commutative (NC) field theory. Our result is
(star) gauge invariant in its {\it unintegrated} form, to the leading order in
the NC parameter.
 Exploiting the Seiberg Witten map, this result gets transformed to the
familiar Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in ordinary space-time. Furthermore, using
this map, we derive an expression for the unintegrated axial anomaly for
constant fields in NC space-time, that is valid to all finite orders of the NC
parameter.
