  The physics that is traditionally formulated in one--time-physics
(1T-physics) can also be formulated in two-time-physics (2T-physics). The
physical phenomena in 1T or 2T physics are not different, but the spacetime
formalism used to describe them is. The 2T description involves two extra
dimensions (one time and one space), is more symmetric, and makes manifest many
hidden features of 1T-physics. One such hidden feature is that families of
apparently different 1T-dynamical systems in d dimensions holographically
describe the same 2T system in d+2 dimensions. In 2T-physics there are two
timelike dimensions, but there is also a crucial gauge symmetry that thins out
spacetime, thus making 2T-physics effectively equivalent to 1T-physics. The
gauge symmetry is also responsible for ensuring causality and unitarity in a
spacetime with two timelike dimensions. What is gained through 2T-physics is a
unification of diverse 1T dynamics by making manifest hidden symmetries and
relationships among them. Such symmetries and relationships is the evidence for
the presence of the underlying higher dimensional spacetime structure.
2T-physics could be viewed as a device for gaining a better understanding of
1T-physics, but beyond this, 2T-physics offers new vistas in the search of the
unified theory while raising deep questions about the meaning of spacetime. In
these lectures, the recent developments in the powerful gauge field theory
formulation of 2T-physics will be described after a brief review of the results
obtained so far in the more intuitive worldline approach.
