\\
  Various ambiguous results on radiatively induced Lorentz and CPT violation in
quantum electrodynamics with a modified fermionic sector are reviewed and
possible explanations for this ambiguity appearing in the literature are
commentated. Furthermore, joint between stringent limit from astrophysical
observation and theoretical prediction on Lorenz and CPT violation is
discussed.
