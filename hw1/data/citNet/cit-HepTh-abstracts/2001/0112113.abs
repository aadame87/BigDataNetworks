  We construct several new G(2) holonomy metrics that play an important role in
recent studies of geometrical transitions in compactifications of M-theory to
four dimensions. In type IIA string theory these metrics correspond to D6
branes wrapped on the three-cycle of the deformed conifold and the resolved
conifold with two-form RR flux on the blown-up two-sphere, which are related by
a conifold transition. We also study a G(2) metric that is related in type IIA
to the line bundle over S^2 x S^2 with RR two-form flux. Our approach exploits
systematically the definition of torsion-free G(2) structures in terms of
three-forms which are closed and co-closed. Besides being an elegant formalism
this turns out to be a practical tool to construct G(2) holonomy metrics.
