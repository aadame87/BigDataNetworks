  We analyze the structure of noncommutative pure Chern-Simons theory
systematically in the axial gauge. We show that there is no IR/UV mixing in
this theory in this gauge. In fact, we show, using the usual BRST identities as
well as the identities following from vector supersymmetry, that this is a free
theory. As a result, the tree level Chern-Simons coefficient is not
renormalized. It also holds that the Chern-Simons coefficient is not modified
at finite temperature. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that the ghosts
completely decouple in the axial gauge in a noncommutative gauge theory.
