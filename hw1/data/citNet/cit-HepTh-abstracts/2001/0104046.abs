  The worldvolume theory of a D0-brane contains a multiplet of fermions which
can couple to background spacetime fields. This coupling implies that a
D0-brane may possess multipole moments with respect to the various type IIA
supergravity fields. Different such polarization states of the D0-brane will
thus generate different long-range supergravity fields, and the corresponding
semi-classical supergravity solutions will have different geometries. In this
paper, we reconsider such solutions from an eleven-dimensional perspective. We
thus begin by deriving the ``superpartners'' of the eleven-dimensional
graviton. These superpartners are obtained by acting on the purely bosonic
solution with broken supersymmetries and, in theory, one can obtain the full
BPS supermultiplet of states. When we dimensionally reduce a polarized
supergraviton along its direction of motion, we recover a metric which
describes a polarized D0-brane. On the other hand, if we compactify along the
retarded null direction we obtain the short distance, or ``near-horizon'',
geometry of a polarized D0-brane, which is related to finite $N$ Matrix theory.
The various dipole moments in this case can only be defined once the
eleven-dimensional metric is ``regularized'' and, even then, they are formally
infinite. We argue, however, that this is to be expected in such a
non-asymptotically flat spacetime. Moreover, we find that the superpartners of
the D0-brane, in this $r \ra 0$ limit, possess neither spin nor D2-brane dipole
moments.
