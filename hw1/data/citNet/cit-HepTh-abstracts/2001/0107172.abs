  We give a detailed discussion of the disk amplitudes with one closed string
insertion, which we used to construct the supergravity couplings of
noncommutative D-branes to the RR potentials, given in hep-th/0104139. We prove
the inclusion of Elliott's formula, the integer-valued modification of the
noncommutative Chern character, to all orders in the gauge field. We also give
a detailed comparison between the form of the result in which Elliott's formula
is manifest, and the form expressed in Matrix model variables.
