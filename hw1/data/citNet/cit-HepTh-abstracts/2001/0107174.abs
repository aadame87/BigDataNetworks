  We study static brane configurations in the bulk background of the
topological black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime. We find that such
configurations are possible even for flat black hole horizon, unlike the AdS
black hole case. We construct the brane world model with an orbifold structure
S^1/Z_2 in such bulk background. We also study massless bulk scalar field.
