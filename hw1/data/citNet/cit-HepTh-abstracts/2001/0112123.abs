  We argue that a spontaneous breakdown of local Weyl invariance offers a
mechanism in which gravitational interactions contribute to the generation of
particle masses and their electric charge. The theory is formulated in terms of
a spacetime geometry whose natural connection has both dynamic torsion and
non-metricity. Its structure illuminates the role of dynamic scales used to
determine measurable aspects of particle interactions and it predicts an
additional neutral vector boson with electroweak properties.
