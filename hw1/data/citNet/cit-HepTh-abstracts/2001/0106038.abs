  We consider the physics of enhancons as applied to four dimensional black
holes which are constructed by wrapping both D-branes and NS-branes on K3. As
was recently shown for the five dimensional black holes, the enhancon is
crucial in maintaining consistency with the second law of thermodynamics. This
is true for both the D-brane and NS-brane sectors of these black holes. In
particular NS5-branes in both type IIA and IIB string theory are found to
exhibit enhancon physics when wrapped on a K3 manifold.
