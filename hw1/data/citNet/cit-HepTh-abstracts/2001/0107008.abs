Title: Symmetric Spaces with Conformal Symmetry
Authors: Andre Wehner
Comments: 16 pages
\\
  We consider an involutive automorphism of the conformal algebra and the
resulting symmetric space. We display a new action of the conformal group which
gives rise to this space. The space has an intrinsic symplectic structure, a
group-invariant metric and connection, and serves as the model space for a new
conformal gauge theory.
