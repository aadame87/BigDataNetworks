  We consider a five-dimensional supergravity model with SU(5) gauge symmetry
and the minimal field content. Studying the arising scalar potential we find
that the gauging of the $U(1)_R$ symmetry of the five-dimensional supergravity
causes instabilities. Lifting the instabilities the vacua are of Anti-de-Sitter
type and SU(5) is broken along with supersymmetry. Keeping the $U(1)_R$
ungauged the potential has flat directions along which supersymmetry is
unbroken.
