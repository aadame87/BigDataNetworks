  We formulate Poisson Chern-Simons gauge theories on compact group manifolds.
These describe a sector of the large representation limit of noncommutative
Chern-Simons in the same way as the light-cone formulation of the membrane
action describe a sector of the large N Matrix model. While the formulation we
give is on a group manifold, only excitations that are invariant under the left
action of the stability group of a weight are allowed.
