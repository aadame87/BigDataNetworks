  We study tachyon condensation in a baby version of Witten's open string field
theory. For some special values of one of the parameters of the model, we are
able to obtain closed form expressions for the stable vacuum state and for the
value of the potential at the minimum. We study the convergence rate of the
level truncation method and compare our exact results with the numerical
results found in the full string field theory.
