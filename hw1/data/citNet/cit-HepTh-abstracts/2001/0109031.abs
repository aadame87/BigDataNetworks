  A family of solutions with mass and electric charge of five-dimensional
Chern-Simons supergravity is displayed. The action contains an extra term that
changes the value of the cosmological constant, as considered by Horava. It is
shown that the solutions approach asymptotically the Reissner-Nordstrom
spacetime. The role of the torsion tensor in providing charged solutions is
stressed.
