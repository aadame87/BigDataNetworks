  We consider the interplay between brane constructions and type IIA, IIB or
M-theory geometries on Calabi-Yau (CY) and G_2 holonomy manifolds. This is
related to N=1 (and N=2) gauge theories in four dimensions. We first discuss
simple geometric transitions corresponding to brane set ups involving
orthogonal (or parallel) Neveu-Schwarz branes that approach each other. This is
related to confinement and Seiberg duality in SQCD. In particular, we argue
that in type IIA, a CP^1 of singularities and one unit of Ramond-Ramond (RR)
flux is dual to a D6 brane wrapped on a Lens space, describing the UV and IR of
N=1 Super-Yang-Mills (SYM), respectively. Also, in the large N_c duality that
relates D6 branes on S^3 to an S^2 with RR flux, we implement the presence of
$N_f$ flavors of quarks. We then compactify M-theory on T^*(S^3) X S^1)/Z_2 and
observe that one phase describes SO(4) SYM in the UV and two others describe
confinement. Moreover, we consider compact 7-spaces (CY X S^1)/Z_2. We describe
transitions where disconnected S^3's approach and connect each other before
they vanish. These effects correspond to non-Abelian Higgs mechanism and
confinement. The similar transitions involving S^2 X S^1's are also considered.
Finally, we present transitions at finite distance in moduli space, where the
first Betti number b_1 of 3-cycles of singularities changes.
