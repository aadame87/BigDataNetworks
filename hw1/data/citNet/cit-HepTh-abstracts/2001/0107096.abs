  The large Nc expansion of N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge
group SU(Nc) has recently been shown to break down at singularities on the
moduli space. We conjecture that by taking Nc to infinity and approaching the
singularities in a correlated way, all the observables of the theory have a
finite universal limit yielding amplitudes in string theories dual to field
theories describing the light degrees of freedom. We explicitly calculate the
amplitudes corresponding to the Seiberg-Witten period integrals for an A_{n-1}
series of multicritical points as well as for other critical points exhibiting
a scaling reminiscent of the c=1 matrix model. Our results extend the matrix
model approach to non-critical strings in less than one dimension to
non-critical strings in four dimensions.
