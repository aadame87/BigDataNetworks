  We propose a cosmological scenario in which the hot big bang universe is
produced by the collision of a brane in the bulk space with a bounding orbifold
plane, beginning from an otherwise cold, vacuous, static universe. The model
addresses the cosmological horizon, flatness and monopole problems and
generates a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of density perturbations without
invoking superluminal expansion (inflation). The scenario relies, instead, on
physical phenomena that arise naturally in theories based on extra dimensions
and branes. As an example, we present our scenario predominantly within the
context of heterotic M-theory. A prediction that distinguishes this scenario
from standard inflationary cosmology is a strongly blue gravitational wave
spectrum, which has consequences for microwave background polarization
experiments and gravitational wave detectors.
