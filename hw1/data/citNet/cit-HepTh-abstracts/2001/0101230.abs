  This review is devoted to Anti-Grand Unification and to the Multiple Point
Model solution of problems of the unification of gauge interactions. According
to this model, near the Planck scale there exists a Multiple Critical Point
(MCP), where vacua of all fields existing in nature are degenerate. The MCP
rules over the evolution of all inverse finestructure constants in the Standard
model and beyond it.
