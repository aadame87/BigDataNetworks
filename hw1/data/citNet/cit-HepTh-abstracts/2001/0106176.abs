  We consider chiral condensates in SU(2) gauge theory with broken N=2
supersymmetry and one fundamental flavor in the matter sector. Matter and
gaugino condensates are determined by integrating out the adjoint field. The
only nonperturbative input is the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg one-instanton
superpotential. The results are consistent with those obtained by the
`integrating in' procedure. We then calculate monopole, dyon, and charge
condensates using the Seiberg-Witten approach. The key observation is that the
monopole and charge condensates vanish at the Argyres-Douglas point where the
monopole and charge vacua collide. We interpret this phenomenon as a
deconfinement of electric and magnetic charges at the Argyres-Douglas point.
