Title: Total Variation and Variational Symplectic-Energy-Momentum integrators
Authors: Jing-Bo Chen, Han-Ying Guo and Ke Wu

  A discrete total variation calculus with variable time steps is presented in
this letter. Using this discrete variation calculus, we generalize Lee's
discrete mechanics and derive variational symplectic-energy-momentum
integrators by Kane, Marsden and Ortiz. The relationship among discrete total
variation, Lee's discrete mechanics and Kane-Marsden-Ortiz's integrators is
explored.
