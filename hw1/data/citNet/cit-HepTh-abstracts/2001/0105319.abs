  In this short note we would like to discuss general solutions of the
Berkovits superstring field theory, in particular the string field action for
fluctuation around such a solution. We will find that fluctuations obey the
same equation of motion as the original field with the new BRST operator. Then
we will argue that the superstring field theory action for fluctuation field
has the same form as the original one.
