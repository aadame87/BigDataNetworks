  The exact renormalization group equation for pure quantum gravity is used to
derive the non-perturbative $\Fbeta$-functions for the dimensionless Newton
constant and cosmological constant on the theory space spanned by the
Einstein-Hilbert truncation. The resulting coupled differential equations are
evaluated for a sharp cutoff function. The features of these flow equations are
compared to those found when using a smooth cutoff. The system of equations
with sharp cutoff is then solved numerically, deriving the complete
renormalization group flow of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation in $d=4$. The
resulting renormalization group trajectories are classified and their physical
relevance is discussed. The non-trivial fixed point which, if present in the
exact theory, might render Quantum Einstein Gravity nonperturbatively
renormalizable is investigated for various spacetime dimensionalities.
