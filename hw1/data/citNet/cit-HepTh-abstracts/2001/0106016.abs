  Using a coherent state representation we derive many-body probability
distributions and wavefunctions for the Chern-Simons matrix model proposed by
Polychronakos and compare them to the Laughlin ones. We analyze two different
coherent state representations, corresponding to different choices for electron
coordinate bases. In both cases we find that the resulting probability
distributions do not quite agree with the Laughlin ones. There is agreement on
the long distance behavior, but the short distance behavior is different.
