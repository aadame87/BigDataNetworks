  We obtain the solution that corresponds to a screwed superconducting cosmic
string (SSCS) in the framework of a general scalar-tensor theory including
torsion. We investigate the metric of the SSCS in Brans-Dicke theory with
torsion and analyze the case without torsion. We show that in the case with
torsion the space-time background presents other properties different from that
in which torsion is absent. When the spin vanish, this torsion is a
$\phi$-gradient and then it propagates outside of the string. We investigate
the effect of torsion on the gravitational force and on the geodesics of a
test-particle moving around the SSCS. The accretion of matter by wakes
formation when a SSCS moves with speed $v $ is investigated. We compare our
results with those obtained for cosmic strings in the framework of
scalar-tensor theory.
