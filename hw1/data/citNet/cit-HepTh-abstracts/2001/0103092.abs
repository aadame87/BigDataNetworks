  Dixon's multipoles for a system of N relativistic positive-energy scalar
particles are evaluated in the rest-frame instant form of dynamics. The Wigner
hyperplanes (intrinsic rest frame of the isolated system) turn out to be the
natural framework for describing multipole kinematics. In particular, concepts
like the {\it barycentric tensor of inertia} can be defined in special
relativity only by means of the quadrupole moments of the isolated system.
