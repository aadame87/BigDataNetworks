  Spontaneous breaking of global symmetries can produce ``Alice'' strings: line
defects which make unbroken symmetries multivalued, induce apparent charge
violation via Aharonov-Bohm interactions, and form point defects when twisted
into loops. We demonstrate this behavior for both divergent and textured global
Alice strings. Both adiabatically scatter charged particles via effective
Wilson lines. For textured Alice strings, such Wilson lines occur at all radii,
and are multivalued only inside the string. This produces measurable effects,
including path-dependent charge violation.
