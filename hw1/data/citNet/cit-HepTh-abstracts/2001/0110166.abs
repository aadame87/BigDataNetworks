Title: Resolution of the causality paradox in quantum gravity
Author: T. A. Larsson
\\
  The metric determines the casual structure of spacetime, but in quantum
gravity it is also a dynamical field which must be quantized using this causal
structure. A radical resolution of this paradox is proposed: remove the concept
of space-like separation entirely. This can be done by describing all fields in
terms on p-jets, living on the observer's trajectory; all points on the
trajectory have time-like separations. Such a description is necessary to
construct well-defined projective representations of vect(4), which is the
correct symmetry algebra of general relativity. The limit p \to \infty, needed
to reconstruct the quantum fields throughout spacetime, only exists if both
bosons and fermions are present.
