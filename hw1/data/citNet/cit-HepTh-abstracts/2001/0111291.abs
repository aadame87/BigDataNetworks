  By considering 5--dimensional cosmological models with a bulk filled with a
perfect fluid and a cosmological constant, we have found regular instantonic
solution which is free from any singularity at the origin of the
extra--coordinate and describe 5--dimensional asymptotically anti de Sitter
wormhole, when the bulk has a topology $ R \times S^4 $ and is filled with dust
and a negative cosmological constant. Compactified brane-world instantons which
are built up from such instantonic solution describe either a single brane or a
string of branes. Their analytical continuation to the pseudo--Riemannian
metric can give rise to either 4-dimensional inflating branes or solutions with
the same dynamical behaviour for extra--dimension and branes, in addition to
multitemporal solutions. Dust brane-world models with other spatial topologies
are also considered.
