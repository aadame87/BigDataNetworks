  We establish a theorem about non-trivial 11D supergravity fluctuations that
are conformally related to flat superspace geometry. Under the assumption that
a theory of conformal 11D supergravity exists, similar in form to that of
previously constructed theories in lower dimensions, this theorem demands the
appearance of non-vanishing dimension 1/2 torsion tensors in order to
accommodate a non-trivial 11D conformal compensator and thus M-theory
corrections that break super-conformal symmetry. At the complete non-linear
level, a presentation of a conventional minimal superspace realization of Weyl
symmetry in eleven dimensional superspace is also described. All of our results
taken together imply that there exists some realization of conformal symmetry
relevant for the M-theory effective action. We thus led to conjecture this is
also true for the full and complete M-theory.
