  This contribution presents the running triple-gluon-vertex coupling constant,
g_lambda, in Hamiltonians for the gluons that are characterized by the size
1/lambda. The coupling constant is obtained from renormalization group
equations for effective particles in canonical light-front QCD in third order
perturbation theory. lambda plays the role of a finite cutoff parameter and is
varied from 100 Gev down to 100 MeV.
