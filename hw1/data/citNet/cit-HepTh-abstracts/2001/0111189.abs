  The analysis of D-branes in coset models G/H provides a natural extension of
recent studies on branes in WZW-theory and it has various interesting
applications to physically relevant models. In this work we develop a reduction
procedure that allows to construct the non-commutative gauge theories which
govern the dynamics of branes in G/H. We obtain a large class of solutions and
interprete the associated condensation processes geometrically. The latter are
used to propose conservation laws for the dynamics of branes in coset models at
large level k. In super-symmetric theories, conserved charges are argued to
take their values in the representation ring of the denominator theory.
Finally, we apply the general results to study boundary fixed points in two
examples, namely for parafermions and minimal models.
