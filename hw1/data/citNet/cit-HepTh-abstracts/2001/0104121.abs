  The article is a natural continuation of the papers by Gavrilov and Gitman
(Class.Quant.Grav. {\bf 17} (2000) L133; Int. J. Mod. Phys. A15 (2000) 4499)
devoted to relativistic particle quantization. Here we generalize the problem,
considering the quantization of a spinning particle in arbitrary gravitational
background. The nontriviality of such a generalization is related to the
neccessity of solving complicated ordering problems. Similar to the flat
space-time case, we show in the course of the canonical quantization how a
consistent relativistic quantum mechanics of spinning particle in gravitational
and electromagnetic backgrounds can be constructed.
