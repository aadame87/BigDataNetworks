  We consider the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field in the background
of spherically symmetric dielectrics, subject to a cut-off frequency in the
dispersion relations. The effect of this frequency dependent boundary condition
between media is described in terms of the {\it incomplete} $\zeta$-functions
of the problem. The use of the Debye asymptotic expansion for Bessel functions
allows to determine the dominant (volume, area, ...) terms in the Casimir
energy. The application of these expressions to the case of a gas bubble
immersed in water is discussed, and results consistent with Schwinger's
proposal about the role the Casimir energy plays in sonoluminescence are found.
