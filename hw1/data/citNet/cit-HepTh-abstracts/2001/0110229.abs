  By rigorous reanalysis of the results, we have proven that the propagators at
finite temperature for scalar bound states in one-generation fermion condensate
scheme of electroweak symmetry breaking are in fact identical in the
imaginary-time and the real-time formalism. This dismisses the doubt about
possible discrepancy between the two formalisms in this problem. Identity of
the derived thermal transformation matrices of the real-time matrix propagators
for scalar bound states without and with chemical potential and the ones for
corresponding elementary scalar particles shows similarity of thermodynamic
property between the two types of particles. Only one former inference is
modified, i.e. when the two flavors of fermions have unequal nonzero masses,
the amplitude of the composite Higgs particle will decay instead grow in time.
