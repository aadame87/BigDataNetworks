  A uniformly accelerated system will get thermally excited due to interactions
with the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields. This is the Unruh effect.
Also a system accelerated in a circular orbit will be heated, but in this case
complications arise relative to the linear case. An interesting question is in
what sense the real quantum effects for orbital and spin motion of a
circulating electron can be viewed as a demonstration of the Unruh effect. This
question has been studied and debated. I review some of the basic points
concerning the relation to the Unruh effect, and in particular look at how the
electron can be viewed as a thermometer or detector that probes thermal and
other properties of the vacuum state in the accelerated frame.
