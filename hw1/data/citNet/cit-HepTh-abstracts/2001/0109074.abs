  We discuss physical implications of the four-dimensional effective
supergravity, that describes low-energy physics of the Randall--Sundrum model
with moduli fields in the bulk and charged chiral matter living on the branes.
Cosmological constant can be cancelled through the introduction of a brane
Polonyi field and a brane superpotential for the 4d dilaton. We deduce a
generalization of the effective 4d action to the case of a general, not
necessarily exponential, warp factor. We note, that breakdown of supersymmetry
in generic warped models may lead to the stabilization of the interbrane
distance.
