  General model of multidimensional $R^2$-gravity including Riemann tensor
square term (non-zero $c$ case) is considered. The number of brane-worlds in
such model is constructed (mainly in five dimensions) and their properties are
discussed. Thermodynamics of S-AdS BH (with boundary) is presented when
perturbation on $c$ is used. The entropy, free energy and energy are
calculated. For non-zero $c$ the entropy (energy) is not proportional to the
area (mass). The equation of motion of brane in BH background is presented as
FRW equation. Using dual CFT description it is shown that dual field theory is
not conformal one when $c$ is not zero. In this case the holographic entropy
does not coincide with BH entropy (they coincide for Einstein gravity or $c=0$
HD gravity where AdS/CFT description is well applied).
  Asymmetrically warped background (analog of charged AdS BH) where Lorentz
invariance violation occurs is found. The cosmological 4d dS brane connecting
two dS bulk spaces is formulated in terms of parameters of $R^2$-gravity.
Within proposed dS/CFT correspondence the holographic conformal anomaly from
five-dimensional higher derivative gravity in de Sitter background is
evaluated.
