  In the presence of a non-vanishing chemical potential the eigenvalues of the
Dirac operator become complex. We calculate spectral correlation functions of
complex eigenvalues using a random matrix model approach. Our results apply to
non-Hermitian Dirac operators in three-dimensional QCD with broken flavor
symmetry and in four-dimensional QCD in the bulk of the spectrum. The
derivation follows earlier results of Fyodorov, Khoruzhenko and Sommers for
complex spectra exploiting the existence of orthogonal polynomials in the
complex plane. Explicit analytic expressions are given for all microscopic
k-point correlation functions in the presence of an arbitrary even number of
massive quarks, both in the limit of strong and weak non-Hermiticity. In the
latter case the parameter governing the non-Hermiticity of the Dirac matrices
is identified with the influence of the chemical potential.
