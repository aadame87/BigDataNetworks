  We derive dynamical equations to describe a single 3-brane containing fluid
matter and a scalar field coupling to the dilaton and the gravitational field
in a five dimensional bulk. First, we show that a scalar field or an arbitrary
fluid on the brane cannot evolve to cancel the cosmological constant in the
bulk. Then we show that the Randall-Sundrum model is unstable under small
deviations from the fine-tuning between the brane tension and the bulk
cosmological constant and even under homogeneous gravitational perturbations.
Implications for brane world cosmologies are discussed.
