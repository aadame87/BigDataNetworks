  We study the parity breaking effective action in 2+1 dimensions, generated,
at finite temperature, by massive fermions interacting with a non-Abelian gauge
background. We explicitly calculate, in the static limit, parity violating
amplitudes up to the seven point function, which allows us to determine the
corresponding effective actions. We derive the exact parity violating effective
action when $\vec{E}=0$. When $\vec{E}\neq 0$, there are families of terms that
can be determined order by order in perturbation theory. We attempt to
generalize our results to non-static backgrounds through the use of time
ordered exponentials and prove gauge invariance, both {\it small} and {\it
large}, of the resulting effective action. We also point out some open
questions that need to be further understood.
