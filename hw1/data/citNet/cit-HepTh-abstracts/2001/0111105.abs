  We consider supersymmetry algebras in arbitrary spacetime dimension and
signature. Minimal and maximal superalgebras are given for single and extended
supersymmetry. It is seen that the supersymmetric extensions are uniquely
determined by the properties of the spinor representation, which depend on the
dimension $D$ mod 8 and the signature $|\rho|$ mod 8 of spacetime.
