  In the preceding paper (Phys. Lett. B463 (1999) 257), the authors presented a
q-analog of the ADHMN construction and obtained a family of anti-selfdual
configurations with a parameter q for classical SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in
four-dimensional Euclidean space. The family of solutions can be seen as a
q-analog of the single BPS monopole preserving (anti-)selfduality. Further
discussion is made on the relation to axisymmetric ansatz on anti-selfdual
equation given by Witten in the late seventies. It is found that the
q-exponential functions familiar in q-analysis appear as analytic functions
categorizing the anti-selfdual configurations yielded by axisymmetric ansatz.
