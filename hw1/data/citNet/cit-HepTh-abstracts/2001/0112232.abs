  Symmetry

\\
  Bosonization of the extended Thirring model with SU(2) symmetry in the
Minkowski path integral method is discussed. We argue that it is not an easy
task to bosonize such a model if we derive correctly the fermion determinant
which is induced with the decoupling transformation because it seems that there
arise ghost fields. This is contrary to what is shown in a textbook and some
people believe.
