  The free field realization of the eight-vertex model is extended to form
factors. It is achieved by constructing off-diagonal with respect to the ground
state sectors matrix elements of the $\Lambda$ operator which establishes a
relation between corner transfer matrices of the eight-vertex model and of the
SOS model. As an example, the two-particle form factor of the $\sigma^z$
operator is evaluated explicitly.
