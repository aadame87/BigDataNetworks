  In this paper we consider superstring propagation in a nontrivial NS-NS
background. We deform the world sheet stress tensor and supercurrent with an
infinitesimal B_{\mu\nu} field. We construct the gauge-covariant super-Poincare
generators in this background and show that the B_{\mu\nu} field spontaneously
breaks spacetime supersymmetry. We find that the gauge-covariant spacetime
momenta cease to commute with each other and with the spacetime supercharges.
We construct a set of "magnetic" super-Poincare generators that are conserved
for constant field strength H_{\mu\nu\lambda}, and show that these generators
obey a "magnetic" extension of the ordinary supersymmetry algebra.
