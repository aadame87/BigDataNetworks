  It has been observed recently by Giovanni Amelino-Camelia \cite{gac1, gac2}
that the hypothesis of existence of a minimal observer-independent (Planck)
length scale is hard to reconcile with special relativity. As a remedy he
postulated to modify special relativity by introducing an observer-independent
length scale. In this letter we set forward a proposal how one should modify
the principles of special relativity, so as to assure that the values of mass
and length scales are the same for any inertial observer. It turns out that one
can achieve this by taking dispersion relations such that the speed of light
goes to infinity for finite momentum (but infinite energy), proposed e.g., in
the framework of the quantum $\kappa$-Poincar\'e symmetry. It follows that at
the Planck scale the world may be non-relativistic.
