  We propose the exact boundary S matrix for breathers of the N=2
supersymmetric sine-Gordon model. We argue that this S matrix has three
independent parameters, in agreement with a recently-proposed action. We also
show, contrary to a previous claim, that the ``universal'' supersymmetric
boundary S matrix commutes with two supersymmetry charges. General N=2
supersymmetric boundary integrable models are expected to have boundary S
matrices with a similar structure.
