  We first obtain the analogue of Vaidya's solution on the brane for studying
the collapse of null fluid onto a flat Minkowski cavity on the brane. Since the
back-reaction of the bulk onto the brane is supposed to strengthen gravity on
the brane, it would favour formation of black hole as against naked
singularity. That is the parameter window in the initial data set giving rise
to naked singularity in the 4D Vaidya case would now get partially covered.
