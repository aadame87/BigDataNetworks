  We study the Coulomb-Higgs duality of N=2 supersymmetric Abelian Chern-Simons
theories in 2+1 dimensions, by compactifying dual pairs on a circle of radius R
and comparing the resulting N=(2,2) theories in 1+1 dimensions. Below the
compactification scale, the theory on the Higgs branch reduces to the
non-linear sigma model on a toric manifold. In the dual theory on the Coulomb
branch, the Kaluza-Klein modes generate an infinite tower of contributions to
the superpotential. After resummation, in the limit R->0 the superpotential
becomes that of the Landau-Ginzburg model which is the two-dimensional mirror
of the toric sigma model. We further examine the conjecture of all-scale
three-dimensional mirror symmetry and observe that it is consistent with mirror
symmetry in 1+1 dimensions.
