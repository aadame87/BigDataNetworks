  Covariant relativistic quantum theory is used to study the covariant Green's
function, which can be used to determine the proper time evolved wave functions
that are solutions to the covariant Schr\"odinger type equation for a massive
spin zero particle. The concept of covariant action is used to obtain the
Green's function for an accelerated relativistic particle.
