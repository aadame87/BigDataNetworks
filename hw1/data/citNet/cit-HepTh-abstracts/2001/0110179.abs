Title: Noncommutative Differential Geometry and Classical Field Theory on
  Finite Groups
Authors: Jian Dai, Xing-Chang Song (Peking University)
Comments: LaTeX, 15 pages, with amssymb.sty; no figures or tables. Based on the
  report on the Seminar "Field Theory, Gravity and Symplectic Structure" [China
  Center of Advanced Science and Technology (CCAST) & World Laboratory (WL),
  Beijing, July 9th to July 13rd, 2001]
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematical Physics
Journal-ref: CCAST-WL workshop series 143 (2002) 143-157

  Plan of this report is given below: 1. Motivation from Physical and
Mathematical Point of View; 2. Differential Calculi on Finite Groups; 3.
Metrics; 4. Lagrangian Field Theory and Symplectic Structure; 5. Scalar Field
Theory and Spectral of Finite Groups.
