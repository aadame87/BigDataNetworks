  One shows here the existence of solutions to the Callan-Symanzik equation for
the non-Abelian SU(2) Chern-Simons-matter model which exhibits asymptotic
conformal invariance to every order in perturbative theory. The conformal
symmetry in the classical domain is shown to hold by means of a local criteria
based on the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. By using the recently
exhibited regimes for the dependence between the several couplings in which the
set of $\beta$-functions vanish, the asymptotic conformal invariance of the
model appears to be valid in the quantum domain. By considering the SU(n) case
the possible non validity of the proof for a particular n would be merely
accidental.
