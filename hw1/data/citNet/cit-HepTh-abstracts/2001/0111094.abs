  We study the algebra ${\cal A}_n$ and the basis of the Hilbert space ${\cal
H}_n$ in terms of the $\theta$ functions of the positions of $n$ solitons. Then
we embed the Heisenberg group as the quantum operator factors in the
representation of the transfer matrice of various integrable models. Finally we
generalize our result to the generic $\theta$ case.
