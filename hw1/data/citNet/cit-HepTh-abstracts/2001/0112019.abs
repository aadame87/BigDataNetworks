  An analysis of a spherically symmetric braneworld configuration is performed
when the intrinsic curvature scalar is included in the bulk action; the
vanishing of the electric part of the Weyl tensor is used as the boundary
condition for the embedding of the brane in the bulk. All the solutions outside
a static localized matter distribution are found; some of them are of the
Schwarzschild-(A)dS_{4} form. Two modified Oppenheimer-Volkoff interior
solutions are also found; one is matched to a Schwarzschild-(A)dS_{4} exterior,
while the other does not. A non-universal gravitational constant arises,
depending on the density of the considered object; however, the conventional
limits of the Newton's constant are recovered. An upper bound of the order of
TeV for the energy string scale is extracted from the known solar system
measurements (experiments). On the contrary, in usual brane dynamics, this
string scale is calculated to be larger than TeV.
