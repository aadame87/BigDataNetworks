  We study Vafa's geometric transition from a brane setup in M-theory. In this
transition D5 branes wrapped on P^1 cycles of a resolved conifold disappear and
are replaced by fluxes on a deformed conifold. In the limit of small sized P^1,
we describe this mechanism as a transition from curved M5 branes to plane M5
branes which replaces SU(N) MQCD by U(1) theories on the bulk. This agrees with
the results expected from the geometric transition. We also discuss the
reduction to ten dimensions and a brane creation mechanism in the presence of
fluxes.
