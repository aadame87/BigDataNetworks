Title: On Critical Phenomena in a Noncommutative Space
Authors: Guang-Hong Chen and Yong-Shi Wu
Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures, the relevance of star product structure in low
  energy effective theory is clarified, the presentation is improved

  In this paper we demonstrate that coordinate noncommutativity at short
distances can show up in critical phenomena through UV-IR mixing. In the
symmetric phase of the Landau-Ginsburg model, noncommutativity is shown to give
rise to a non-zero anomalous dimension at one loop, and to cause instability
towards a new phase at large noncommutativity. In particular, in less than four
dimensions, the one-loop critical exponent $\eta$ is non-vanishing at the
Wilson-Fisher fixed point.
