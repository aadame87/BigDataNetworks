  implications for a non-conformal dS/CFT correspondence. Second revision

  The status of exponential scalar potentials in supergravity is reviewed, and
updated. One version of N=8 D=4 supergravity with a positive exponential
potential, obtainable from a `non-compactification' of M-theory, is shown to
have an accelerating cosmological solution that realizes `eternal
quintessence'. Some implications for a de Sitter version of the domain wall/QFT
correspondence are discussed.
