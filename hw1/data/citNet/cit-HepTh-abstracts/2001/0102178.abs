  The RR Page charges for the D2-, D4-, D6-brane in B fields are constructed
explicitly from the equations of motion and the nonvanishing (modified) Bianchi
identities by exploiting their properties --- conserved and localized. It is
found that the RR Page charges are independent of the backgound B fields, which
provides further evidence that the RR Page charge should be quantized. In our
construction, it is highly nontrivial that the terms like B x B x B, B x B x F,
B x F x F from different sources are exactly cancelled with each other.
