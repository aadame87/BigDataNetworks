Title: Self-tuning solutions of the cosmological constant
Author: Jihn E. Kim
Comments: Latex file of 9 pages. Talk presented at SUSY'01, Dubna, Russia,

  I briefly review the cosmological constant problem and attempts toward its
solution, and present the first nontrivial example for the self-tuning
mechanism with a $1/H^2$ term with the antisymmetric field strength $H_{MNPQ}$
in a 5D RS-II setup.
