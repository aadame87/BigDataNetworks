  The spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the double compactified D=11 supermembrane
with non-trivial central charge or equivalently the non-commutative symplectic
super Maxwell theory is analyzed. In distinction to what occurs for the D=11
supermembrane in Minkowski target space where the bosonic potential presents
string-like spikes which render the spectrum of the supersymmetric model
continuous, we prove that the potential of the bosonic compactified membrane
with non-trivial central charge is strictly positive definite and becomes
infinity in all directions when the norm of the configuration space goes to
infinity. This ensures that the resolvent of the bosonic Hamiltonian is
compact. We find an upper bound for the asymptotic distribution of the
eigenvalues.
