  We study N=1 four dimensional quiver theories arising on the worldvolume of
D3-branes at del Pezzo singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We argue that
under local mirror symmetry D3-branes become D6-branes wrapped on a three torus
in the mirror manifold. The type IIB (p,q) 5-brane web description of the local
del Pezzo, being closely related to the geometry of its mirror manifold,
encodes the geometry of 3-cycles and is used to obtain gauge groups, quiver
diagrams and the charges of the fractional branes.
