  In usual dimensional counting, momentum has dimension one. But a function
f(x), when differentiated n times, does not always behave like one with its
power smaller by n. This inevitable uncertainty may be essential in general
theory of renormalization, including quantum gravity. As an example, we
classify possible singularities of a potential for the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation, assuming that the potential V has at least one $C^2$ class eigen
function. The result crucially depends on the analytic property of the eigen
function near its 0 point.
