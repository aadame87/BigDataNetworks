  We perform the Batalin-Vilkovisky analysis of gauge-fixing for graded
Chern-Simons theories. Upon constructing an appropriate gauge-fixing fermion,
we implement a Landau-type constraint, finding a simple form of the gauge-fixed
action. This allows us to extract the associated Feynman rules taking into
account the role of ghosts and antighosts. Our gauge-fixing procedure allows
for zero-modes, hence is not limited to the acyclic case. We also discuss the
semiclassical approximation and the effective potential for massless modes,
thereby justifying some of our previous constructions in the Batalin-Vilkovisky
approach.
