  It is shown how magnetic fluxbrane, Fp-brane, solutions are related to
electric black p-branes by analytic continuation. Viewing the transverse space
of branes as a warped cone, one finds that the cone base of the p-brane becomes
the world-volume of the F(D-p-3)-brane and the world volume of the p-brane
becomes the cone base of the F(D-p-3)-brane. An explicit example of the
correspondence is given for a 2-brane and F6-brane of 11D supergravity.
