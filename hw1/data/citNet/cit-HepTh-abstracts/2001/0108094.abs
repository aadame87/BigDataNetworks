  Motivated by the possibility that physics may be effectively five-dimensional
over some range of distance scales, we study the possible gaugings of
five-dimensional N=2 supergravity. Using a constructive approach, we derive the
conditions that must be satisfied by the scalar fields in the vector, tensor
and hypermultiplets if a given global symmetry is to be gaugeable. We classify
all those theories that admit the gauging of a compact group that is either
Abelian or semi-simple, or a direct product of a semi-simple and an Abelian
group. In the absence of tensor multiplets, either the gauge group must be
semi-simple or the Abelian part has to be U(1)_R and/or an Abelian isometry of
the hyperscalar manifold. On the other hand, in the presence of tensor
multiplets the gauge group cannot be semi-simple. As an illustrative exercise,
we show how the Standard Model SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1) group may be gauged in
five-dimensional N=2 supergravity. We also show how previous special results
may be recovered within our general formalism.
