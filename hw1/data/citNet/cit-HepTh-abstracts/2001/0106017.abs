Title: The one loop measure in the Group Theoretic approach to String Theory:
  the case of two finite fixed points
Authors: Leonidas Sandoval Jr
Comments: LaTeX2e, 11 pages
\\
  The measure for the one loop scattering of one and $N$ bosonic strings is
calculated using the Group Theoretic approach to String Theory. The calculation
is done for the case when the projective transformation associated with the
loop can be parametrized in terms of two finite fixed points and the
multiplier.
