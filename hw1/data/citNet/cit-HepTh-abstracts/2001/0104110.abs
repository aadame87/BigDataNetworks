  We first derive all world-sheet action functionals for NSR superstring models
with (1,1) supersymmetry and any number of abelian gauge fields, for gauge
transformations of the standard form. Then we prove for these models that the
BRST cohomology groups $H^g(s)$, $g<4$ (with the antifields taken into account)
are isomorphic to those of the corresponding bosonic string models, whose
cohomology is fully known. This implies that the nontrivial global symmetries,
Noether currents, background charges, consistent deformations and candidate
gauge anomalies of an NSR (1,1) superstring model are in one-to-one
correspondence with their bosonic counterparts.
