Title: Gauge-fixing Independence of Test Fields in Yang-Mills Theories
Authors: Sergio M. Iguri and Francisco D. Mazzitelli
Comments: 9 pages, Latex, no figures

  We derive a generalized Nielsen identity for the case of Yang-Mills theories
that include some classical fields. We discuss under which circumstances the
effective action of the classical fields (i.e., after integration of quantum
fields) becomes gauge fixing independent. We conclude that classical test
fields provide a physical insight into the problem of the gauge-fixing
dependence of the quantum effective action.
