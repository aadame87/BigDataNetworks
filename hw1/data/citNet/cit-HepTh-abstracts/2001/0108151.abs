  We discuss an N=2 quantum mechanics with or without a central charge. A
representation is constructed with the number of bosonic degrees of freedom
less that one half of the fermionic degrees of freedom. We suggest a systematic
method of reducing the bosonic degrees of freedom called ``dynamical
reduction."
 Our consideration opens a problem of a general classification of nonstandard
representations of N=2$ superalgebra.
