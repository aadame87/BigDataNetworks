  We demonstrate that the UV/IR mixing problems found recently for a scalar
$\phi^4$ theory on the fuzzy sphere are localized to tadpole diagrams and can
be overcome by a suitable modification of the action. This modification is
equivalent to normal ordering the $\phi^4$ vertex. In the limit of the
commutative sphere, the perturbation theory of this modified action matches
that of the commutative theory.
