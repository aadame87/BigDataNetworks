  Two ways in which de Sitter space can arise in supergravity theories are
discussed. In the first, it arises as a solution of a conventional
supergravity, in which case it necessarily has no Killing spinors. For example,
de Sitter space can arise as a solution of N=8 gauged supergravities in four or
five dimensions. These lift to solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity or D=10
IIB supergravity which are warped products of de Sitter space and non-compact
spaces of negative curvature. In the second way, de Sitter space can arise as a
supersymmetric solution of an unconventional supergravity theory, which
typically has some kinetic terms with the `wrong' sign; such solutions are
invariant under a de Sitter supergroup. Such solutions lift to supersymmetric
solutions of unconventional supergravities in D=10 or D=11, which nonetheless
arise as field theory limits of theories that can be obtained from M-theory by
timelike T-dualities and related dualities. Brane solutions interpolate between
these solutions and flat space and lead to a holographic duality between
theories in de Sitter vacua and Euclidean conformal field theories. Previous
results are reviewed and generalised, and discussion is included of
Kaluza-Klein theory with non-compact internal spaces, brane and cosmological
solutions, and holography on de Sitter spaces and product spaces.
