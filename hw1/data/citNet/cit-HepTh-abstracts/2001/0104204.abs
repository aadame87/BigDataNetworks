  We investigate the enlarged CP(N) model in 2+1 dimensions. This is a hybrid
of two CP(N) models coupled with each other in a dual symmetric fashion, and it
exhibits the gauge symmetry enhancement and radiative induction of the finite
off-diagonal gauge boson mass as in the 1+1 dimensional case. We solve the mass
gap equations and study the fixed point structure in the large-N limit. We find
an interacting ultraviolet fixed point which is in contrast with the 1+1
dimensional case. We also compute the large-N effective gauge action
explicitly.
