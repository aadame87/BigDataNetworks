  When an NS5-brane crosses a D6-brane, a D4-brane is created stretching
between them by the Hanany-Witten effect. However, the T-dual situation
involves a Kaluza-Klein monopole crossing a D5-brane and should not result in
brane creation. Thus, the newly created D4-brane disappears when T-duality is
applied. The T-duality is in a direction transverse to the D4-brane so that one
would naively have expected the creation of a D5-brane in the T-dual picture.
This situation is investigated via the corresponding supergravity solutions and
the tension with the naive result is resolved. Along the way, a differential
form version of the supergravity T-duality relations is developed and some
comments are made concerning the flux-expulsion properties of D6-branes.
