Title: Thermodynamic properties of the quantum vacuum
Authors: M. Scandurra (Pisa U.)
Comments: 15 pages, 1 figure; corrected typos
\\
  An extension of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and of the concept of
entropy to the ground state fluctuations of the quantum fields is studied and
some new results are found. At the end a device to extract energy from the
vacuum recently proposed by an author is critically analyzed. It is found that
no energy can be extracted cyclically from the vacuum.
