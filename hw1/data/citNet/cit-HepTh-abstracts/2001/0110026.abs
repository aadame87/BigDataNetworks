  These introductory notes are about functional renormalization group equations
and some of their applications. It is emphasised that the applicability of this
method extends well beyond critical systems, it actually provides us a general
purpose algorithm to solve strongly coupled quantum field theories. The
renormalization group equation of F. Wegner and A. Houghton is shown to resum
the loop-expansion. Another version, due to J. Polchinski, is obtained by the
method of collective coordinates and can be used for the resummation of the
perturbation series. The genuinely non-perturbative evolution equation is
obtained in a manner reminiscent of the Schwinger-Dyson equations. Two variants
of this scheme are presented where the scale which determines the order of the
successive elimination of the modes is extracted from external and internal
spaces. The renormalization of composite operators is discussed briefly as an
alternative way to arrive at the renormalization group equation. The scaling
laws and fixed points are considered from local and global points of view.
Instability induced renormalization and new scaling laws are shown to occur in
the symmetry broken phase of the scalar theory. The flattening of the effective
potential of a compact variable is demonstrated in case of the sine-Gordon
model. Finally, a manifestly gauge invariant evolution equation is given for
QED.
