  In this paper we try to construct noncommutative Yang-Mills theory for
generic Poisson manifolds. It turns out that the noncommutative differential
calculus defined in an old work is exactly what we need. Using this calculus,
we generalize results about the Seiberg-Witten map, the Dirac-Born-Infeld
action, the matrix model and the open string quantization for constant B field
to non-constant background with H=0.
