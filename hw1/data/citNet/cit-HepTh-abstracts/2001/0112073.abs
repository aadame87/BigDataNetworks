  Classical configurations of a M2-brane, a D2-brane and D0-branes are
investigated in the background of an infinite array of M5-branes or NS5-branes.
On the M2-brane, we discuss three kinds of configurations, such as a sphere, a
cylinder and a torus-like one. These are stabilized by virtue of the background
fluxes of M5-branes. The torus-like M2-brane configuration has winding and
momentum numbers of 11th direction, and in terms of the type IIA superstring
theory, this corresponds to a torus-like D2-brane with electric and magnetic
fluxes on it. We also reproduce the same configuration from a non-abelian
Born-Infeld action for D0-branes. It will be a construction of closed strings
from D0-branes. An electric flux quantization condition on the D2-brane is also
discussed in terms of D0-branes.
