  A physical and geometrical interpretation of previously introduced tensor
operator algebras of U(2,2) in terms of algebras of higher-conformal-spin
quantum fields on the anti-de Sitter space AdS_5 is provided. These are
higher-dimensional W-like algebras and constitute a potential gauge guide
principle towards the formulation of induced conformal gravities
(Wess-Zumino-Witten-like models) in realistic dimensions. Some remarks on
quantum (Moyal) deformations are given and potentially tractable versions of
noncommutative AdS spaces are also sketched. The role of conformal symmetry in
the microscopic description of Unruh and Hawking's radiation effects is
discussed.
