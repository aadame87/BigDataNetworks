  The classical theory of non-relativistic charged particle interacting with
U(1) gauge field is reformulated as the Schr\"odinger wave equation modified by
the de-Broglie-Bohm quantum potential nonlinearity. For, (1 - $\hbar^2$)
deformed strength of quantum potential the model is gauge equivalent to the
standard Schr\"odinger equation with Planck constant $\hbar$, while for the
strength (1 + $\hbar^2$), to the pair of diffusion-anti-diffusion equations.
Specifying the gauge field as Abelian Chern-Simons (CS) one in 2+1 dimensions
interacting with the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger field (the Jackiw-Pi model), we
represent the theory as a planar Madelung fluid, where the Chern-Simons Gauss
law has simple physical meaning of creation the local vorticity for the fluid
flow. For the static flow, when velocity of the center-of-mass motion (the
classical velocity) is equal to the quantum one (generated by quantum potential
velocity of the internal motion), the fluid admits N-vortex solution. Applying
the Auberson-Sabatier type gauge transform to phase of the vortex wave function
we show that deformation parameter $\hbar$, the CS coupling constant and the
quantum potential strength are quantized. Reductions of the model to 1+1
dimensions, leading to modified NLS and DNLS equations with resonance soliton
interactions are discussed.
