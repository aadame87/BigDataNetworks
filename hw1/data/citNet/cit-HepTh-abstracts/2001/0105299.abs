  We propose a vacuum condensate of mass dimension 2 consisting of gluons and
ghosts in the framework of the manifestly covariant gauge fixing of the SU(N)
Yang-Mills theory. This quantity is both BRST and anti-BRST invariant for any
gauge. It includes the ghost condensation $C^a \bar{C}^a$ proposed first in the
modified Maximal Abelian gauge and reduces to the gluon condensates
$(\mathscr{A}_\mu)^2$ of mass dimension 2 proposed recently in the Landau gauge
of the Lorentz gauge fixing. The vacuum condensate of dimensions 2 can provide
the effective mass for gluons and ghosts. The possible existence of such
condensations is demonstrated by calculating the operator product expansion of
the gluon and ghost propagators in both gauges. Its implications to quark
confinement are also discussed in consistent with the previous works.
