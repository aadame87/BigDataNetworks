  We show that the Abelian Higgs field equations in the four dimensional anti
de Sitter spacetime have a vortex line solution. This solution, which has
cylindrical symmetry in AdS$_4$, is a generalization of the flat spacetime
Nielsen-Olesen string. We show that the vortex induces a deficit angle in the
AdS$_4$ spacetime that is proportional to its mass density. Using the AdS/CFT
correspondence, we show that the mass density of the string is uniform and dual
to the discontinuity of a logarithmic derivative of correlation function of the
boundary scalar operator.
