  We clarify a mechanism to obtain a massless gauge boson from the Kaluza-Klein
approach of the Randall-Sundrum(RS) brane world. This corresponds exactly to
the same mechanism of achieving a localization of the gauge boson by adding
both the bulk and brane mass terms. Accordingly this work puts another example
for a localization-mechanism of the gauge boson on the brane.
