  Large extra dimensions provide interesting extensions of our parameter space
for gravitational theories. There exist now brane models which can perfectly
reproduce standard four-dimensional Friedmann cosmology. These models are not
motivated by observations, but they can be helpful in developing new approaches
to the dimensionality problem in string theory.
  I describe the embedding of standard Friedmann cosmology in the DGP model,
and in particular the realization of our current (dust+Lambda)-dominated
universe in this model.
