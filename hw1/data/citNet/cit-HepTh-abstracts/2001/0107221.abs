  A renormalization group flow equation with a scale-dependent transformation
of field variables gives a unified description of fundamental and composite
degrees of freedom. In the context of the effective average action, we study
the renormalization flow of scalar bound states which are formed out of
fundamental fermions. We use the gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at weak gauge
coupling as an example. Thereby, the notions of bound state or fundamental
particle become scale dependent, being classified by the fixed-point structure
of the flow of effective couplings.
