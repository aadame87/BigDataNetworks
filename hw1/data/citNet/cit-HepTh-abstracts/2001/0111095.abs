  Several models in NCG with mild changes to the standard model(SM)are
introduced to discuss the neutrino mass problem. We use two constraints,
Poincar$\acute{e}$ duality and gauge anomaly free, to discuss the possibility
of containing right-handed neutrinos in them. Our work shows that no model in
this paper, with each generation containing a right-handed neutrino, can
satisfy these two constraints in the same time. So, to consist with neutrino
oscillation experiment results, maybe fundamental changes to the present
version of NCG are usually needed to include Dirac massive neutrinos.
