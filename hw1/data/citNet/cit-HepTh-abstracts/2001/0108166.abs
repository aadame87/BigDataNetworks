  The partition function of QCD is analyzed for an arbitrary number of flavors,
N_f, and arbitrary quark masses including the contributions from all
topological sectors in the Leutwyler--Smilga regime. For given N_f and
arbitrary vacuum angle, \theta, the partition function can be reduced to N_f-2
angular integrations of single Bessel functions. For two and three flavors, the
\theta dependence of the QCD vacuum is studied in detail. For N_f= 2 and 3, the
chiral condensate decreases monotonically as \theta increases from zero to \pi
and the chiral condensate develops a cusp at \theta=\pi for degenerate quark
masses in the macroscopic limit. We find a discontinuity at \theta=\pi in the
first derivative of the energy density with respect to \theta for degenerate
quark masses. This corresponds to the first--order phase transition in which CP
is spontaneously broken, known as Dashen's phenomena.
