  We find solutions of the six-dimensional maximal supergravity by adding a
perturbation of vector fields to the solution AdS${}_3$ $\times$ S${}^3$. For
certain perturbations the solution represents a dual description of an ${\cal
N}=(4,0)$ field theory in two dimensions by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
