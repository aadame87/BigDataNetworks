  A new generalization of the Jack polynomials that incorporates fermionic
variables is presented. These Jack superpolynomials are constructed as those
eigenfunctions of the supersymmetric extension of the trigonometric
Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS) model that decomposes triangularly in terms of
the symmetric monomial superfunctions. Many explicit examples are displayed.
Furthermore, various new results have been obtained for the supersymmetric
version of the CMS models: the Lax formulation, the construction of the Dunkl
operators and the explicit expressions for the conserved charges. The
reformulation of the models in terms of the exchange-operator formalism is a
crucial aspect of our analysis.
