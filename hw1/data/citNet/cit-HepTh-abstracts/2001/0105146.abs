  The SU(2) collective coordinates expansion of the Born-Infeld\break Skyrmion
Lagrangian is performed. The classical Hamiltonian is computed from this
special Lagrangian in approximative way: it is derived from the expansion of
this non-polynomial Lagrangian up to second-order variable in the collective
coordinates. This second-class constrained model is quantized by Dirac
Hamiltonian method and symplectic formalism. Although it is not expected to
find symmetries on second-class systems, a hidden symmetry is disclosed by
formulating the Born-Infeld Skyrmion %model as a gauge theory. To this end we
developed a new constraint conversion technique based on the symplectic
formalism. Finally, a discussion on the role played by the hidden symmetry on
the computation of the energy spectrum is presented.
