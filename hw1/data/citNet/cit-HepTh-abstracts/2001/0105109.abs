  In this paper a non-relativistic particle moving on a hypersurface in a
curved space and the multidimensional rotator are investigated using the
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. The equivalence with the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism
is demonstrated in both Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates. The energy
spectrum of the multidimensional rotator is equal to that of a pure
Laplace-Beltrami operator with no additional constant arising from the
curvature of the sphere.
