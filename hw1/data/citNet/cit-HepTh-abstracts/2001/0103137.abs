  A geometric approach to the standard model in terms of the Clifford algebra
Cl_7 is advanced. A key feature of the model is its use of an algebraic spinor
for one generation of leptons and quarks. Spinor transformations separate into
left-sided ("exterior") and right-sided ("interior") types. By definition,
Poincare transformations are exterior ones. We consider all rotations in the
seven-dimensional space that (1) conserve the spacetime components of the
particle and antiparticle currents and (2) do not couple the right-chiral
neutrino. These rotations comprise additional exterior transformations that
commute with the Poincare group and form the group SU(2)_L, interior ones that
constitute SU(3)_C, and a unique group of coupled double-sided rotations with
U(1)_Y symmetry. The spinor mediates a physical coupling of Poincare and
isotopic symmetries within the restrictions of the Coleman--Mandula theorem.
The four extra spacelike dimensions in the model form a basis for the Higgs
isodoublet field, whose symmetry requires the chirality of SU(2). The charge
assignments of both the fundamental fermions and the Higgs boson are produced
exactly.
