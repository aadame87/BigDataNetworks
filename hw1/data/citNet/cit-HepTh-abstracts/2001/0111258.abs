  Topological field theories of Schwarz-type generally admit symmetries whose
algebra does not close off-shell, e.g. the basic symmetries of BF models or
vector supersymmetry of the gauge-fixed action for Chern-Simons theory (this
symmetry being at the origin of the perturbative finiteness of the theory). We
present a detailed discussion of all these symmetries within the algebraic
approach to the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Moreover, we discuss the general
algebraic construction of topological models of both Schwarz- and Witten-type.
