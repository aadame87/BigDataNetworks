  We derive an explicit expression for an associative *-product on fuzzy
complex projective spaces. This generalises previous results for the fuzzy
2-sphere and gives a discrete non-commutative algebra of functions on fuzzy
complex projective spaces, represented by matrix multiplication. The matrices
are restricted to ones whose dimension is that of the totally symmetric
representations of SU(N). In the limit of infinite dimensional matrices we
recover the commutative algebra of functions on ordinary projective space.
Derivatives on the fuzzy projective space are also expressed as matrix
commutators.
