  We study Vafa's geometric transition and Klebanov - Strassler solution from
various points of view in M-theory. In terms of brane configurations, we show
the detailed equivalences between the two models. In some limits, both models
have an alternative realization as fourfolds in M-theory with appropriate
G-fluxes turned on. We discuss some aspects of the fourfolds including how to
see the transition and a possible extension to the non-supersymmetric case.
