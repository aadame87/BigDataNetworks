  We extend the large N duality of four dimensional N=1 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory with additional chiral fields and arbitrary superpotential
recently proposed by Cachazo, Intriligator and Vafa to the case of SO/Sp gauge
groups. By orientifolding the geometric transition, we investigate a large N
duality between N=1, SO/Sp supersymmetric theories with arbitrary
superpotential and an Abelian N=2 theory with supersymmetry broken to N=1 by
electric and magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.
