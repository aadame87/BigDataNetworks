  We construct supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theories
arising when M-theory membranes wrap holomorphic curves in Calabi-Yau n-folds.
The solutions are constructed in an Abelian truncation of maximal D=4 gauged
supergravity and then uplifted to D=11. For four-folds and five-folds we find
new smooth AdS/CFT examples and for all cases we analyse the nature of the
singularities that arise. Our results provide an interpretation of certain
charged topological AdS black holes. We also present the generalised
calibration two-forms for the solutions.
