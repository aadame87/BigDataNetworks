  We investigate bosonic sectors of supersymmetric field theories. We consider
superpotentials described by one and by two real scalar fields, and we show how
the equations of motion can be factorized into a family of first order
Bogomol'nyi equations, so that all the topological defects are of the
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield type. We examine explicit models, that engender
the Z_N symmetry, and we identify all the topological sectors, illustrating
their integrability.
