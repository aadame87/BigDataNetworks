  We concretely define the identity string field as a surface state and deal
with it consistently in terms of conformal field theory language, never using
its formal properties nor oscillator representation of it. The generalized
gluing and resmoothing theorem provides us with a powerful computational tool
which fits into our framework. Among others, we can prove that in some
situations the identity state defined this way actually behaves itself like an
identity element under the *-product. We use these CFT techniques to give an
explicit expression of the classical solution in the ordinary cubic string
field theory having the property that the conjectured vacuum string field
theory action arises when the cubic action is expanded around it.
