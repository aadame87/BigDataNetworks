Title: Tubular Field Theory

  We propose tubular field theory, which is a continuum analogue of lattice
field theory. One-dimensional links (and zero-dimensional sites) in lattice
field theory are replaced by two-dimensional tubes to result in two-dimensional
spacetime microscopically. As an example, scalar and gauge fields are
considered in `three-dimensional' tubular spacetime.
