  We show that the matrix formulation of non-commutative field theories is
equivalent, in the continuum, to a formulation in a mixed
configuration-momentum space. In this formulation, the non-locality of the
interactions, that leads to the IR/UV mixing, becomes transparent. We clarify
the relation between long range effects (and IR divergences) and the
non-planarity of the corresponding Feynman diagrams.
