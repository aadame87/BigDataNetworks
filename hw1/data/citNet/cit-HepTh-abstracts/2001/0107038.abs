Title: S-duality for 2-d gravity
Authors: J. A. Nieto
Comments: 15 pages, Latex

  We investigate the analogue of S-duality for 2-d gravity. Our analysis is
based in a partition function associated to the Katanaev-Volovich type action
for 2-d gravity. We find a S-dual 2-d gravitational action which is related to
the original 2-d gravitational action by strong-weak duality transformation.
