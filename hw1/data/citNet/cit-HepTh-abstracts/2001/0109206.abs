  In this paper the linear representations of analytic Moufang loops are
investigated. We prove that every representation of semisimple analytic Moufang
loop is completely reducible and find all nonassociative irreducible
representations. We show that such representations are closely associated with
the (anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills equations in ${\bf R}^8$
