  One of the key ingredients of A. Connes' noncommutative geometry is a
generalized Dirac operator which induces a metric(Connes' distance) on the
state space. We generalize such a Dirac operator devised by A. Dimakis et al,
whose Connes' distance recovers the linear distance on a 1D lattice, into 2D
lattice. This Dirac operator being "naturally" defined has the so-called "local
eigenvalue property" and induces Euclidean distance on this 2D lattice. This
kind of Dirac operator can be generalized into any higher dimensional lattices.
