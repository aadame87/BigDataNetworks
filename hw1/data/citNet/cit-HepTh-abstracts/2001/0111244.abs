  The current status of bounds on and limits of fermion determinants in two,
three and four dimensions in QED and QCD is reviewed. A new lower bound on the
two-dimensional QED determinant is derived. An outline of the demonstration of
the continuity of this determinant at zero mass when the background magnetic
field flux is zero is also given.
