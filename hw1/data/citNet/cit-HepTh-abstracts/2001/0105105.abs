  It is shown how to map the quantum states of a system of free scalar
particles one-to-one onto the states of a completely deterministic model. It is
a classical field theory with a large (global) gauge group. The mapping is now
also applied to free Maxwell fields. Lorentz invariance is demonstrated.
