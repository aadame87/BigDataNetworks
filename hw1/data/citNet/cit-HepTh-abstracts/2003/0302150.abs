  We extend the results of Cachazo, Seiberg and Witten to N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theories with gauge groups SO(2N), SO(2N+1) and Sp(2N). By taking the
superpotential which is an arbitrary polynomial of adjoint matter \Phi as a
small perturbation of N=2 gauge theories, we examine the singular points
preserving N=1 supersymmetry in the moduli space where mutually local monopoles
become massless. We derive the matrix model complex curve for the whole range
of the degree of perturbed superpotential. Then we determine a generalized
Konishi anomaly equation implying the orientifold contribution. We turn to the
multiplication map and the confinement index K and describe both Coulomb branch
and confining branch. In particular, we construct a multiplication map from
SO(2N+1) to SO(2KN-K+2) where K is an even integer as well as a multiplication
map from SO(2N) to SO(2KN-2K+2) (K is a positive integer), a map from SO(2N+1)
to SO(2KN-K+2) (K is an odd integer) and a map from Sp(2N) to Sp(2KN+2K-2).
Finally we analyze some examples which show some duality: the same moduli space
has two different semiclassical limits corresponding to distinct gauge groups.
