  When calculating higher terms of the epsilon-expansion of massive Feynman
diagrams, one needs to evaluate particular cases of multiple inverse binomial
sums. These sums are related to the derivatives of certain hypergeometric
functions with respect to their parameters. We explore this connection and
analytically calculate a number of such infinite sums, for an arbitrary value
of the argument which corresponds to an arbitrary value of the off-shell
external momentum. In such a way, we find a number of new results for
physically important two-loop two- and three-point Feynman diagrams. The
results are presented in terms of generalized polylogarithmic functions.
