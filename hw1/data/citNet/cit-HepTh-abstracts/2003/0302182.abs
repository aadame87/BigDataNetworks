Title: Tachyon Condensation and Universal Solutions in String Field Theory

  We investigate a non-perturbative vacuum in open string field theory expanded
around the analytic classical solution which has been found in the universal
Fock space generated by matter Virasoro generators and ghost oscillators. We
carry out level-truncation analyses up to level (6,18) in the theory around
one-parameter families of the solution. We observe that the value of the vacuum
energy approaches the D-brane tension as the approximation level is increased,
but this non-perturbative vacuum disappears at the boundary of the parameter
space. These results provide strong evidence for the conjecture that, although
the universal solutions are pure gauge in almost all the parameter space, they
are regarded as the tachyon vacuum solution at the boundary.
