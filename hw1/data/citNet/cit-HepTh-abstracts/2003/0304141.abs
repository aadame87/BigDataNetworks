Title: Consistent noncommutative quantum gauge theories?
Authors: A.A.Slavnov
Comments: 10 pages, no figures, LaTex
\\
  A new noncommutative model invariant with respect to U(1) gauge group is
proposed. The model is free of nonintegrable infrared singularities. Its
commutative classical limit describes a free scalar field. Generalization to
U(N) models is also considered.
