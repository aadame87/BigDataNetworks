Title: Renormalization of Yang-Mills fields in the light-front without
  non-local terms
Authors: Alfredo Takashi Suzuki
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  The study of renormalization of Yang-Mills fields in the light-front gauge
has always been a delicate subject in that divergent {\em non-local} terms
arise from the calculations of Feynman diagrams. In this short paper we show
that this happened because of a deficiency in the gauge fixing procedure that
results in an incorrect propagator and propose a cure for it by considering the
{\em correct} propagator for the gauge potential. We explicitly show that the
use of our correct propagator in the light-front leads to a vacuum polarization
tensor at the one-loop level that is free of non-local terms.
