Title: Energy Density of Vortices in the Schroedinger Picture

  The one-loop energy density of an infinitely thin static magnetic vortex in
SU(2) Yang-Mills theory is evaluated using the Schroedinger picture. Both the
gluonic fluctuations as well as the quarks in the vortex background are
included. The energy density of the magnetic vortex is discussed as a function
of the magnetic flux. The center vortices correspond to local minima in the
effective potential. These minima are degenerated with the perturbative vacuum
if the fermions are ignored. Inclusion of fermions lifts this degeneracy,
raising the vortex energy above the energy of the perturbative vacuum.
