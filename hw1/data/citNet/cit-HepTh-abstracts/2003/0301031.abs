  We present a cosmological model in 1+m+p dimensions, where in m-dimensional
space there are uniformly distributed p-branes wrapping over the extra
p-dimensions. We find that during cosmological evolution m-dimensional space
expands with the exact power-law corresponding to pressureless matter while the
extra p-dimensions contract. Adding matter, we also obtain solutions having the
same property. We show that this might explain in a natural way why the extra
dimensions are small compared to the observed three spatial directions.
