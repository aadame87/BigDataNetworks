  The \gamma-trace anomaly of supersymmetry current in a supersymmetric gauge
theory shares a superconformal anomaly multiplet with the chiral R-symmetry
anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, and its holographic reproduction is a valuable
test to the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture. We investigate how the
\gamma-trace anomaly of the supersymmetry current of N=1 four-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theory in an N=1 conformal supergravity background can be
extracted out from the N=2$ gauged supergravity in five dimensions. It is shown
that the reproduction of this super-Weyl anomaly originates from the following
two facts: First the N=2 bulk supersymmetry transformation converts into N=1
superconformal transformation on the boundary, which consists of N=1
supersymmetry transformation and special conformal supersymmetry (or
super-Weyl) transformation; second the supersymmetry variation of the bulk
action of five-dimensional gauged supergravity is a total derivative. The
non-compatibility of supersymmetry and the super-Weyl transformation invariance
yields the holographic supersymmetry current anomaly. Furthermore, we speculate
on that the contribution from the external gauge field to the holographic
superconformal anomaly is dominated by the leading terms in the asymptotic
expansion of the bulk fields in terms of the radial coordinate, while external
gravitational background contribution is determined by those terms with
logarithmic function dependence on the radial coordinate.
