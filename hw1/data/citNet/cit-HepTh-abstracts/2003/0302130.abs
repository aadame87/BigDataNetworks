  We examine the gauge generating nature of the translational subgroup of
Wigner's little group for the case of massless tensor gauge theories and show
that the gauge transformations generated by the translational group is only a
subset of the complete set of gauge transformations. We also show that, just
like the case of topologically massive gauge theories, translational groups act
as generators of gauge transformations in gauge theories obtained by extending
massive gauge noninvariant theories by a Stuckelberg mechanism. The
representations of the translational groups that generate gauge transformations
in such Stuckelberg extended theories can be obtained by the method of
dimensional descent. We illustrate these with the examples of Stuckelberg
extended first class versions of Proca, Einstein-Pauli-Fierz and massive
Kalb-Ramond theories in 3+1 dimensions. A detailed analysis of the partial
gauge generation in massive and massless 2nd rank symmetric gauge theories is
provided. The gauge transformations generated by translational group in 2-form
gauge theories are shown to explicitly manifest the reducibility of gauge
transformations in these theories.
