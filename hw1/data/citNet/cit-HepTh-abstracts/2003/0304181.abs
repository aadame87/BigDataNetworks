Title: Black holes in Godel universes and pp-waves
Authors: Eric G. Gimon and Akikazu Hashimoto
Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure

  We find exact rotating and non-rotating neutral black hole solutions in the
Godel universe of the five dimensional minimal supergravity theory. We also
describe the embedding of this solution in M-theory. After dimensional
reduction and T-duality, we obtain a supergravity solution corresponding to
placing a black string in a pp-wave background.
