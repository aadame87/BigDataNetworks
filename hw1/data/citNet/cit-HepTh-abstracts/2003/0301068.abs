  We present a simple group representation analysis of massive, and
particularly ``partially massless'', fields of arbitrary spin in de Sitter
spaces of any dimension. The method uses bulk to boundary propagators to relate
these fields to Euclidean conformal ones at one dimension lower. These results
are then used to revisit an old question: can a consistent de Sitter
supergravity be constructed, at least within its intrinsic horizon?
