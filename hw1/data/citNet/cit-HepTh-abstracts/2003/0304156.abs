Title: N=1 Super QCD and Fractional Branes
Authors: Franco Pezzella
Comments: 4 pages, LaTeX. Talk given at the IXth International Symposium on
  Particles, Strings and Cosmology PASCOS '03, Mumbai-India, January 3-8 2003.
  To appear in a special issue of Pramana
\\
  We show how to get the one-loop beta function and the chiral anomaly of N=1
Super QCD from a stack of fractional N D3-branes localized inside the
world-volume of 2M fractional D7-branes on the orbifold C^3/(Z_2 x Z_2). They
are obtained by analyzing the classical supergravity background generated by
such a brane configuration, in the spirit of the gauge/gravity correspondence.
