  We investigate intersecting D6-branes on an orientifold of type IIA theory in
the orbifold background T^6/(Z_4 x Z_2) with the emphasis on finding chiral
spectra. RR tadpole cancellation conditions and the scalar potential at disc
level are computed. The general chiral spectrum is displayed, and two
supersymmetric models with a Pati-Salam group are shown,one with four
generations and the other one with three generations and exactly the chiral
matter content of the SM plus right handed neutrinos.
