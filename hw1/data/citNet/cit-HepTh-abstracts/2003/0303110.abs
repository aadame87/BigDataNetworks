  In this paper, we analyze the anisotropy of the scale factor in the
Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. We show that the anisotropy will not increase when
the expansion rate is greater than certain values while it will increase when
the expansion rate is less than that value or the Universe is contracting. It
is manifested that the matter dominated and radiation dominated era favor the
flat spacetime if the anisotropy does not develop significantly. The relation
between the cosmological anisotropy and the red-shift of the supernovae, which
could be used to verify the anisotropy through the observation, has been
derived.
