  We derive the Konishi anomaly equations for N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories
based on the classical gauge groups with matter in two-index tensor and
fundamental representations, thus extending the existing results for U(N). A
general formula is obtained which expresses solutions to the Konishi anomaly
equation in terms of solutions to the loop equations of the corresponding
matrix model. This provides an alternative to the diagrammatic proof that the
perturbative part of the glueball superpotential $W_{\rm eff}$ for these matter
representations can be computed from matrix model integrals, and further shows
that the two approaches always give the same result. The anomaly approach is
found to be computationally more efficient in the cases we studied. Also, we
show in the anomaly approach how theories with a traceless two-index tensor can
be solved using an associated theory with a traceful tensor and appropriately
chosen coupling constants.
