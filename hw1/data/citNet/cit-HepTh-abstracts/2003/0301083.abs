Title: osp(1|32) and Extensions of super-AdS_5 X S^5 algebra
Authors: Kiyoshi Kamimura and Makoto Sakaguchi

  The super-AdS_5 X S^5 and the four-dimensional N=4 superconformal algebras
play important roles in superstring theories. It is often discussed the roles
of the osp(1|32) algebra as a maximal extension of the superalgebras in flat
background. In this paper we show that the su(2,2|4), the super-AdS_5 X S^5
algebra or the superconformal algebra, is not a restriction of the osp(1|32)
though the bosonic part of the former is a subgroup of the latter. There exist
only two types of u(1) extension of the super-AdS_5 X S^5 algebra if the
bosonic AdS_5 X S^5 covariance is imposed. Possible significance of the results
is also discussed briefly.
