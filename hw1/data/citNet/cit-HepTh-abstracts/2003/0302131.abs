  The relationship between on-shell tree level scattering amplitudes of open
and closed strings, discovered some time ago by Kawai, Lewellen and Tye, is
used at field theory level (at $O(\alpha'^3)$) to establish a link between the
general relativity and the non-abelian Yang-Mills effective actions. Insisting
at the effective Lagrangian level that any tree $N$ point gravity on-shell
scattering amplitude is directly factorisable into a sum of $N$ point
left-right products of non-abelian Yang-Mills tree on-shell scattering
amplitudes, non-trivial mappings of the effective general relativity operators
into the effective non-abelian Yang-Mills operators are derived. Implications
of such mapping relations of the field operators are discussed.
