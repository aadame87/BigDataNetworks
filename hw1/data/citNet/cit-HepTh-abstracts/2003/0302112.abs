Title: Hamilton-Jacobi quantization of a free particle on a $(n-1)$-sphere
Authors: Soon-Tae Hong, Klaus D. Rothe

\\
  We study a free particle on a $(n-1)$-sphere in an extended phase space,
where the originally second-class Hamiltonian and constraints are now in strong
involution. This allows for a Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the model, and
enables us to quantize the system canonically and to obtain the free particle
energy spectrum corresponding to that of a rigid rotator.
