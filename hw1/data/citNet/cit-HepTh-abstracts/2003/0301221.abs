  We give an overview of D-branes in the maximally supersymmetric plane wave
background of IIB supergravity. We start by reviewing the results of the probe
analysis. We then present the open string analysis and show how certain
spacetime symmetries are restored using worldsheet symmetries. We discuss the
construction of these branes as boundary states and summarize what is known
about the dual gauge theory description.
