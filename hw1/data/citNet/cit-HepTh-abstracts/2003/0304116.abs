  The quantum statistical mechanics of generally covariant systems --particles,
strings and membranes-- on noncommutative field spaces is studied. We discuss
how to introduce non-local communication among different systems via
noncommutativity. This idea is applied to cosmology where we argue that due to
the breaking of relativistic invariance one can consider a privileged reference
system where many universes interact as a quantum gas in a reservoir. If
roughly speaking, we approximate the universes as tensionless membranes, then,
the interaction among universes provided by noncommutativity is harmonic. The
oscillation frequency for each universe is proportional to $B/M$, where $B$ is
the noncommutativity parameter --that we identify as the primordial magnetic
field, {\it i.e.} $\sim 10^{-16} {GeV}^2$- and $M$ is the mass of the universe
($\sim 10^{77} {GeV}$) and, therefore each universe have the pulsation
frequency $\omega \sim 10^{-68} s^{-1}$.
