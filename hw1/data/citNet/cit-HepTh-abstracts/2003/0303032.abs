  We use the matrix model -- gauge theory correspondence of Dijkgraaf and Vafa
in order to construct the geometry encoding the exact gaugino condensate
superpotential for the N=1 U(N) gauge theory with adjoint and symmetric or
anti-symmetric matter, broken by a tree level superpotential to a product
subgroup involving U(N_i) and SO(N_i) or Sp(N_i/2) factors. The relevant
geometry is encoded by a non-hyperelliptic Riemann surface, which we extract
from the exact loop equations. We also show that O(1/N) corrections can be
extracted from a logarithmic deformation of this surface. The loop equations
contain explicitly subleading terms of order 1/N, which encode information of
string theory on an orientifolded local quiver geometry.
