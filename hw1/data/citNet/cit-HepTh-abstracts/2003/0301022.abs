Title: On the low-energy limit of the QED N-photon amplitudes
Authors: Louise C. Martin, Christian Schubert, Victor M. Villanueva Sandoval

  We derive an explicit formula for the low energy limits of the one-loop,
on-shell, N-photon amplitudes, for arbitrary N and all helicity assignments, in
scalar and spinor QED. The two-loop corrections to the same amplitudes are
obtained for up to the ten point case. All photon amplitudes with an odd number
of `+' helicities are shown to vanish in this limit to all loop orders.
