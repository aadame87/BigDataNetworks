  In this paper we consider a charged massless scalar quantum field operator in
the spacetime of an idealized cosmic string, i.e., an infinitely long, straight
and static cosmic string, which presents a magnetic field confined in a
cylindrical tube of finite radius. Three distinct situations are taking into
account in this analysis: {\it{i)}} a homogeneous field inside the tube,
{\it{ii)}} a magnetic field proportional to $1/r$ and {\it{iii)}} a cylindrical
shell with $\delta$-function. In these three cases the axis of the infinitely
long tube of radius $R$ coincides with the cosmic string. In order to study the
vacuum polarization effects outside the tube, we explicitly calculate the
Euclidean Green function associated with this system for the three above
situations, considering points in the region outside the tube.
