Title: Three-dimensional black hole entropy
Authors: Jan Troost and Asato Tsuchiya
Comments: 20 pages, 2 figures; v2: error corrected, conclusions changed

  We discuss in detail the properties of gravity with a negative cosmological
constant as viewed in Cherns-Simons theory on a line times a disc. We reanalyze
the problem of computing the BTZ entropy, and show how the demand of unitarity
and modular invariance of the boundary conformal field theory severely
constrain proposals in this framework.
