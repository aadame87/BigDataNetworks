Title: Quantum Extended Supersymmetries
Authors: Dan Radu Grigore, Gunter Scharf
Comments: 28 pages, LATEX 2e
\\
  We analyse some quantum multiplets associated with extended supersymmetries.
We study in detail the general form of the causal (anti)commutation relations.
The condition of positivity of the scalar product imposes severe restrictions
on the (quantum) model. It is problematic if one can find out quantum
extensions of the standard model with extended supersymmetries.
