  The three dimensional nonlinear sigma model is unrenormalizable in
perturbative method. By using the $\beta$ function in the nonperturbative
Wilsonian renormalization group method, we argue that ${\cal N}=2$
supersymmetric nonlinear $\sigma$ models are renormalizable in three
dimensions. When the target space is an Einstein-K\"{a}hler manifold with
positive scalar curvature, such as C$P^N$ or $Q^N$, there are nontrivial
ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, which can be used to define the nontrivial
continuum theory. If the target space has a negative scalar curvature, however,
the theory has only the infrared Gaussian fixed point, and the sensible
continuum theory cannot be defined. We also construct a model which
interpolates between the C$P^N$ and $Q^N$ models with two coupling constants.
This model has two non-trivial UV fixed points which can be used to define the
continuum theory. Finally, we construct a class of conformal field theories
with ${\bf SU}(N)$ symmetry, defined at the fixed point of the nonperturbative
$\beta$ function. These conformal field theories have a free parameter
corresponding to the anomalous dimension of the scalar fields. If we choose a
specific value of the parameter, we recover the conformal field theory defined
at the UV fixed point of C$P^N$ model and the symmetry is enhanced to ${\bf
SU}(N+1)$.
