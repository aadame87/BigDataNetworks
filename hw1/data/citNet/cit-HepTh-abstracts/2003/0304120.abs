  Boundary integrable models with N=2 supersymmetry are considered. For the
simplest boundary N=2 superconformal minimal model with a Chebyshev bulk
perturbation we show explicitly how fermionic boundary degrees of freedom arise
naturally in the boundary perturbation in order to maintain integrability and
N=2 supersymmetry. A new boundary reflection matrix is obtained for this model
and N=2 boundary superalgebra is studied. A factorized scattering theory is
proposed for a N=2 supersymmetric extension of the boundary sine-Gordon model
with either (i) fermionic or (ii) bosonic and fermionic boundary degrees of
freedom. Exact results are obtained for some quantum impurity problems: the
boundary scaling Lee-Yang model, a massive deformation of the anisotropic Kondo
model at the filling values g=2/(2n+3) and the boundary Ashkin-Teller model.
