Title: Correspondence between the 3-point BMN correlators and the 3-string
  vertex on the pp-wave

  The PP-wave/SYM proposal in its original form emphasizes a duality relation
between the masses of the string states and the anomalous dimensions of the
corresponding BMN operators in gauge theory, the mass--dimension type duality.
In this paper, we give evidence in favour of another duality relation of the
vertex--correlator type, which relates the coefficients of 3-point correlators
of BMN operators in gauge theory to 3-string vertices in lightcone string field
theory in the pp-wave background. We verify that all the available field theory
results in the literature, as well as the newly obtained ones, for the 3-point
functions are successfully reproduced from our proposal.
