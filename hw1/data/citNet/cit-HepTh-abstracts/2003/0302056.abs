  We review some recent results concerning the quantitative analysis of the
universality classes of two-dimensional statistical models near their critical
point. We also discuss the exact calculation of the two--point correlation
functions of disorder operators in a free theory of complex bosonic and
fermionic field, correlators ruled by a Painleve differential equation.
