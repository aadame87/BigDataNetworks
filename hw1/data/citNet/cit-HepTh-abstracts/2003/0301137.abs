  We derive equations of motion for the tachyon field living on an unstable
non-BPS D-brane in the level truncated open cubic superstring field theory in
the first non-trivial approximation. We construct a special time dependent
solution to this equation which describes the rolling tachyon. It starts from
the perturbative vacuum and approaches one of stable vacua in infinite time. We
investigate conserved energy functional and show that its different parts
dominate in different stages of the evolution. We show that the pressure for
this solution has its minimum at zero time and goes to minus energy at infinite
time.
