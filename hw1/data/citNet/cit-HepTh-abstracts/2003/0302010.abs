Title: Target Space Approach to Closed String Tachyons

  We use the low energy effective theory of string theory to investigate
condensations of closed string tachyons propagating in the bulk. The c-function
is related to the total energy of the system via the effective action. A
possible modification of the c-theorem is discussed. We also deduce endpoints
of the decays by investigating scalar potential of gauged supergravities. A
string theory in the flat spacetime would be a possible endpoint.
