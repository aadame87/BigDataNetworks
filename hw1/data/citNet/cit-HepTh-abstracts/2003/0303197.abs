  Type IIA Orientifolds

  We present new classes of supersymmetric Standard-like models from type IIA
$\IT^6/(\IZ_2\times \IZ_2)$ orientifold with intersecting D6-branes. D6-branes
can wrap general supersymmetric three-cycles of $\IT^6=\IT^2\times \IT^2\times
\IT^2$, and any $\IT^2$ is allowed to be tilted. The models still suffer from
additional exotics, however we obtained solutions with fewer Higgs doublets, as
well as models with all three families of left-handed quarks and leptons
arising from the same intersecting sector, and examples of a genuine left-right
symmetric model with three copies of left-handed and right-handed families of
quarks and leptons.
