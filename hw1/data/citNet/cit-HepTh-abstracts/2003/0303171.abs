  In certain Lorentz-covariant higher-derivative field theories of spins < or
=1, would-be ultraviolet divergences generate color-singlet poles as infrared
divergences. Absence of higher-order poles implies ten-dimensional
supersymmetric Yang-Mills with bound-state supergravity, in close analogy with
open string theory.
