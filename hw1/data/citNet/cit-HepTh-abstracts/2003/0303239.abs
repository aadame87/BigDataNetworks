  We show that the on-shell S-matrix elements of four open string massless
scalars, two scalars and two tachyons, and four open string tachyons in the
super string theory can be written in a unique form. We then propose an
off-shell extension for the S-matrix element of four scalars which is
consistent, in the low energy limit, with the Dirac-Born-Infeld effective
action. Using a similar off-shell extension for the S-matrix element of two
scalars and two tachyons and for the S-matrix element of four tachyons, we show
that they are fully consistent with the tachyonic DBI action.
