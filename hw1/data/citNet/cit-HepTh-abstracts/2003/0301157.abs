  In [1] (hep-th/0211069), the author has discussed the quantum parameter space
of the N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with one adjoint Higgs field Phi, tree-level
superpotential W_tree = m (Phi^2)/2 + g (Phi^3)/3$, and gauge group U(Nc). In
particular, full details were worked out for U(2) and U(3). By discussing
higher rank gauge groups like U(4), for which the classical parameter space has
a large number of disconnected components, we show that the phenomena discussed
in [1] are generic. It turns out that the quantum space is connected. The
classical components are related in the quantum theory either through standard
singularities with massless monopoles or by branch cuts without going through
any singularity. The branching points associated with the branch cuts
correspond to new strong coupling singularities, which are not associated with
vanishing cycles in the geometry, and at which glueballs can become massless.
The transitions discussed recently by Cachazo, Seiberg and Witten are special
instances of those phenomena.
