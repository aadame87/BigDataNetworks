  Turning on background fields in string theory sometimes has an alternative
interpretation as a deformation of the target space geometry. A particularly
well-known case is the NS-NS two form B, which gives rise to space-time
non-commutativity. In this note we point out that this phenomenon extends to
ten-dimensional superspace when employing a covariant quantization of the
superstring, generalizing an observation by Ooguri and Vafa in four dimensions.
In particular, we will find that RR field strengths give rise to a non-zero
$\{\theta,\theta\}$ anti-commutator, just as in four dimensions, whereas the
gravitino yields a non-zero value for $[x,\theta]$.
