  We study parity symmetries and crosscap states in classes of N=2
supersymmetric quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions, including non-linear
sigma models, gauged WZW models, Landau-Ginzburg models, and linear sigma
models. The parity anomaly and its cancellation play important roles in many of
them. The case of the N=2 minimal model are studied in complete detail, from
all three realizations -- gauged WZW model, abstract RCFT, and LG models. We
also identify mirror pairs of orientifolds, extending the correspondence
between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry by including unorientable
worldsheets. Through the analysis in various models and comparison in the
overlapping regimes, we obtain a global picture of orientifolds and D-branes.
