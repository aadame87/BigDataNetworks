  We develop a perturbative approach to the solution of the scalar wave
equation for a large AdS black hole. In three dimensions, our method coincides
with the known exact solution. We discuss the five-dimensional case in detail
and apply our procedure to the Heun equation. We calculate the quasi-normal
modes analytically and obtain good agreement with numerical results for the
low-lying frequencies.
