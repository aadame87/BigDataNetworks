  We outline the construction of metastable de Sitter vacua of type IIB string
theory. Our starting point is highly warped IIB compactifications with
nontrivial NS and RR three-form fluxes. By incorporating known corrections to
the superpotential from Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation,
one can make models with all moduli fixed, yielding a supersymmetric AdS
vacuum. Inclusion of a small number of anti-D3 branes in the resulting warped
geometry allows one to uplift the AdS minimum and make it a metastable de
Sitter ground state. The lifetime of our metastable de Sitter vacua is much
greater than the cosmological timescale of 10^10 years. We also prove, under
certain conditions, that the lifetime of dS space in string theory will always
be shorter than the recurrence time.
