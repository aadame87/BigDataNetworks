Title: Holographic dimensional reduction from entanglement in Minkowski space

  We present evidence that dimensional reduction in Minkowksi space is induced
by quantum entanglement. First, we show that correlation functions of a class
of operators restricted to a sub-volume of D-dimensional Minkowski space scale
as its surface area. A simple example of such area scaling is provided by the
energy fluctuations of a free massless quantum field in its vacuum state. This
is reminiscent of area scaling of entropy of entanglement but applies to
quantum expectation values in a pure state, rather than to statistical averages
over a mixed state. We then show, in specific cases, that the bulk theory in
the sub-volume has a holographic representation in terms of a boundary theory
at high temperature.
