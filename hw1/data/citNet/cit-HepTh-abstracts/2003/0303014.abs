Title: Abelianization of Constraints in SU(N) Yang-Mills Theory
Authors: F. Loran
\\
  The abelian form of the first class constraints of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in
$D=3+1$ is obtained explicitly. Considering the abelian constraints, it is
shown that Coulomb gauge does not lead to Gribov copies. We also show that in
the strong coupling limit, the gauge symmetry of the theory is similar to that
of QED.
