  The infinite matrices in Witten's vertex are easy to diagonalize. It just
requires some SL(2,R) lore plus a Watson-Sommerfeld transformation. We
calculate the eigenvalues of all Neumann matrices for all scale dimensions s,
both for matter and ghosts, including fractional s which we use to regulate the
difficult s=0 limit. We find that s=1 eigenfunctions just acquire a p term, and
x gets replaced by the midpoint position.
