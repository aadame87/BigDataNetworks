  We construct a classical mechanics Hamiltonian which exhibits spontaneous
symmetry breaking akin the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, dimensional
transmutation, and asymptotically free self-similarity congruent with the
beta-function of four dimensional Yang-Mills theory. Its classical equations of
motion support stable periodic orbits and in a three dimensional projection
these orbits are self-linked into topologically nontrivial, toroidal knots.
