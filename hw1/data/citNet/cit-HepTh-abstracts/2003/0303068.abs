  Newton potential has been evaluated for the case of dS brane embedded in
Minkowski, dS$_5$ and AdS$_5$ bulks. We point out that only the AdS$_5$ bulk
might be consistent with the Newton's law from the brane-world viewpoint when
we respect a small cosmological constant observed at present universe.
