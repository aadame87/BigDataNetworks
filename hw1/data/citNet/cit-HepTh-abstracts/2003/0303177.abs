  Using functional derivatives with respect to the free correlation function we
derive a closed set of Schwinger-Dyson equations in phi^4-theory. Its
conversion to graphical recursion relations allows us to systematically
generate all connected and one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams for the
two- and four-point function together with their weights.
