  In our previous papers, we prove the no-ghost theorem without light-cone
directions (hep-th/0005002, hep-th/0303051). We point out that our results are
valid for more general backgrounds. In particular, we prove the no-ghost
theorem for AdS_3 in the context of the BRST quantization (with the standard
restriction on the spin). We compare our BRST proof with the OCQ proof and
establish the BRST-OCQ equivalence for AdS_3. The key in both approaches lies
in the certain structure of the matter Hilbert space as a product of two Verma
modules. We also present the no-ghost theorem in the most general form.
