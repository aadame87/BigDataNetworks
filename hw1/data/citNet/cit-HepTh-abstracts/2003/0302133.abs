Title: Particle Spectrum of the Supersymmetric Standard Model from the Massless
  Excitations of a Four Dimensional Superstring
Authors: B. B. Deo and L. Maharana
\\
  A superstring action is quantised with Neveu Schwarz(NS) and Ramond(R)
boundary conditions. The zero mass states of the NS sector are classified as
the vector gluons, W-mesons, $B_{\mu}$-mesons and scalars containing Higgs. The
fifteen zero mass fermions are obtained from the Ramond sector. A space time
supersymmetric Hamiltonian of the Standard Model is presented without any
conventional SUSY particles.
