  We compute the emission of closed string radiation from homogeneous rolling
tachyons. For an unstable decaying D$p$-brane the radiated energy is infinite
to leading order for $p\leq 2$ and finite for $p>2$. The closed string state
produced by a decaying brane is closely related to the state produced by
D-instantons at a critical Euclidean distance from $t=0$. In the case of a D0
brane one can cutoff this divergence so that we get a finite energy final state
which would be the state that the brane decays into.
