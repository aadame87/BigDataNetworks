Title: Lectures on D-branes, tachyon condensation, and string field theory

  quantum gravity, Valdivia, Chile, January 2002

  These lectures provide an introduction to the subject of tachyon condensation
in the open bosonic string. The problem of tachyon condensation is first
described in the context of the low-energy Yang-Mills description of a system
of multiple D-branes, and then using the language of string field theory. An
introduction is given to Witten's cubic open bosonic string field theory. The
Sen conjectures on tachyon condensation in open bosonic string field theory are
introduced, and evidence confirming these conjectures is reviewed.
