Title: Knotlike Cosmic Strings in The Early Universe
Authors: Yi-shi Duan and Xin Liu
\\
  In this paper, the knotlike cosmic strings in the early universe are
discussed. We derive the cosmic string structures from the non-zero torsion
tensor, and reveal that these strings are just created from the zero points of
complex scalar quintessence field. In these strings we mainly study the
knotlike configurations, and have constructed a new topological invariant for
them. It is also shown that this invariant is just the total sum of all the
self-linking and all the linking numbers of the knotlike strings family, and
that this invariant is preserved in the branch processes during the evolution
of cosmic strings.
