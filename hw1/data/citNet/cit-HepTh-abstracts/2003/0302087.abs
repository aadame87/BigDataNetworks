  We extend the method of calculation of propagators in maximally symmetric
spaces (Minkowski, dS, AdS and their Euclidean versions) in terms of intrinsic
geometric objects to the case of massive spin 3/2 field. We obtain the
propagator for arbitrary space-time dimension and mass in terms of Heun's
function, which is a generalization of the hypergeometric function appearing in
the case of other spins. As an application of this result we calculate the
conformal dimension of the dual operator in the recently proposed dS/CFT
correspondence both for spin 3/2 and for spin 1/2. We find that, in agreement
with the expectation from analytic continuation from AdS, the conformal
dimension of the dual operator is {\it always} complex (i.e. it is complex for
every space-time dimension and value of the mass parameter). We comment on the
implications of this result for fermions in dS/CFT.
