  Electromagnetic plane waves provide examples of time-dependent open string
backgrounds free of $\alpha'$ corrections. The solvable case of open strings in
a quadrupolar wave front, analogous to pp-waves for closed strings, is
discussed. In light-cone gauge, it leads to non-conformal boundary conditions
similar to those induced by tachyon condensates. A maximum electric gradient is
found, at which macroscopic strings with vanishing tension are pair-produced --
a non-relativistic analogue of the Born-Infeld critical electric field. Kinetic
instabilities of quadrupolar electric fields are cured by standard atomic
physics techniques, and do not interfere with the former dynamic instability. A
new example of non-conformal open-closed duality is found. Propagation of open
strings in time-dependent wave fronts is discussed.
