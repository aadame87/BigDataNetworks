  We consider warped compactifications that solve the 10 dimensional
supergravity equations of motion at a point, stabilize the position of a
D3-brane world, and admit a warp factor that violates Lorentz invariance along
the brane. This gives a string embedding of ``asymmetrically warped'' models
which we use to calculate stringy (\alpha') corrections to standard model
dispersion relations, paying attention to the maximum speeds for different
particles. We find, from the dispersion relations, limits on gravitational
Lorentz violation in these models, improving on current limits on the speed of
graviton propagation, including those derived from field theoretic loops. We
comment on the viability of models that use asymmetric warping for self-tuning
of the brane cosmological constant.
