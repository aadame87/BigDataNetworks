Title: Zero-norm States and Reduction of Stringy Scattering Amplitudes

  We give a systematic method to generate two types of zero-norm states in the
old covariant first quantized (OCFQ) spectrum of open bosonic string. Zero-norm
states up to the fourth massive level and general formulas of some zero-norm
tensor states at an arbitrary mass level are calculated. On-shell Ward
identities generated by zero-norm states can then be used to express the
stringy scattering amplitudes of the degenerate lower spin propagating states
in terms of those of higher spin propagating states at each fixed mass level.
This decoupling phenomenon is, in contrast to Gross's high-energy symmetries,
valid to \QTR{em}{all} energy. As examples, we explicitly demonstrate this
stringy phenomenon up to the fourth massive level (spin-five), which justifies
the calculation of two other previous approaches based on the massive
worldsheet sigma-model and Witten's string field theory (WSFT).
