  Arbitrary Impurities

  We study string interactions among string states with arbitrary impurities in
the Type IIB plane wave background using string field theory. We reproduce all
string amplitudes from gauge theory by computing matrix elements of the
dilatation operator in a previously proposed basis of states. A direct
correspondence is found between the string field theory and gauge theory
Feynman diagrams.
