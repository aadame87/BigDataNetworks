  The light-front quantization of gauge theories in light-cone gauge provides a
frame-independent wavefunction representation of relativistic bound states,
simple forms for current matrix elements, explicit unitary, and a trivial
vacuum. The light-front Hamiltonian form of QCD provides an alternative to
lattice gauge theory for the computation of nonperturbative quantities such as
the hadronic spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions. In the case of the
electroweak theory, spontaneous symmetry breaking is represented by the
appearance of zero modes of the Higgs field. Light-front quantization then
leads to an elegant ghost-free theory of massive gauge particles, automatically
incorporating the Lorentz and 't Hooft conditions, as well as the Goldstone
boson equivalence theorem.
