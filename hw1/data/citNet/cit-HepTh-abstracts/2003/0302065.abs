Title: On the definition of velocity in theories with two observer-independent
  scales
Authors: S. Mignemi
Comments: 6 pages, plain LaTeX
\\
  We argue that a consistent definition of the velocity of a particle in
generalizations of special relativity with two observer-independent scales
should be independent from the mass of the particle. This request rules out the
definition $v_i=\partial p_0/\partial p_i$, but allows for other definitions
proposed in the literature.
