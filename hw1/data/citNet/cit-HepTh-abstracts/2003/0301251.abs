Title: On the SuperConformal Quantum Mechanics in the Nonlinear Realizations
  Approach
Authors: V.P. Akulov, Oktay Cebecioglu and A. Pashnev
\\
  In the framework of nonlinear realizations we rederive the action of the N=2
SuperConformal Quantum Mechanics (SCQM). We propose also the WZNW -- like
construction of the interaction term in the lagrangian with the help of
Cartan's Omega forms.
