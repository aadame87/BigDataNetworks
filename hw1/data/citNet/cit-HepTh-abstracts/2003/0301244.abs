  The nonlinear realization of conformal so(2,d) symmetry for relativistic
systems and the dynamical conformal so(2,1) symmetry of nonrelativistic systems
are investigated in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that the
massless particle in d-dimensional Minkowski space can be treated as the system
confined to the border of the AdS_{d+1} of infinite radius, while various
nonrelativistic systems may be canonically related to a relativistic (massless,
massive, or tachyon) particle on the AdS_2 X S^{d-1}. The list of
nonrelativistic systems "unified" by such a correspondence comprises the
conformal mechanics model, the planar charge-vortex and 3-dimensional
charge-monopole systems, the particle in a planar gravitational field of a
point massive source, and the conformal model associated with the charged
particle propagating near the horizon of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black
hole.
