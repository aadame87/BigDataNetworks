  Assuming spherical symmetry we analyse the dynamics of an inhomogeneous dark
radiation vaccum on a Randall and Sundrum 3-brane world. Under certain natural
conditions we show that the effective Einstein equations on the brane form a
closed system. On a de Sitter brane and for negative dark energy density we
determine exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions which depend on the brane
cosmological constant, on the dark radiation tidal charge and on its initial
configuration. We also identify the conditions leading to the formation of a
singularity or of regular bounces inside the dark radiation vaccum.
