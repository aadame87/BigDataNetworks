  We discuss the k dependence of the k-string tension sigma_k in SU(N)
supersymmetric gluodynamics. As well known, at large N the k-string consists,
to leading order, of k noninteracting fundamental strings, so that sigma_k=k
sigma_1. We argue, both from field-theory and string-theory side, that
subleading corrections to this formula run in powers of 1/N^2 rather than 1/N,
thus excluding the Casimir scaling. We suggest a heuristic model allowing one
to relate the k-string tension in four-dimensional gluodynamics with the
tension of the BPS domain walls (k-walls). In this model the domain walls are
made of a net of strings connected to each other by baryon vertices. The
relation emerging in this way leads to the sine formula sigma_ k ~ Lambda^2 N
sin pi k/N. We discuss possible corrections to the sine law, and present
arguments that they are suppressed by 1/k factors. We explain why the sine law
does not hold in two dimensions. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the
sine formula for non-supersymmetric orientifold field theories.
