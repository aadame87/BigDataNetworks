  We find a new class of time-dependent brane solutions in supergravities in
arbitrary dimensions $D$. These are general intersecting light-like branes
(null-branes), and their superposition and intersection rules are obtained.
This is achieved by directly solving bosonic field equations for supergravity
coupled to a dilaton and antisymmetric tensor fields. We discuss their possible
significance.
