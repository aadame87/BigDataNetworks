  We consider a deformation of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four
dimensions, which we call the C-deformation, where the gluino field satisfies a
Clifford-like algebra dictated by a self-dual two-form, instead of the standard
Grassmannian algebra. The superpotential of the deformed gauge theory is
computed by the full partition function of an associated matrix model (or more
generally a bosonic gauge theory), including non-planar diagrams. In this
identification, the strength of the two-form controls the genus expansion of
the matrix model partition function. For the case of pure N=1 Yang-Mills this
deformation leads to the identification of the all genus partition function of
c=1 non-critical bosonic string at self-dual radius as the glueball
superpotential. Though the C-deformation violates Lorentz invariance, the
deformed F-terms are Lorentz invariant and the Lorentz violation is screened in
the IR.
