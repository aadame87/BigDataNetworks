  Traditional derivations of the Planck mass ignore the role of charge and spin
in general relativity. From the Kerr-Newman null surface and horizon radii,
quantized charge and spin dependence are introduced in an extended Planck scale
of mass. Spectra emerge with selection rules dependent upon the choice of
Kerr-Newman radius to link with the Compton wavelength. The appearance of the
fine structure constant suggests the possibility of a variation in time of the
extended Planck mass, which may be much larger than the variation in the
traditional one. There is a suggestion of a connection with the $\alpha$ value
governing high-energy radiation in Z-boson production and decay.
