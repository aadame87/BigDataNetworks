  We investigate the charges and fluxes that can occur in higher-order Abelian
gauge theories defined on compact space-time manifolds with boundary. The
boundary is necessary to supply a destination to the electric lines of force
emanating from brane sources, thus allowing non-zero net electric charges, but
it also introduces new types of electric and magnetic flux. The resulting
structure of currents, charges, and fluxes is studied and expressed in the
language of relative homology and de Rham cohomology and the corresponding
abelian groups. These can be organised in terms of a pair of exact sequences
related by the Poincar\'e-Lefschetz isomorphism and by a weaker flip symmetry
exchanging the ends of the sequences. It is shown how all this structure is
brought into play by the imposition of the appropriately generalised Maxwell's
equations. The requirement that these equations be integrable restricts the
world-volume of a permitted brane (assumed closed) to be homologous to a cycle
on the boundary of space-time. All electric charges and magnetic fluxes are
quantised and satisfy the Dirac quantisation condition. But through some
boundary cycles there may be unquantised electric fluxes associated with
quantised magnetic fluxes and so dyonic in nature.
