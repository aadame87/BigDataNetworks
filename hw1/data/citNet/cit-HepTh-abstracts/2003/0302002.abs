  The Heisenberg, interaction, and Schr\"odinger pictures of motion are
considered in Lagrangian (canonical) quantum field theory. The equations of
motion (for state vectors and field operators) are derived for arbitrary
Lagrangians which are polynomial or convergent power series in field operators
and their first derivatives. The general links between different time-dependent
pictures of motion are derived. It is pointed that all of them admit covariant
formulation, similar to the one of interaction picture. A new picture, called
the momentum picture, is proposed. It is a 4-dimensional analogue of the
Schr\"odinger picture of quantum mechanics as in it the state vectors are
spacetime-dependent, while the field operators are constant relative to the
spacetime. The equations of motion in momentum picture are derived and
partially discussed. In particular, the ones for the field operators turn to be
of algebraic type. The general idea of covariant pictures of motion is
presented. The equations of motion in these pictures are derived.
