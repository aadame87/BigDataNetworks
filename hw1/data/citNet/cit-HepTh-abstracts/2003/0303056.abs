  New algebraic approach to analytical calculations of D-dimensional integrals
for multi-loop Feynman diagrams is proposed. We show that the known analytical
methods of evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals, such as integration by
parts and star-triangle relation methods, can be drastically simplified by
using this algebraic approach. To demonstrate the advantages of the algebraic
method of analytical evaluation of multi-loop Feynman diagrams, we calculate
ladder diagrams for the massless $\phi^3$ theory. Using our algebraic approach
we show that the problem of evaluation of special classes of Feynman diagrams
reduces to the calculation of the Green functions for specific quantum
mechanical problems. In particular, the integrals for ladder massless diagrams
in the $\phi^3$ scalar field theory are given by the Green function for the
conformal quantum mechanics.
