  We have covariantized the Lagrangians of the U(1)_V * U(1)_A models, which
have U(1)_V * U(1)_A gauge symmetry in two dimensions, and studied their
symmetric structures. The special property of the U(1)_V * U(1)_A models is the
fact that all these models have an extra time coordinate in the target
space-time. The U(1)_V * U(1)_A models coupled to two-dimensional gravity are
string models in 26+2 dimensional target space-time for bosonic string and in
10+2 dimensional target space-time for superstring. Both string models have two
time coordinates. In order to construct the covariant Lagrangians of the U(1)_V
* U(1)_A models the generalized Chern-Simons term plays an important role. The
supersymmetric generalized Chern-Simons action is also proposed. The
Green-Schwarz type of U(1)_V * U(1)_A superstring model has another fermionic
local symmetry as well as \kappa-symmetry. The supersymmetry of target
space-time is different from the standard one.
