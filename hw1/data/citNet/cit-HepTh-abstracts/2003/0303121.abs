  We determine ${\cal N}=4$ partition functions of ${\cal N}=4$ super
Yang-Mills gauge theory for some $ADE$ gauge groups on $K3$, under the
assumption that they are holomorphic. Our partition functions satisfy the gap
condition and Montonen-Olive duality at the same time, like the SU(N) partition
functions of Vafa and Witten. As a result we find a close relation between
Hecke operator and $S$-duality of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills for $ADE$ gauge
group on $K3$.
