  String representations of the SU(N)-version of compact QED in three and four
dimensions are constructed. Using for concreteness the three-dimensional case,
it is demonstrated how the resulting SU(N)-generalization of the so-called
theory of confining strings can be obtained in various ways. Such an
SU(N)-theory of confining strings is then compared with the approach to the
derivation of the string tension of the Wilson loop defined at the flat
contour. This approach is based on the evaluation of the mean magnetic field
inside the contour. In the SU(N)-version of the four-dimensional compact QED
with the $\theta$-term, the critical values of the $\theta$-parameter, at which
the problem of crumpling of large world sheets might be solved, are found.
These values are only accessible provided the electric coupling constant is
larger than a certain N-dependent quantity. This parallels the fact that
confinement in the four-dimensional compact QED holds in the strong-coupling
regime.
