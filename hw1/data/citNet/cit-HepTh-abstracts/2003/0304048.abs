  We present a phase-space analysis of cosmology containing multiple scalar
fields with positive and negative exponential potentials. In addition to the
well-known assisted inflationary solutions, there exits power-law
multi-kinetic-potential scaling solutions for sufficiently flat positive
potentials or steep negative potentials, which are the unique late-time
attractor whenever they exist. We briefly discuss the physical consequences of
these results.
