  We complete the construction of the Moyal star formulation of bosonic open
string field theory (MSFT) by providing a detailed study of the fermionic ghost
sector. In particular, as in the case of the matter sector, (1) we construct a
map from Witten's star product to the Moyal product, (2) we propose a
regularization scheme which is consistent with the matter sector and (3) as a
check of the formalism, we derive the ghost Neumann coefficients algebraically
directly from the Moyal product. The latter satisfy the Gross-Jevicki nonlinear
relations even in the presence of the regulator, and when the regulator is
removed they coincide numerically with the expression derived from conformal
field theory. After this basic construction, we derive a regularized action of
string field theory in the Siegel gauge and define the Feynman rules. We give
explicitly the analytic expression of the off-shell four point function for
tachyons, including the ghost contribution. Some of the results in this paper
have already been used in our previous publications. This paper provides the
technical details of the computations which were omitted there.
