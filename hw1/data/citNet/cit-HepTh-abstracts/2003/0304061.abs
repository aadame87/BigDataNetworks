  We consider four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge
group U(N) on R^3 x S^1, in the presence of a classical superpotential. The
low-energy quantum superpotential is obtained by simply replacing the adjoint
scalar superfield in the classical superpotential by the Lax matrix of the
integrable system that underlies the 4d field theory. We verify in a number of
examples that the vacuum structure obtained in this way matches precisely that
in 4d, although the degrees of freedom that appear are quite distinct. Several
features of 4d field theories, such as the possibility of lifting vacua from
U(N) to U(tN), become particularly simple in this framework. It turns out that
supersymmetric vacua give rise to a reduction of the integrable system which
contains information about the field theory but also about the Dijkgraaf-Vafa
matrix model. The relation between the matrix model and the quantum
superpotential on R^3 x S^1 appears to involve a novel kind of mirror symmetry.
