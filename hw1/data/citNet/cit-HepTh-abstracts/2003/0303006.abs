  Minkowski space can be sliced, outside the lightcone, in terms of Euclidean
Anti-de Sitter and Lorentzian de Sitter slices. In this paper we investigate
what happens when we apply holography to each slice separately. This yields a
dual description living on two spheres, which can be interpreted as the
boundary of the light cone. The infinite number of slices gives rise to a
continuum family of operators on the two spheres for each separate bulk field.
For a free field we explain how the Green's function and (trivial) S-matrix in
Minkowski space can be reconstructed in terms of two-point functions of some
putative conformal field theory on the two spheres. Based on this we propose a
Minkowski/CFT correspondence which can also be applied to interacting fields.
We comment on the interpretation of the conformal symmetry of the CFT, and on
generalizations to curved space.
