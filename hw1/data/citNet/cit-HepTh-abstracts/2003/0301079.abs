  We study a family of kinetic operators in string field theory describing the
theory around the closed string vacuum. Those operators are based on the
analytical classical solutions of Takahashi and Tanimoto and are analogous to
the pure ghost action usually referred to as "vacuum string field theory," but
are much more general, and less singular than the pure ghost operator. The
closed string vacuum is related to the D-brane vacuum by large, singular, gauge
transformations or field redefinition, and all those different representations
are related to each other by small gauge transformations. We try to clarify the
nature of this singular gauge transformation. We also show that by choosing the
Siegel gauge one recovers the propagator proposed in hep-th/0207266 that
generates closed string surfaces.
