Title: 3d Conformal Higher Spin Symmetry in 2+1 Dimensional Matter Systems
Authors: O.V. Shaynkman
Comments: Report given at III Sakharov Conference on Physics in Moscow; 8 pages
\\
  The symmetry algebra of massless fields living on the 3-dimensional conformal
boundary of AdS(4) is shown to be isomorphic to 3d conformal higher spin
algebra (AdS(4) higher spin algebra). A simple realization of this algebra on
the free flat 3d massless matter fields is given in terms of an auxiliary Fock
module.
