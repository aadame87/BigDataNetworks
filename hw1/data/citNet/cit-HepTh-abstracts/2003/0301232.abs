  We consider compactification of the SO(32) heterotic string on a
6-dimensional Z_3 orbifold with one discrete Wilson line. A complete set of all
possible embeddings is given. The unbroken subgroups of SO(32) are tabulated.
The extended gauge symmetry SU(3)^3, recently discussed by J. E. Kim
[hep-th/0301177] for semi-realistic E_8 x E_8 heterotic string models, occurs
for several embeddings, as well as other groups that may be of interest in
unified string models. The extent to which extra gauge group factors can be
hidden is discussed and compared to the E_8 x E_8 case. Along flat directions
where an effective hidden sector exists, the embeddings described here provide
for hidden gauge groups that are not possible in the E_8 x E_8 heterotic
string.
