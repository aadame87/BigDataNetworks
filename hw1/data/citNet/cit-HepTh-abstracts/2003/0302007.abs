Title: Stability Issues for w < -1 Dark Energy
Author: Paul H. Frampton

  Global fits to precision cosmological data which show that there is a dark
energy component comprising about 2/3 of the total cosmological energy also
hint that a dark energy with $w = P/\rho < -1$ is viable, even favored. Here we
discuss implications of such a surprising $w$, including whether it jeopardizes
vacuum stability. It appears to be secure in microscopic processes, but why
bulk dark energy has not decayed spontaneously is mysterious.
