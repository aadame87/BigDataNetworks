  We consider a toy metric in four dimensional space-time defined in terms of a
recursive hierarchical prescription. The matter distribution turns out to be
extremely inhomogeneous. Surprisingly, for very large samples the average mass
density tends (very slowly) to a constant. There is no trace of fractal
dimension left.
