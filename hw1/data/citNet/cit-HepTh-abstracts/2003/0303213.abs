  Recently, gauged supergravities in three dimensions with Yang-Mills and
Chern-Simons type interactions have been constructed. In this article, we
demonstrate that any gauging of Yang-Mills type with semisimple gauge group
G_0, possibly including extra couplings to massive Chern-Simons vectors, is
equivalent on-shell to a pure Chern-Simons type gauging with non-semisimple
gauge group $G_0 \ltimes T \subset G$, where T is a certain translation group,
and where G is the maximal global symmetry group of the ungauged theory. We
discuss several examples.
