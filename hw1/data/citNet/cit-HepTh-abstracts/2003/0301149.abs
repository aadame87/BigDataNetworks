  We treat the two-dimensional projection of the (2+1) BTZ black hole (known as
Achucarro-Ortiz black hole or as (1+1) dilatonic black hole) as a Casimir-type
system. The stress tensor of a massless scalar field satisfying Dirichlet
boundary conditions on two one-dimensional ``walls'' (``Dirichlet walls'') is
explicitly calculated in three different vacua. Without employing known
regularization techniques, the expression in each vacuum for the stress tensor
is reached by using the Wald's axioms. Finally, within this asymptotically
non-flat gravitational background, it is shown that the stability of the
configuration, obtained by setting Casimir force to zero, is controlled by the
cosmological constant.
