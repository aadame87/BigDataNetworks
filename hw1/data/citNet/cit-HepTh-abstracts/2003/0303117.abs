  We consider deSitter universe and Nariai universe induced by quantum CFT with
classical phantom matter and perfect fluid. The model represents the
combination of trace-anomaly driven inflation and phantom driven deSitter
universe. The similarity of phantom matter with quantum CFT indicates that
phantom scalar may be the effective description for some quantum field theory.
It is demonstrated that it is easier to achieve the acceleration of the scale
factor preserving the energy conditions in such unified model. Some properties
of unified theory (anti-gravitating solutions, negative ADM mass Nariai
solution, relation with steady state) are briefly mentioned.
