  By using the hybrid formalism, superstrings in four-dimensional NS-NS plane
waves are studied in a manifest supersymmetric manner. This description of the
superstring is obtained by a field redefinition of the RNS worldsheet fields
and defined as a topological N=4 string theory. The Hilbert space consists of
two types of representations describing short and long strings. We study the
physical spectrum to find boson-fermion asymmetry in the massless spectrum of
the short string. Some massive spectrum of the short string and the massless
spectrum of the long string are also studied.
