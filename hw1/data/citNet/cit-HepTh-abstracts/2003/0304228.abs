  The construction of dual theories for linearized gravity in four dimensions
is considered. Our approach is based on the parent Lagrangian method previously
developed for the massive spin-two case, but now considered for the zero mass
case. This leads to a dual theory described in terms of a rank two symmetric
tensor, analogous to the usual gravitational field, and an auxiliary
antisymmetric field. This theory has an enlarged gauge symmetry, but with an
adequate partial gauge fixing it can be reduced to a gauge symmetry similar to
the standard one of linearized gravitation. We present examples illustrating
the general procedure and the physical interpretation of the dual fields. The
zero mass case of the massive theory dual to the massive spin-two theory is
also examined, but we show that it only contains a spin-zero excitation.
