  We try to explain a possible relation between the Holography principle in
physics (namely the assertion that the quantum theory of gravity on a manifold
with boundary should coincide with the conformal field theory on the boundary)
and the Deligne conjecture in mathematics which states that the Hochschild
complex of an associative algebra is an algebra over the little 2-discs operad
(equivalently it has a natural 2-algebra structure).
