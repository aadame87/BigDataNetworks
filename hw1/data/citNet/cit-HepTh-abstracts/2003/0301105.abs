  In this paper we analyse the non-hyperelliptic Seiberg-Witten curves derived
from M-theory that encode the low energy solution of N=2 supersymmetric
theories with product gauge groups. We consider the case of a SU(N_1)xSU(N_2)
gauge theory with a hypermultiplet in the bifundamental representation together
with matter in the fundamental representations of SU(N_1) and SU(N_2). By means
of the Riemann bilinear relations that hold on the Riemann surface defined by
the Seiberg--Witten curve, we compute the logarithmic derivative of the
prepotential with respect to the quantum scales of both gauge groups. As an
application we develop a method to compute recursively the instanton
corrections to the prepotential in a straightforward way. We present explicit
formulas for up to third order on both quantum scales. Furthermore, we extend
those results to SU(N) gauge theories with a matter hypermultiplet in the
symmetric and antisymmetric representation. We also present some non-trivial
checks of our results.
