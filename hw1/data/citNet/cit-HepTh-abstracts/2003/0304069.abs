  We look at some dynamic geometries produced by scalar fields with both the
"right" and the "wrong" sign of the kinetic energy. We start with anisotropic
homogeneous universes with closed, open and flat spatial sections. A
non-singular solution to the Einstein field equations representing an open
anisotropic universe with the ghost field is found. This universe starts
collapsing from $t \to -\infty$ and then expands to $t \to \infty$ without
encountering singularities on its way. We further generalize these solutions to
those describing inhomogeneous evolution of the ghost fields. Some interesting
solutions with the plane symmetry are discussed. These have a property that the
same line element solves the Einstein field equations in two mirror regions
$|t|\geq z$ and $|t|\leq z$, but in one region the solution has the
\emph{right} and in the other, the \emph{wrong} signs of the kinetic energy. We
argue, however, that a physical observer can not reach the mirror region in a
finite proper time. Self-similar collapse/expansion of these fields are also
briefly discussed.
