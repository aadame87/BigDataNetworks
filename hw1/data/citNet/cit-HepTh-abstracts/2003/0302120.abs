  We survey noncommutative spacetimes with coordinates being enveloping
algebras of Lie algebras. We also explain how to do differential geometry on
noncommutative spaces that are obtained from commutative ones via a
Moyal-product type cocycle twist, such as the noncommutative torus,
$\theta$-spaces and Clifford algebras. The latter are noncommutative
deformations of the finite lattice $(Z_2)^n$ and we compute their
noncommutative de Rham cohomology and moduli of solutions of Maxwell's
equations. We exactly quantize noncommutative U(1)-Yang-Mills theory on
$Z_2\times Z_2$ in a path integral approach.
