Title: Proper fluctuations associated with quantum tunneling in field theory
Authors: Michael Maziashvili
Comments: Latex, 4 pages, 1 figure
\\
  It is shown that, to the lowest order in $\hbar,$ the particle production
related to the tunneling that leads to the false vacuum decay is described by
the orthogonal part of fluctuation field with respect to the bounce solution.
