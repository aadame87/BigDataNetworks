  All purely bosonic supersymmetric solutions of minimal gauged supergravity in
five dimensions are classified. The solutions fall into two classes depending
on whether the Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is time-like
or null. When it is timelike, the solutions are determined by a
four-dimensional Kahler base-manifold, up to an anti-holomorphic function, and
generically preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetry. When it is null we provide a
precise prescription for constructing the solutions and we show that they
generically preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry. We show that AdS_5 is the unique
maximally supersymmetric configuration. The formalism is used to construct some
new solutions, including a non-singular deformation of AdS_5, which can be
uplifted to obtain new solutions of type IIB supergravity.
