  The large-group behavior of the nonlocal YM$_2$'s and gYM$_2$'s on a cylinder
or a disk is investigated. It is shown that this behavior is similar to that of
the corresponding local theory, but with the area of the cylinder replaced by
an effective area depending on the dominant representation. The critical areas
for nonlocal YM$_2$'s on a cylinder with some special bounary conditions are
also obtained.
