Title: Comment on `A simple explanation of the non-appearance of physical
  gluons and quarks'
Authors: Andreas Aste (University of Basel)

  In a recent paper by Johan Hansson [hep-ph/0208137] it is claimed that the
non-appearance of quarks and gluons as physical particles is an automatic
result of the nonabelian nature of the color interaction in quantum
chromodynamics. It is shown that the arguments given by Hansson are
insufficient to support his claim by giving simple counter arguments.
