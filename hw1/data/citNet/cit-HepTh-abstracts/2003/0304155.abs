Title: Exact String-like Solutions of the Gauged Nonlinear O(3) Model
Authors: H.R. Vanaie and N. Riazi
Comments: 7 pages, 5 figures
\\
  We show that the least energy conditions in the gauged nonlinear sigma model
with Chern-Simons term lead to exact soliton-like solutions which have the same
features as domain walls. We will derive and discuss the corresponding
solutions, and compute the total energy, charge, and spin of the resulting
system.
