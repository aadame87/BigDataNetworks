Title: Optimal Renormalization-Group Improvement of R(s) via the Method of
  Characteristics

  We discuss the application of the method of characteristics to the
renormalization-group equation for the perturbative QCD series within the
electron-positron annihilation cross-section. We demonstrate how one such
renormalization-group improvement of this series is equivalent to a closed-form
summation of the first four towers of renormalization-group accessible
logarithms to all orders of perturbation theory.
