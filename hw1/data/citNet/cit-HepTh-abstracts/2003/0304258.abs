Title: Supersymmetric $G^3$ Unification from Intersecting D6-Branes on Type IIA
  Orientifolds

  We propose three supersymmetric $G^3$ models with $S_3$ symmetry and minimal
stacks of D6-branes from the intersecting D6-branes on Type IIA orientifolds.
In those models, the RR tadpole can be cancelled and the 4-dimensional N=1
supersymmetry is preserved elegantly. Phenomenologically, there exists the
gauge coupling unification, the Standard Model fermions and Higgs doublets can
be embedded into the bifundamental representations, but there are no symmetric
or anti-symmetric representations. Especially in Model I where the gauge group
is $U(4)^3$, we just have three famililes of fermions and three pairs of Higgs
particles. We also show that the $G^3$ gauge symmetry can be broken down to the
Standard Model gauge symmetry by introducing the light open string states.
