  We study ${\cal N}=2$ $SO(2N+1)$ SYM theory in the context of matrix model.
Byyadding a superpotential of the scalar multiplet, $W(\Phi)$, of degree
$2N+2$, we reduce the theory to ${\cal N}=1$. The $2N+1$ distinct critical
points of $W(\Phi)$ allow us to choose a vacuum in such a way to break the
gauge group to its maximal abelian subgroup. We compute the free energy of the
corresponding matrix model in the planar limit and up to two vertices. This
result is then used to work out the effective superpotential of ${\cal N}=1$
theory up to one-instanton correction. At the final step, by scaling the
superpotential to zero, the effective U(1) couplings and the prepotential of
the ${\cal N}=2$ theory is calculated which are in accord with the previous
results.
