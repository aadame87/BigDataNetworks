  We give an explicit formulation of the time dependent AdS/CFT correspondence
when there are multiple vacua present in Lorentzian signature. By computing
sample two point functions we show how different amplitudes are related by
cosmological particle production. We illustrate our methods in two example
spacetimes: (a) a ``bubble of nothing'' in AdS space, and (b) an asymptotically
locally AdS spacetime with a bubble of nothing on the boundary. In both cases
the alpha vacua of de Sitter space make an interesting appearance.
