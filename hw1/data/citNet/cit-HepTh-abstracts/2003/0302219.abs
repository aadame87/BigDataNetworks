Title: The Anthropic Landscape of String Theory
Authors: Leonard Susskind
Comments: 21 pages, 5 figures
\\
  In this lecture I make some educated guesses, about the landscape of string
theory vacua. Based on the recent work of a number of authors, it seems
plausible that the lanscape is unimaginably large and diverse. Whether we like
it or not, this is the kind of behavior that gives credence to the Anthropic
Principle. I discuss the theoretical and conceptual issues that arise in
developing a cosmology based on the diversity of environments implicit in
string theory.
