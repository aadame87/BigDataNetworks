Title: Bouncing pre-big bang on the brane
Authors: Stefano Foffa
Comments: 15 pages, 3 figures
\\
  A regular bouncing universe is obtained in the context of a dilaton-gravity
brane world scenario. The scale factor starts in a contracting inflationary
phase both in the Einstein and in the string frame, it then undergoes a bounce
(due to interaction with the bulk Weyl tensor), and subsequently enters into a
decelerated expanding era. This graceful exit is obtained at low curvature and
low coupling, and without violating the Null Energy Condition.
