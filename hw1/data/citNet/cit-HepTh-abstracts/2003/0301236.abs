Title: Dualisation of the General Scalar Coset in Supergravity Theories
Authors: N.T.Yilmaz
Comments: 22 pages
\\
  The dualised formulation of the symmetric space sigma model is peformed for a
general scalar coset G/K where G is a maximally non-compact group and K it's
maximal compact subgroup.By using the twisted self-duality condition the
general form of the first-order equations are obtained.The results are applied
to the example of SL(2,R)/SO(2) scalar manifold of the IIB supergravity.
