Title: Another Leigh-Strassler deformation through the Matrix model
Authors: Teresia Mansson
Comments: 15 pages,2 figures
\\
  In here the matrix model approach, by Dijkgraaf and Vafa, is used in order to
obtain the effective superpotential for a certain deformation of N=4 SYM
discovered by Leigh and Strassler. An exact solution to the matrix model
Lagrangian is found and is expressed in terms of elliptic functions.
