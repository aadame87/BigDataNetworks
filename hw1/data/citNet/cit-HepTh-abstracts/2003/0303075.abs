  A geometric treatment of T-duality as an operation which acts on differential
forms in superspace allows us to derive the complete set of T-duality
transformation rules which relate the superfield potentials of D=10 type IIA
supergravity with those of type IIB supergravity including Ramond-Ramond
superfield potentials and fermionic supervielbeins. We show that these rules
are consistent with the superspace supergravity constraints.
