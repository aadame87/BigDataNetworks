  For a quantum mechanical system with broken supersymmetry, it is demonstrated
that reformulation of the problem as that of a (1+1)-D Dirac equation allows an
easy determination of the ground state if the corresponding energy eigenvalue
is sufficiently small. A simple expression is derived for the approximate
ground state energy in an associated, well-separated, asymmetric
double-well-type potential. Our discussion is also relevant for the analysis of
the fermion bound state in the kink-antikink scalar background.
