  By treating the bulk-quantized Yang-Mills theory as a constrained system we
obtain a consistent gauge-fixed BRST hamiltonian in the minimal sector. This
provides an independent derivation of the 5-d lagrangian bulk action. The
ground state is independent of the (anti)ghosts and is interpreted as the
solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, thus establishing a direct connection
to the Fokker-Planck hamiltonian. The vacuum state correlators are shown to be
in agreement with correlators in lagrangian 5-d formulation. It is verified
that the complete propagators remain parabolic in one-loop dimensional
regularization.
