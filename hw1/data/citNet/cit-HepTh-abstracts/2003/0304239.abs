  We consider the thermal properties of IIA string theory on the pp-wave which
comes from the circle compactification of the maximally supersymmetric eleven
dimensional pp-wave. The one-loop free energy is computed and Hagedorn
temperature is found as a function of the RR-flux $\mu$. In the $\mu \to
\infty$ limit, the free energy is shown to be identical with that of IIB string
theory on maximally supersymmetric pp-wave. We use two complementary
approaches, operator and path integral methods. Several points, including the
zero point energy and the modular properties of the free energy, are more
illuminating and transparent in the path integral method. We find the complete
agreement between those two approaches in the free energy expression and the
dependency of the Hagedorn temperature on the RR-flux.
