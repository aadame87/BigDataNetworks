  The spectrum of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the background of crossing vortices
is studied. To exploit the index theorem, and in analogy to the lattice the
space-time manifold is chosen to be the four-torus T^4. For sake of simplicity
we consider two idealized cases: infinitely fat and infinitely thin
transversally intersecting vortices. The time-dependent spectrum of the Dirac
Hamiltonian is calculated and in particular the influence of the vortex
crossing on the quark spectrum is investigated.
