  In this paper, we show that the propagator of the dual of a general
Proca-like theory, derived from the gauging iterative Noether Dualization
Method, can be written by means of a simple relation between known propagators.
This result is also a demonstration that the Lagrangian obtained by dualization
describes the same physical particles as the ones present in the original
theory at the expense of introducing new non-physical (ghosts) excitations.
