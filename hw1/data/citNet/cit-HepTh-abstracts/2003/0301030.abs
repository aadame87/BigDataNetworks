  The one-loop contribution to vacuum polarization is calculated for the
adjoint fermions in three dimensional noncommutative spaces, both at zero and
finite temperature. At zero temperature, we confirm a previously found result
for the parity odd part and subsequently analyze the even parity part, which
exhibits UV/IR mixing. We discuss in detail, two regimes of the high
temperature behavior of the parity odd part. When the thermal wavelength is
much smaller, as compared to the noncommutativity scale, we find an interesting
Fermi-Bose transmutation in the nonplanar part.
