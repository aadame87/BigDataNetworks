  We point out that the worldvolume coordinate functions $x^\mu(\xi)$ of a
p-brane interacting with dynamical gravity are Goldstone fields for spacetime
diffeomorphisms gauge symmetry. The presence of this gauge invariance is
exhibited by its associated Noether identity, which expresses that the source
equations follow from the gravitational equations. We discuss the spacetime
counterpart of the Higgs effect and show that a p-brane does not carry any
local degrees of freedom, extending early known general relativity features.
Our considerations are also relevant for brane world scenarios.
