Title: Superpartner States in Quantum Mechanics of Colored Particle
Authors: Sh. Mamedov
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Superpartner correspondence of states of colored particle in external
chromomagnetic field given by non-commuting constant vector potentials is
determined. Squared Dirac equation for this particle is solved exactly and
explicit expressions of superpartner states are found. The wave functions of
states with definite energy are found. Supersymmetry algebra and superpartner
states in three dimensional motion case are considered.
