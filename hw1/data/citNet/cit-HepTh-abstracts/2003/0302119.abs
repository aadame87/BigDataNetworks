\\
  The response of the one loop effective action for a gauge theory with local
couplings $g(x),\theta(x)$ under a local Weyl rescaling of the background
metric is calculated. Apart from terms which may be removed by local
contributions to the effective action the result is compatible with $Sl(2,R)$
symmetry acting on $g,\theta$. Two loop effects are also discussed.
