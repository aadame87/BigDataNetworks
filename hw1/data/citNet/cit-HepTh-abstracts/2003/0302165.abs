  We show how the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model proposal can be extended to
describe five-dimensional gauge theories compactified on a circle to four
dimensions. This involves solving a certain quantum mechanical matrix model. We
do this for the lift of the N=1* theory to five dimensions. We show that the
resulting expression for the superpotential in the confining vacuum is
identical with the elliptic superpotential approach based on Nekrasov's
five-dimensional generalization of Seiberg-Witten theory involving the
relativistic elliptic Calogero-Moser, or Ruijsenaars-Schneider, integrable
system.
