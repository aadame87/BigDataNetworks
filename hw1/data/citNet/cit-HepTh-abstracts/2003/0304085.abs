Title: Bosonic string theory in background fields by canonical methods

  We investigate classical dynamics of the bosonic string in the background
metric, antisymmetric and dilaton fields. We use canonical methods to find
Hamiltonian in terms of energy-momentum tensor components. The later are
secondary constraints of the theory. Due to the presence of the dilaton field
the Virasoro generators have nonlinear realization. We find that, in the curve
space-time, opposite chirality currents do not commute. As a consequence of the
two-dimensional general covariance, the energy-momentum tensor components
satisfy two Virasoro algebras, even in the curve space-time. We obtain new
gauge symmetry which acts on both world-sheet and space-time variables, and
includes world-sheet Weyl transformation. We emphasize that background
antisymmetric and dilaton fields are the origin of space-time torsion and
space-time nonmetricity, respectively.
