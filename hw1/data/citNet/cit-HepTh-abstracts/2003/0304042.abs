Title: Monopoles, Duality, and String Theory
Authors: Joseph Polchinski
Comments: Presented at the Dirac Centennial Symposium, Tallahassee, Dec. 6-7,
  2002

  Dirac showed that the existence of magnetic monopoles would imply
quantization of electric charge. I discuss the converse, and propose two
`principles of completeness' which I illustrate with various examples.
