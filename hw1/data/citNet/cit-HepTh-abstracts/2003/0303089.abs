  We consider asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes in $d$-spacetime
dimensions in the thermodynamically stable regime. We show that the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its leading order corrections due to thermal
fluctuations can be reproduced by a weakly interacting fluid of bosons and
fermions (`holographic gas') in $\Delta=\alpha(d-2)+1$ spacetime dimensions,
where the energy-momentum dispersion relation for the constituents of the fluid
is assumed to be $\epsilon = \kappa p^\alpha$. We examine implications of this
result for entropy bounds and the holographic hypothesis.
