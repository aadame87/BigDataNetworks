Title: AdS and pp-wave D-particle superalgebras
Authors: Machiko Hatsuda
Comments: 15 pages

  We derive anticommutators of supercharges with a brane charge for a
D-particle in AdS(2) x S(2) and pp-wave backgrounds. A coset GL(2|2)/(GL(1))^4
and its Penrose limit are used with the supermatrix-valued coordinates for the
AdS and the pp-wave spaces respectively. The brane charges have position
dependence, and can be absorbed into bosonic generators by shift of momenta
which results in closure of the superalgebras.
