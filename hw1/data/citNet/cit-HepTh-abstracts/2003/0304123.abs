  We study quivers in the context of matrix models. We introduce chains of
generalized Konishi anomalies to write the quadratic and cubic equations that
constrain the resolvents of general affine and non-affine quiver gauge
theories, and give a procedure to calculate all higher-order relations. For
these theories we also evaluate, as functions of the resolvents, VEV's of
chiral operators with two and four bifundamental insertions. As an example of
the general procedure we explicitly consider the two simplest quivers A2 and
A1(affine), obtaining in the first case a cubic algebraic curve, and for the
affine theory the same equation as that of U(N) theories with adjoint matter,
successfully reproducing the RG cascade result.
