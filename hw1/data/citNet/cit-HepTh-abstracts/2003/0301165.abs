  An inflationary brane model driven by a bulk inflaton with exponential
potential is proposed. We find a family of exact solutions that describe
power-law inflation on the brane. These solutions enable us to derive exact
solutions for metric perturbations analytically. By calculating scalar and
tensor perturbations, we obtain a spectrum of primordial fluctuations at the
end of the inflation. The amplitudes of scalar and tensor perturbations are
enhanced in the same way if the energy scale of the inflation is sufficiently
higher than the tension of the brane. Then the relative amplitude of scalar and
tensor perturbations is not suppressed even for high-energy inflation. This is
a distinguishable feature from the inflation model driven by inflaton on the
brane where tensor perturbations are suppressed for high-energy inflation. We
also point out that massive Kaluza-Klein modes are not negligible at
high-frequencies on 3-space of our brane.
