  The absorption cross section for scattering of fermions off an extreme BTZ
black hole is calculated. It is shown that, as in the case of scalar particles,
an extreme BTZ black hole exhibits an absorption cross section equals to zero,
what is consistent with the vanishing entropy of such object. We also show that
the Dirac equation, in this background, can be solved completely for a very
special case where the energy of the incident wave and the azimuthal eigenvalue
must satisfy a {\it fine tuning condition}. Additionally, we give a general
argument to prove that the particle flux near the horizon is zero, no matter
how they are constructed. Finally we show that the {\it reciprocal space},
introduced in a previous work, gives rise to the same result and, therefore, it
could be considered as the space where the scattering process take place in a
AdS spacetime.
