Title: Deconfinement mechanism in three dimensions for gauge fields coupled to
  bosonic matter fields with fundamental charge

  We propose a mechanism by which electric charges deconfine in an Abelian
Higgs model with matter fields belonging to the fundamental representation of
the gauge group. Kosterlitz-Thouless like recursion relations for a
scale-dependent stiffness parameter and fugacity are given, showing that for a
logarithmic potential between point charges in any dimension, there exists a
stable fixed point at zero fugacity, with a dimensionality dependent universal
jump in the stiffness parameter at the phase transition.
