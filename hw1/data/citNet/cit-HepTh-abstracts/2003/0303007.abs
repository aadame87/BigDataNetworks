Title: Graviton-Scalar Interaction in the PP-Wave Background
Authors: K.Bobkov
Comments: 26 pages, harvmac One reference added. A few comments changed in the
  introduction. The "cyclic perms." term removed from some equations as
  unnecessary and equations (2.38) and (3.19) are corrected accordingly

  We compute the graviton two scalar off-shell interaction vertex at tree level
in Type IIB superstring theory on the pp-wave background using the light-cone
string field theory formalism. We then show that the tree level vertex vanishes
when all particles are on-shell and conservation of p_{+} and p_{-} are
imposed. We reinforce our claim by calculating the same vertex starting from
the corresponding SUGRA action expanded around the pp-wave background in the
light-cone gauge.
