Title: Three-loop $\beta$-function for N=1 supersymmetric electrodynamics,
  regularized by higher derivatives
Authors: A.A.Soloshenko, K.V.Stepanyantz

\\
  Three-loop quantum corrections to the effective action are calculated for N=1
supersymmetric electrodynamics, regularized by higher derivatives. Using the
obtained results we investigate the anomaly puzzle in the considered model.
