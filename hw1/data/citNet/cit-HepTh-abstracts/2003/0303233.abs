  Noncommutative U(N) gauge theories at different N may be often thought of as
different sectors of a single theory: the U(1) theory possesses a sequence of
vacua labeled by an integer parameter N, and the theory in the vicinity of the
N-th vacuum coincides with the U(N) noncommutative gauge theory. We construct
noncommutative domain walls on fuzzy cylinder, separating vacua with different
gauge theories. These domain walls are solutions of BPS equations in gauge
theory with an extra term stabilizing the radius of the cylinder. We study
properties of the domain walls using adjoint scalar and fundamental fermion
fields as probes. We show that the regions on different sides of the wall are
not disjoint even in the low energy regime -- there are modes penetrating from
one region to the other. We find that the wall supports a chiral fermion zero
mode. Also, we study non-BPS solution representing a wall and an antiwall, and
show that this solution is unstable. We suggest that the domain walls emerge as
solutions of matrix model in large class of pp-wave backgrounds with
inhomogeneous field strength. In the M-theory language, the domain walls have
an interpretation of a stack of branes of fingerstall shape inserted into a
stack of cylindrical branes.
