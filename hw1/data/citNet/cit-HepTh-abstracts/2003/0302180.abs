  Starting from a self-dual formulation of gravity, we obtain a noncommutative
theory of pure Einstein theory in four dimensions. In order to do that, we use
Seiberg-Witten map. It is shown that the noncommutative torsion constraint is
solved by the vanishing of commutative torsion. Finally, the noncommutative
corrections to the action are computed up to second order.
