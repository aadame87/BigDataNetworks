  We realize the CFT with target a lens space SU(2)/Z_l as a simple current
construction. This allows us to compute the boundary states and the annuli
coefficients, and in particular to study the B-type branes, in purely algebraic
terms. Several issues, like the appearance of fractional branes and symmetry
breaking boundary conditions, can be addressed more directly in this approach
than in a more geometric treatment.
