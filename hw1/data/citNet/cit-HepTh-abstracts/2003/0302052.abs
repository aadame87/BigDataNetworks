Title: Chronology Protection in String Theory
Authors: Lisa Dyson
\\
  Many solutions of General Relativity appear to allow the possibility of time
travel. This was initially a fascinating discovery, but geometries of this type
violate causality, a basic physical law that is believed to be fundamental.
Although string theory is a proposed fundamental theory of quantum gravity,
geometries with closed time-like curves have resurfaced as solutions to its low
energy equations of motion. In this work, we will study the class of solutions
to low energy effective supergravity theories related to the BMPV black hole
and the rotating D1-D5-wave. Time travel appears to be possible in these
geometries. We will attempt to build the causality violating regions and
propose that stringy effects prohibit their construction. The proposed
chronology protection agent for these geometries mirrors a mechanism string
theory employs to resolve a class of naked time-like singularities.
