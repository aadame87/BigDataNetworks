  We discuss the Burgers equation and the exact solutions on (1+1)-dimensional
noncommutative spaces. We obtain the noncommutative version of the Burgers
equation which possesses the Lax representation by the Lax-pair generating
technique and succeed in the linearization of it by noncommutative version of
the Cole-Hopf transformations. We find the simple solutions of the linearized
equation exactly and discuss more general solutions by the Weyl transformation.
We also present the noncommutative Burgers hierarchy.
