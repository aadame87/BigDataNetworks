Title: First Order Formalism for Mixed Symmetry Tensor Fields
Authors: Yu. M. Zinoviev

  In this paper we give explicit first order Lagrangian formulation for mixed
symmetry tensor fields \Phi_{[\mu\nu],\alpha}, T_{[\mu\nu\alpha],\beta} and
R_{[\mu\nu],[\alpha\beta]}. We show that such Lagrangians could be written in a
very suggestive form similar to the well known tetrad formalism in gravity.
Such description could simplify the investigations of possible interactions for
these fields. Some examples of interactions are given.
