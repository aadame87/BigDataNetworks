  We point out that the recently proposed model of a flat 4-dimensional
universe with accelerated expansion in string/M-theory is a special case of
time-dependent solutions that the author found under the name of ``S-branes.''
We also show that similar accelerating models can be obtained from S-branes if
the internal space is chosen to be hyperbolic or flat spaces.
