  We compute the meson spectrum of an N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with
fundamental matter from its dual string theory on AdS5 x S5 with a D7-brane
probe. For scalar and vector mesons with arbitrary R-charge the spectrum is
computed in closed form by solving the equations for D7-brane fluctuations; for
matter with non-zero mass m_q it is discrete, exhibits a mass gap of order
m_q/sqrt(g_s N) and furnishes representations of SO(5) even though the manifest
global symmetry of the theory is only SO(4). The spectrum of mesons with large
spin J is obtained from semiclassical rotating open strings attached to the
D7-brane. It displays Regge-like behaviour for J<<sqrt(g_s N), whereas for
J>>sqrt(g_s N) it corresponds to that of two non-relativistic quarks bound by a
Coulomb potential. Meson interactions, baryons and 'giant gauge bosons' are
briefly discussed
