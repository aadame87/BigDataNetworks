Title: N=1 SUSY inspired Whitham prepotentials and WDVV
Authors: A.Mironov
Comments: 7 pages, references added, based on talk presented at the 35th
  Symposium Ahrenshoop
\\
  This brief review deals with prepotentials inspired by N=1 SUSY
considerations due to Cachazo, Intrilligator, Vafa. These prepotentials
associated with matrix models following Dijkgraaf and Vafa should be considered
as given on an enlarged moduli space that includes Whitham times (couplings of
the superpotential). This moduli space is nothing but the whole moduli space of
(decorated) hyperelliptic curves. Corresponding prepotentials are logarithms of
(quasiclassical) tau-functions and satisfy the WDVV equations.
