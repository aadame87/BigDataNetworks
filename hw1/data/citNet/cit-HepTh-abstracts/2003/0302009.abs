  In this paper, a general theory on unification of non-Abelian SU(N) gauge
interactions and gravitational gauge interactions is discussed. SU(N) gauge
interactions and gravitational gauge interactions are formulated on the similar
basis and are unified in a semi-direct product group GSU(N). Based on this
model, we can discuss unification of fundamental interactions of Nature.
