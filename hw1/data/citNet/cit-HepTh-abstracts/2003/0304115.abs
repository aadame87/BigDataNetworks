  We reconsider the question of which Calabi-Yau compactifications of the
heterotic string are stable under world-sheet instanton corrections to the
effective space-time superpotential. For instance, compactifications described
by (0,2) linear sigma models are believed to be stable, suggesting a remarkable
cancellation among the instanton effects in these theories. Here, we show that
this cancellation follows directly from a residue theorem, whose proof relies
only upon the right-moving world-sheet supersymmetries and suitable compactness
properties of the (0,2) linear sigma model. Our residue theorem also extends to
a new class of "half-linear" sigma models. Using these half-linear models, we
show that heterotic compactifications on the quintic hypersurface in CP^4 for
which the gauge bundle pulls back from a bundle on CP^4 are stable. Finally, we
apply similar ideas to compute the superpotential contributions from families
of membrane instantons in M-theory compactifications on manifolds of G_2
holonomy.
