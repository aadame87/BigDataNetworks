  We show how the full holomorphic geometry of local Calabi-Yau threefold
compactifications with N=1 supersymmetry can be obtained from matrix models. In
particular for the conifold geometry we relate F-terms to the general
amplitudes of c=1 non-critical bosonic string theory, and express them in a
quiver or, equivalently, super matrix model. Moreover we relate, by
deconstruction, the uncompactified c=1 theory to the six-dimensional conformal
(2,0) theory. Furthermore, we show how we can use the idea of deconstruction to
connect 4+k dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories to a k-dimensional
internal bosonic gauge theory, generalizing the relation between 4d theories
and matrix models. Examples of such bosonic systems include unitary matrix
models and gauged matrix quantum mechanics, which deconstruct 5-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theories, and Chern-Simons gauge theories, which
deconstruct gauge theories living on branes wrapped over cycles in Calabi-Yau
threefolds.
