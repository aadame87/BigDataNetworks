Title: Open String Plane-Wave Light-Cone Superstring Field Theory
Authors: B. Stefanski Jr
\\
  We construct the cubic interaction vertex and dynamically generated
supercharges in light-cone superstring field theory for a large class
half-supersymmetric D-branes in the plane-wave background. We show that these
satisfy the plane-wave superalgebra at first order in string coupling. The
cubic interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges presented here are given
explicitly in terms of oscilators and can be used to compute three-point
functions of open strings with endpoints on half-supersymmetric D-branes.
