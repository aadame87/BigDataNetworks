  The strong magnetic field behaviour of the fermion-induced effective energy
in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, has recently attract
attention, see Refs. [1,2,3,5,6]. In Ref. [3], we presented an asymptotic
formula for the fermion-induced effective energy in 3+1 dimensions in the
presence of a cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous strong magnetic field of
finite magnetic flux $\Phi$. However, the proof of the formula was presented in
a condensed form and there are some points which were not clearly explained.
 The aim of this work is to present the complete proof in detail.
