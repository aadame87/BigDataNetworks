Authors: D. Grumiller, W. Kummer and D.V. Vassilevich
Comments: 5 pages (twocolumn), proceedings contribution to the XIV Hutsulian
  workshop on "Mathematical Theories and their Physical & Technical
  Applications", v2: version as it appears in the Ukrainian Journal of Physics,
  added references and clarifying remarks

\\
  Some simple observations concerning certain kappa-deformations in the
framework of 2D dilaton gravity formulated as Poisson-sigma models are
discussed, and the question of (non-)triviality is addressed.
