Title: Tachyon Effective Actions In Open String Theory

  We argue that the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action coupled to a tachyon, that
is known to reproduce some aspects of open string dynamics, can be obtained
from open string theory in a certain limit, which generalizes the limit leading
to the usual DBI action. This helps clarify which aspects of the full open
string theory are captured by this action.
