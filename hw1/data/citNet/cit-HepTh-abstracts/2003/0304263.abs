Title: Seiberg-Witten Monopole Equations on Noncommutative R^4

  It is well known that, due to vanishing theorems, there are no nontrivial
finite action solutions to the Abelian Seiberg-Witten (SW) monopole equations
on Euclidean four-dimensional space R^4. We show that this is no longer true
for the noncommutative version of these equations, i.e. on a noncommutative
deformation R^4_\theta of R^4 there exist smooth solutions to the SW equations
having nonzero topological charge. We introduce action functionals for the
noncommutative SW equations and construct explicit regular solutions. All our
solutions have finite energy. We also suggest a possible interpretation of the
obtained solutions as codimension four vortex-like solitons representing
D(p-4)- and anti-D(p-4)-branes in a Dp-anti-Dp brane system in type II
superstring theory.
