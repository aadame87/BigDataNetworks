  We study time dependent solutions in cubic open string field theory which is
expected to describe the configuration of the rolling tachyon. We consider the
truncated system consisting of component fields of level zero and two, which
are expanded in terms of cosh n x^0 modes. For studying the large time behavior
of the solution we need to know the coefficients of all and, in particular,
large n modes. We examine numerically the coefficients of the n-th mode, and
find that it has the leading n-dependence of the form (-\beta)^n \lambda^{-n^2}
multiplied by a peculiar subleading part with peaks at
n=2^m=4,8,16,32,64,128,.... This behavior is also reproduced analytically by
solving simplified equations of motion of the tachyon system.
