  We investigate the description of the region behind the event horizon in
rotating black holes in the AdS/CFT correspondence, using the rotating BTZ
black hole as a concrete example. We extend a technique introduced by Kraus,
Ooguri and Shenker [hep-th/0212277], based on analytically continuing
amplitudes defined in a Euclidean space, to include rotation. In the rotating
case, boundary amplitudes again have two different bulk descriptions, involving
either integration only over the regions outside the black holes' event
horizon, or integration over this region and the region between the event
horizon and the Cauchy horizon (inner horizon). We argue that generally, the
holographic map will relate the field theory to the region bounded by the
Cauchy horizons in spacetime. We also argue that these results suggest that the
holographic description of black holes will satisfy strong cosmic censorship.
