  We confirm earlier hints that the conventional phase diagram of the discrete
chiral Gross-Neveu model in the large N limit is deficient at non-zero chemical
potential. We present the corrected phase diagram constructed in mean field
theory. It has three different phases, including a kink-antikink crystal phase.
All transitions are second order. The driving mechanism for the new structure
of baryonic matter in the Gross-Neveu model is an Overhauser type instability
with gap formation at the Fermi surface.
