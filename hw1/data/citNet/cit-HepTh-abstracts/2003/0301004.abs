  We derive recurrence relations between phase space expressions in different
dimensions by confining some of the coordinates to tori or spheres of radius
$R$ and taking the limit as $R \to \infty$. These relations take the form of
mass integrals, associated with extraneous momenta (relative to the lower
dimension), and produce the result in the higher dimension.
