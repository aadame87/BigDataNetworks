  The `Landau--Ginzburg' theory of Girvin and MacDonald, modified by adding the
natural magnetic term, is shown to admit stable topological as well as
non-topological vortex solutions. The system is the commun $\lambda\to0$ limit
of two slightly different non-relativistic Maxwell--Chern--Simons models of the
type introduced recently by Manton. The equivalence with the model of Zhang,
Hansson and Kivelson is demonstrated.
