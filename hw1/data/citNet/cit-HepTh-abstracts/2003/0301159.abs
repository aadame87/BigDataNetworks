  Irreversibility

  In this third of a series of articles, we continue the study of the dynamical
transformations of systems of correlated quantized oscillators. By including
generalized wave function solutions to Schr{\"o}dinger's equation belonging to
a rigged Hilbert space, and by considering the algebra of observables as a
whole, the presence of hyperbolic quasi-invariant measures, torus actions,
ergodicity and entropy generation associated to the non-invertible decay of
Gamow vectors and associated to Breit-Wigner resonances is shown. A weak
(local) form of the second law of thermodynamics is demonstrated through the
decay of resonances. Both coherence formation and decoherence (decay) are
associated with irreversibility and may be associated with entropy growth.
Hilbert space is the manifold of non-ergodic stationary states. There is a
fractal structure associated with time evolution of resonances in the space of
generalized states, and the statistical nature of the exponential decay may be
identified with quasi-trapping. Equilibrium states may be regarded as strange
attractors with respect to dynamical time evolution.
