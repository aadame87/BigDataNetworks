  We have extended previous analysis of the bulk/brane supersymmetrizations
involving non-zero brane mass terms of bulk fermions (gravitini) and twisting
of boundary conditions. We have constructed new brane/bulk models that may be
relevant for realistic model building. In particular, we have built a model
with the Randall-Sundrum bosonic sector, orthogonal projection operators on the
branes in the fermionic sector, and an unbroken N=1 supersymmetry. We have also
constructed 5d super-bigravity with static vacuum and unbroken N=1
supersymmetry, which may be viewed as a deconstruction of 5d supergravity.
