  Supersymmetric backgrounds in string and M-theory of the Godel Universe type
are studied. We find several new Godel Universes that preserve up to 20
supersymmetries. In particular, we obtain an interesting Godel Universe in
M-theory with 18 supersymmetries which does not seem to be dual to a pp-wave.
We show that not only T-duality but also the type-IIA/M-theory S-duality can
give supersymmetric Godel Universes from pp-waves. We find solutions that can
interpolate between Godel Universes and pp-waves. We also compute the string
spectrum on two type IIA Godel Universes. Furthermore, we obtain the spectrum
of D-branes on a Godel Universe and find the supergravity solution for a
D4-brane on a Godel Universe.
