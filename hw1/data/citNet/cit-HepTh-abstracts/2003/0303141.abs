  We calculate circular Wilson loop expectation value of pure ${\cal N}=1$
super Yang-Mills from the Klebanov-Strassker-Tseytlin solution of supergravity
and the proposed gauge/gravity duality. The calculation is performed
numerically via searching world-sheet minimal surface. It is shown that Wilson
loop exhibits area law for large radius which implies that ${\cal N}=1$ super
Yang-Mills is confined at large distance or low energy scale. Meanwhile, Wilson
loop exhibits logarithmic behavior for small radius and it indicates
asymptotical freedom of ${\cal N}=1$ super Yang-Mills at short distance or high
energy scale.
