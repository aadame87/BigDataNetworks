Title: Nonlocal action for long-distance modifications of gravity theory
Author: A.O.Barvinsky
Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX
\\
  We construct the covariant nonlocal action for recently suggested
long-distance modifications of gravity theory motivated by the cosmological
constant and cosmological acceleration problems. This construction is based on
the special nonlocal form of the Einstein-Hilbert action explicitly revealing
the fact that this action within the covariant curvature expansion begins with
curvature-squared terms.
