  One-loop corrections to kink masses in a family of (1+1)-dimensional field
theoretical models with two scalar fields are computed. A generalized DHN
formula applicable to reflection and reflectionless potentials is obtained. It
is thus shown how half-bound states arising in the spectrum of the second order
fluctuation operator around TK1 kinks and the vacuum play a central role in the
computation of the kink Casimir energy. The issue of whether or not the kink
degeneracy exhibited by this family of models at the classical level survives
quantum fluctuations up to the one-loop order is addressed.
