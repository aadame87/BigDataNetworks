Title: Non-linear Brane Dynamics in a Six Dimensional Model
Authors: Bertha Cuadros-Melgar
Comments: 24 pages, 9 figures
\\
  We consider a dynamical brane world in a six dimensional spacetime containing
a singularity. Using the Israel conditions we study the motion of a 4-brane
embedded in this setup. We analize the brane behavior when its position is
perturbed about a fixed point and solve the full non-linear dynamics in the
several possible scenarios. We also investigate the possible gravitational
shortcuts and calculate the delay between graviton and photon signals and the
ratio of the corresponding subtended horizons.
