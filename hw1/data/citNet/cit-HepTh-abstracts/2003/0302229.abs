Title: Fermion production in time-dependent fields
Authors: Dennis D. Dietrich
Comments: 27 pages, 4 figures
\\
  The exact fermion propagator in a classical time-dependent gauge field is
derived by solving the equation of motion for the Dirac Green's functions. From
the retarded propagator obtained in this way the momentum spectrum for the
produced fermion pairs is calculated. Different approximations and the exact
solution for the propagator and the momentum spectrum are presented.
