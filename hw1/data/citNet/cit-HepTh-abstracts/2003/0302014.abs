  The magnetic field redefinition in Jain's composite fermion model for the
fractional quantum Hall effect is shown to be effectively described by a
mean-field approximation of a model containing a Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge
field non-minimally coupled to matter. Also an explicit non-relativistic limit
of the non-minimal (2+1)D Dirac equation is derived.
