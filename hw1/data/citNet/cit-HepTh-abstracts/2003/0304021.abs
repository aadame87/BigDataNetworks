  We evaluate the spectral function of scalar and spinor propagator in three
dimensional quantum electrodynamics with the use of Ward-Identity for
soft-photon emission vertex. Exponentation of one-photon matrix element yields
a fll propagator in position space.It has a simple form as free propagator
multiplied by quantum correction.But this is not a integrable function so that
analysis in momentum space is not easy.Term by term integral converges and they
have a logarithmic singuralities associated with renormalized mass in
perturbation theory.Renormalization constant vanishes for weak coupling,which
suggests confinement of charged particle.There exists a critical coupling
constant below which bare mass vanishes and the vacuum expectationvalue of pair
condensation is finite.
