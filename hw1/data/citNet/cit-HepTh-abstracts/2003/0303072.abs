Title: Nonabelian Phenomena on D-branes
Authors: Robert C. Myers
Comments: Lecture at Leuven workshop on ``The quantum structure of spacetime
  and the geometrical nature of fundamental interactions'' (September 13-19,
  2002)

  A remarkable feature of D-branes is the appearance of a nonabelian gauge
theory in the description of several (nearly) coincident branes. This
nonabelian structure plays an important role in realizing various geometric
effects with D-branes. In particular, the branes' transverse displacements are
described by matrix-valued scalar fields and so noncommutative geometry
naturally appears in this framework. I review the action governing this
nonabelian theory, as well as various related physical phenomena such as the
dielectric effect, giant gravitons and fuzzy funnels.
