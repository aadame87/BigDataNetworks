  This article contains an overview of some recent attempts at understanding
supergravity and string duals of four dimensional gauge theories using the
AdS/CFT correspondence. We discuss the general philosophy underlying the
various ways to realize Super Yang-Mills theories in terms of systems of
branes. We then review some of the existing duals for N=2 and N=1 theories. We
also discuss differences and similarities with realistic theories.
