Title: The Quark-Meson Model and the Phase Diagram of Two-Flavour QCD

  We study the qualitative features of the QCD phase diagram in the context of
the linear quark-meson model with two flavours, using the exact renormalization
group. We identify the universality classes of the second-order phase
transitions and calculate critical exponents. In the absence of explicit
chiral-symmetry breaking through the current quark masses, we discuss in detail
the tricritical point and demonstrate that it is linked to the Gaussian fixed
point. In its vicinity we study the universal crossover between the Gaussian
and O(4) fixed points, and the weak first-order phase transitions. In the
presence of explicit chiral-symmetry breaking, we study in detail the critical
endpoint of the line of first-order phase transitions. We demonstrate the
decoupling of pion fluctuations and identify the Ising universality class as
the relevant one for the second-order phase transition.
