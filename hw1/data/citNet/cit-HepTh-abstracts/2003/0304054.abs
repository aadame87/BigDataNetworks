Title: Supergravity and IOSp(3,1|4) gauge theory
Authors: T. G. Philbin
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  Simple D=4 supergravity is obtained from the gauge theory of the
inhomogeneous orthosymplectic group IOSp(3,1|4) on a (4,4)-dimensional base
supermanifold by imposing constraints and talking a limit. Both the constraints
and the limiting procedure have a clear a priori physical motivation. The
construction has similarities with the space-time formulation of Newtonian
gravity.
