  In this Note, we study bosonization of the noncommutative massive Thirring
model in 2+1- dimensions. We show that, contrary to the duality between massive
Thirring model and Maxwell-Chern-Simons model in ordinary spacetime, in the low
energy (or large fermion mass) limit, their noncommutative versions are not
equivalent, in the same approximation.
