Title: Supersymmetry breaking and 4 dimensional string models
Authors: Michael Hewitt
Comments: 6 pages, Latex 2e
\\
  A family of superpotentials is constructed which may be relevant to
supersymmetry breaking in 4 dimensional (0,1) heterotic string models. The
scale of supersymmetry breaking, as well as the coupling constant, would be
stable and could not run away to zero.
