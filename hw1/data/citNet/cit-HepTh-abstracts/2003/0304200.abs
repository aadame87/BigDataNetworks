Title: Twisted Moduli Stabilization in Type I String Models
Authors: Tetsutaro Higaki and Tatsuo Kobayashi
Comments: 18 pages, latex, 3 figures
\\
  We consider the model with the dilaton and twisted moduli fields, which is
inspired by type I string models. Stabilization of their vacuum expectation
values is studied. We find the stabilization of the twisted moduli field has
different aspects from the dilaton stabilization.
