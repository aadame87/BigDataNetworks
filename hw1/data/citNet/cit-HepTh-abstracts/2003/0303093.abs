  In this paper, we study the cosmological evolution of imaginary configuration
for scalar fields with an O(\textit{N}) symmetry and discuss that it is
possible to realize the equation-of-state parameter $w<-1$. We show that the
introduction of negative kinetic energy of scalar fields could be equivalently
realized by a vector anti-unitary representation of the O(\textit{N}) group.
When the fields are constrained with an O(\textit{N}) symmetry, they are more
stable than that without symmetry. In the exponential potential, the
O(\textit{N}) phantom field imposes a lower bound for the equation of state
$w>-2$. We also derive the relations between the potential of the field and the
red-shift, known as reconstruction equations.
