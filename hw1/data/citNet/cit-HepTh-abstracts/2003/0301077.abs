  The renormalization-group functions of the two-dimensional n-vector \lambda
\phi^4 model are calculated in the five-loop approximation. Perturbative series
for the \beta-function and critical exponents are resummed by the
Pade-Borel-Leroy techniques. An account for the five-loop term shifts the
Wilson fixed point location only briefly, leaving it outside the segment formed
by the results of the lattice calculations. This is argued to reflect the
influence of the non-analytical contribution to the \beta-function. The
evaluation of the critical exponents for n = 1, n = 0 and n = -1 in the
five-loop approximation and comparison of the results with known exact values
confirm the conclusion that non-analytical contributions are visible in two
dimensions. For the 2D Ising model, the estimate \omega = 1.31 for the
correction-to-scaling exponent is found.
