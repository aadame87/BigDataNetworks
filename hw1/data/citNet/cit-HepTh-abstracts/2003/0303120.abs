  We investigate quantum corrections in non-commutative gauge theory on fuzzy
sphere. We study translation invariant models which classically favor a single
fuzzy sphere with U(1) gauge group. We evaluate the effective actions up to the
two loop level. We find non-vanishing quantum corrections at each order even in
supersymmetric models. It is consistent with the fact that there is no unbroken
supersymmetry in de-Sitter space. In particular the two loop contribution
favors U(n) gauge group over U(1) contrary to the tree action in a deformed IIB
matrix model with a Myers term. We further observe close correspondences to 2
dimensional quantum gravity.
