Title: Exact Solutions in SFT and Marginal Deformation in BCFT
Authors: J. Kluson
Comments: 15 pages
\\
  In this note we will study solution of open bosonic string field theory based
on action of operators from chiral algebra of boundary conformal field theory
on identity element of string field theory star algebra. We will demonstrate
that the string field theory action for fluctuation fields around this
classical solution can be mapped to the string field theory action defined
through the new boundary conformal field theory that arises from the original
one through the marginal deformation inserted on the world-sheet boundary.
