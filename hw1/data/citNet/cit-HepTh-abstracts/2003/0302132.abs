  We study the properties of anti-de Sitter black holes for various horizon
topologies (k=0,\pm 1) and for various dimensions. We explore the thermodynamic
and classical (in)stability of higher dimensional black holes with emphasis on
the less well understood k=-1 solution. In particular, we show that there
exists a unique k=-1 extremal black hole solution which has the lowest energy
for all spacetimes in its asymptotic class. What looks encouraging is that the
Gauss-Bonnet type curvature corrections to the Einstein action not only admit
exact solutions but they might be crucial for stability of hyperbolic (k=-1)
black holes. This in turn implies that the hyperbolic spacetimes can be stable
thermodynamically and classically if the background is defined by an extremal
solution and the extremal entropy is non-negative. For the ground state metric
taken from the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, the gravitational potential can be
positive and bounded from below for a small coupling \alpha~(<<l^2), with $l$
being the effective curvature radius of anti-de Sitter space.
