  transformation and Ramond-Ramond couplings

  We propose an exact expression for the unintegrated form of the star gauge
invariant axial anomaly in an arbitrary even dimensional gauge theory. The
proposal is based on the inverse Seiberg-Witten map and identities related to
it, obtained earlier by comparing Ramond-Ramond couplings in different
decsriptions. The integrated anomalies are expressed in terms of a simplified
version of the Elliott formula involving the noncommutative Chern character.
These anomalies, under the Seiberg-Witten transformation, reduce to the
ordinary axial anomalies. Compatibility with existing results of anomalies in
noncommutative theories is established.
