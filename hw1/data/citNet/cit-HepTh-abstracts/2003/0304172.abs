  We study aspects of the accelerating cosmologies obtained from the
compactification of vacuum solution and S2-branes of superstring/M theories.
Parameter dependence of the resulting expansion of our universe and internal
space is examined for all cases. We find that accelerating expansions are
obtained also from spherical internal spaces, albeit the solution enters into
contracting phase eventually. The relation between the models of SM2- and
SD2-branes are also discussed, and a potential problem with SD2-brane model is
noted.
