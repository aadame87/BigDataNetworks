Title: Minimal coupling of the Kalb-Ramond field to a scalar field

  We study the direct interaction of an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field with a
scalar particle derived from a gauge principle. The method outlined in this
paper to define a covariant derivative is applied to a simple model leading to
a linear coupling between the fields. Although no conserved Noether charge
exists, a conserved topological current comes out from the antisymmetry
properties of the Kalb-Ramond field. Some interesting features of this current
are pointed out.
