  Schwarzschild black hole being thermodynamically unstable, corrections to its
entropy due to small thermal fluctuations cannot be computed. However, a
thermodynamically stable Schwarzschild solution can be obtained within a cavity
of any finite radius by immersing it in an isothermal bath. For these boundary
conditions, classically there are either two black hole solutions or no
solution. In the former case, the larger mass solution has a positive specific
heat and hence is locally thermodynamically stable. We find that the entropy of
this black hole, including first order fluctuation corrections is given by:
${\cal S} = S_{BH} - \ln[\f{3}{R} (S_{BH}/4\p)^{1/2} -2]^{-1} + (1/2)
\ln(4\p)$, where $S_{BH}=A/4$ is its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and $R$ is the
radius of the cavity. We extend our results to four dimensional
Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, for which the corresponding expression is:
${\cal S} = S_{BH} - \f{1}{2} \ln [ {(S_{BH}/\p R^2) ({3S_{BH}}/{\p R^2} -
2\sqrt{{S_{BH}}/{\p R^2 -\a^2}}) \le(\sqrt{{S_{BH}}/{\p R^2}} - \a^2 \ri)}/
{\le({S_{BH}}/{\p R^2} -\a^2 \ri)^2} ]^{-1} +(1/2)\ln(4\p).$ Finally, we
generalise the stability analysis to Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in
arbitrary spacetime dimensions, and compute their leading order entropy
corrections. We find that in contrast to previously studied examples the
entropy corrections in these cases have a dissimilar character.
