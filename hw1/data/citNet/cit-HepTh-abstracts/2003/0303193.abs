  We study supersymmetric intersections of M2 and M5 branes with different
pp-waves of M-theory. We consider first M-brane probes in the background of
pp-waves and determine under which conditions the embedding is supersymmetric.
We particularize our formalism to the case of pp-waves with 32, 24 and 20
supersymmetries. We also construct supergravity solutions for the brane-wave
system. Generically these solutions are delocalised along some directions
transverse to the brane and preserve the same number of supersymmetries as in
the brane probe approach.
