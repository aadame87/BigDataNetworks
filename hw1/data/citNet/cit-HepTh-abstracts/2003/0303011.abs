  The role of quantum effects in brane-world cosmology is investigated. It is
shown in time-independent formulation that quantum creation of deSitter branes
in five-dimensional (A)dS bulk occurs with also account of brane quantum CFT
contribution. The surface action is chosen to include cosmological constant and
curvature term. (The time-dependent formulation of quantum-corrected brane FRW
equations is shown to be convenient for comparison with Supernovae data). The
particles creation on deSitter brane is estimated and is shown to be increased
due to KK modes. The deSitter brane effective potential due to bulk quantum
matter on 5d AdS space is found. It may be used to get the observable
cosmological constant in the minimum of the potential (stabilization). The
appearence of the entropy bounds from bulk field equation is also mentioned.
