  We give brane-world solutions with cosmological constant $\lambda$ by
introducing the dilaton in 5d bulk, and we have examined the localization of
graviton, gauge bosons and dilaton. For the solutions given here, we find that
both graviton and gauge bosons can be trapped for any sign, positive and
negative, and wide range of $\lambda$ due to the dilaton. On the other hand,
the bulk dilaton can not be trapped as a stable particle on a brane of
$\lambda\geq 0$. This implies a possible resolution of the moduli problem and
the equivalence principle in superstring theory since the dilaton can not be
localized on the brane as a partner of the graviton.
