  We analyze the nonrelativistic quantum scattering problem of a charged
particle by an Abelian magnetic monopole in the background of a global
monopole. In addition to the magnetic and geometric effects, we consider the
influence of the electrostatic self-interaction on the charged particle.
Moreover, for the specific case where the electrostatic self-interaction
becomes attractive, charged particle-monopole bound system can be formed and
the respective energy spectrum is hydrogen-like one.
