  The NAHE-set, that underlies the realistic free fermionic models, corresponds
to Z2XZ2 orbifold at an enhanced symmetry point, with (h_{11},h_{21})=(27,3).
Alternatively, a manifold with the same data is obtained by starting with a
Z2XZ2 orbifold at a generic point on the lattice and adding a freely acting Z2
involution. In this paper we study type I orientifolds on the manifolds that
underly the NAHE-based models by incorporating such freely acting shifts. We
present new models in the Type I vacuum which are modulated by Z2^n for n=2,3.
In the case of n=2, the Z2XZ2 structure is a composite orbifold Kaluza-Klein
shift arrangement. The partition function provides a simpler spectrum with
chiral matter. For n=3, the two cases discusse are Z2 modulations of the
T^6/(Z2 X Z2) spectrum. The additional projection shows an enhanced closed and
open sector with chiral matter. The second example involves a modulation using
a product of Kaluza Klein and winding shifts. The winding shift provides this
model with a simpler torus spectrum, particularly with the removal of part of
the twisted sector. In from those which are present in the Z2XZ2 orbifold. The
last two incorporate twisted terms that can provide discrete torsion, we
discuss the spectral content of each model with discrete torsion with
particular choice epsilon=(1,1,-1).
