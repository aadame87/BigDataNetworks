Title: A Model of Quantum Field Theory with Inter Source
Authors: Gang Zhao
Comments: 6 pages, RevTex
\\
  By putting a confined inter source, we construct a model which can give us
convergent solution from free field equation. On the other hand, the solution
of new field equation can be separated into two parts, one part is just same as
the one in Quantum Field Theory and make it survived in this model, and the
other part, which we will see doesn't take energy and momentum, just gives us a
negative propagator which can soften quadratic divergence.
