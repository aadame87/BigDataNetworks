  It is shown that the problem of the recursive restoration of the
Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identities at the quantum level for anomaly-free gauge
theories is equivalent to the problem of parameterizing the local approximation
to the quantum effective action in terms of ST functionals, associated with the
cohomology classes of the classical linearized ST operator. The ST functionals
of dimension <=4 correspond to the invariant counterterms, those of dimension
>4 generate the non-symmetric counterterms upon projection on the action-like
sector. At orders higher than one in the loop expansion there are additional
contributions to the non-invariant counterterms, arising from known lower order
terms. They can also be parameterized by using the ST functionals. We apply the
method to Yang-Mills theory with one family of chiral fermions in the Landau
gauge and derive the most general solution for the action-like part of the
quantum effective action, compatible with the fulfillment of the ST identities
and of the other relevant symmetries of the model. The full dependence of the
solution on the normalization conditions is given.
