Title: Low energy dynamics of self-dual A_1 strings
Authors: Andreas Gustavsson
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  We examine the interrelation between the (2,0) supersymmetric six dimensional
effective action for the A_1 theory, and the corresponding low-energy theory
for the collective coordinates associated to supersymmetric selfdual BPS
strings. We argue that this low-energy theory is a two-dimensional N = 4
supersymmetric sigma model.
