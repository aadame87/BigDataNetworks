  In this thesis we review the fundamental framework of boundary string field
theory (BSFT) and apply it to the tachyon condensation on non-BPS systems in
the superstring theory. The boundary string field theory can be regarded as a
natural extension of the nonlinear sigma model. By using this theory we can
describe the tachyon condensation exactly and also obtain the effective actions
on non-BPS systems consisting of the Dirac-Born-Infeld type action and the
Wess-Zumino type action. Especially the Wess-Zumino action is written by
superconnection and coincides with the mathematical argument by K-theory.
Moreover we also discuss the tachyon condensation keeping the conformal
invariance (on-shell). The exact argument by using the boundary state formalism
gives a good support to the conjecture of the tachyon condensation and it is
also consistent with boundary string field theory.
