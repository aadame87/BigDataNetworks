Title: Classes of exact wavefunctions for general time-dependent Dirac
  Hamiltonians in 1+1 dimensions
Authors: A. S. de Castro and A. de Souza Dutra
\\
  In this work we construct two classes of exact solutions for the most general
time-dependent Dirac Hamiltonian in 1+1 dimensions. Some problems regarding to
some formal solutions in the literature are discussed. Finally the existence of
a generalized Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant connected with such solutions is
discussed.
