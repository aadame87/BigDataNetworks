  In this second of a series of articles, a pair of quantized free oscillators
is transformed into a resonant system of coupled oscillators by analytic
continuation which is performed algebraically by the group of complex
symplectic transformations, creating dynamical representations of numerous
semi-groups from the Hamiltonian free system. The free oscillators are the
quantum analogue of action angle variable solutions for the coupled oscillators
and quantum resonances, including Breit-Wigner resonances. Among the
exponentially decaying Breit-Wigner resonances are hamiltonian systems in which
energy transfers from one oscillator to the other. There are significant
mathematical constraints in order that complex spectra be accommodate in a well
defined formalism, which may be met by using the commutative real algebra $\C
(1,i)$ as the ring of scalars in place of the field of complex numbers. By
including distributional solutions to the Schr{\"o}dinger equation, placing us
in a rigged Hilbert space, and by using the Hamiltonian as a generator of
canonical transformation of the space of states, the Schr{\"o}dinger equation
is the equation for parallel transport of generalized energy eigenvectors,
explicitly establishing the Hamiltonian as the generator of dynamical time
translations in this formalism. The space of states is explicitly constructed
using a realization of the Lie algebra of the group of dynamical
transformations as connections.
