  We propose a new Doubly Special Relativity theory based on the generalization
of the $\kappa$-deformation of the Poincar\'e algebra acting along one of the
null directions. We recall the full quantum algebra (Hopf) structure of such
deformed Poincar\'e algebra and use it to derive the (deformed) phase space
algebra. As in the DSR based on the standard quantum $\kappa$-Poincar\'e
algebra we find that the space time is non-commutative. We investigate the fate
of the properties of Special Relativity in the null basis: the split of the
algebra of Lorentz and momentum generators into kinematical and dynamical
parts, the action of the kinematical boost $M^{+-}$, and the emergence of the
two dimensional Galilean symmetry.
