  Thirty years ago, Coleman proved that no continuous symmetry is broken
spontaneously in a two-dimensional relativistic quantum field theory. In his
argument, however, it is difficult to understand the physical meaning of the
assumption of no infrared divergence. I derive the same result directly from
the cluster property of a local field regarded as a physically acceptable
assumption.
