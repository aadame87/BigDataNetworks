  We compute the corrections to heterotic-string backgrounds with (2,0)
world-sheet supersymmetry, up to two loops in sigma-model perturbation theory.
We investigate the conditions for these backgrounds to preserve spacetime
supersymmetry and we find that a sufficient requirement for consistency is the
applicability of the $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. In particular, we
investigate the $\alpha'$ corrections to (2,0) heterotic-string
compactifications and we find that the Calabi-Yau geometry of the internal
space is deformed to a Hermitian one. We show that at first order in $\alpha'$,
the heterotic anomaly-cancellation mechanism does not induce any lifting of
moduli. We explicitly compute the corrections to the conifold and to the
U(n)-invariant Calabi-Yau metric at first order in $\alpha'$. We also find a
generalization of the gauge-field equations, compatible with the Donaldson
equations on conformally-balanced Hermitian manifolds.
