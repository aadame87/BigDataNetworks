  By combining the concepts of graviton and matroid, we outline a new
gravitational theory which we call gravitoid theory. The idea of this theory
emerged as an attempt to link the mathematical structure of matroid theory with
M-theory. Our observations are essentially based on the formulation of matroid
bundle due to MacPherson and Anderson. Also, by considering the oriented
matroid theory, we add new observations about the link between the Fano matroid
and D=11 supergravity which was discussed in some of our recent papers. In
particular we find a connection between the affine matroid AG(3,2) and the $G_
{2}-$symmetry of D=11 supergravity.
