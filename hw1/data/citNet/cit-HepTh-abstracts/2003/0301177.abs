  It is argued that a phenomenologically viable grand unification model from
superstring is $SU(3)^3$, the simplest gauge group among the grand unifications
of the electroweak hypercharge embedded in semi-simple groups. We construct a
realistic 4D $SU(3)^3$ model with the GUT scale $\sin^2\theta_W^0= \frac38$ in
a $Z_3$ orbifold with Wilson line(s). By two GUT scale vacuum expectation
values, we obtain a rank 4 supersymmetric standard model below the GUT scale,
and predict three more strange families.
