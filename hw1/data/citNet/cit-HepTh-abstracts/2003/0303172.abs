  Using S(pacelike)-branes defined through rolling tachyon solutions, we show
how the dynamical formation of D(irichlet)-branes and strings in tachyon
condensation can be understood. Specifically we present solutions of S-brane
actions illustrating the classical confinement of electric and magnetic flux
into fundamental strings and D-branes. The role of S-branes in string theory is
further clarified and their RR charges are discussed. In addition, by examining
``boosted'' S-branes, we find what appears to be a surprising dual S-brane
description of strings and D-branes, which also indicates that the critical
electric field can be considered as a self-dual point in string theory. We also
introduce new tachyonic S-branes as Euclidean counterparts to non-BPS branes.
