Title: Complex Multiplication Symmetry of Black Hole Attractors

  We show how Moore's observation, in the context of toroidal compactifications
in type IIB string theory, concerning the complex multiplication structure of
black hole attractor varieties, can be generalized to Calabi-Yau
compactifications with finite fundamental groups. This generalization leads to
an alternative general framework in terms of motives associated to a Calabi-Yau
variety in which it is possible to address the arithmetic nature of the
attractor varieties in a universal way via Deligne's period conjecture.
