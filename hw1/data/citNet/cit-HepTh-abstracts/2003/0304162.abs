  Symmetry breaking can produce ``Alice'' strings, which alter scattered
charges and carry monopole number and charge when twisted into loops. We apply
recent topological results, fixing Alice strings' stability and prescribing
their twisting into loops with monopole charge, to several models. We show that
Alice strings of condensed matter systems (nematic liquid crystals, He-3A, and
related systems of non-chiral Bose condensates and amorphous chiral
superconductors) are topological, and carry fundamental monopole charge when
twisted into loops. Other models yield Alice loops that carry only deposited,
and not fundamental, charge.
