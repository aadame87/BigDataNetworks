Title: Solving matrix models using holomorphy

  We investigate the relationship between supersymmetric gauge theories with
moduli spaces and matrix models. Particular attention is given to situations
where the moduli space gets quantum corrected. These corrections are controlled
by holomorphy. It is argued that these quantum deformations give rise to
non-trivial relations for generalized resolvents that must hold in the
associated matrix model. These relations allow to solve a sector of the
associated matrix model in a similar way to a one-matrix model, by studying a
curve that encodes the generalized resolvents. At the level of loop equations
for the matrix model, the situations with a moduli space can sometimes be
considered as a degeneration of an infinite set of linear equations, and the
quantum moduli space encodes the consistency conditions for these equations to
have a solution.
