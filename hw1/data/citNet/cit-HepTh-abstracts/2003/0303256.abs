  This thesis is designed for a comprehensive review of noncommutative (BPS)
solitons with applications to D-brane dynamics including our works. We focus on
noncommutative instantons and monopoles and study various aspects of the exact
solutions by using Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin (ADHM) and Nahm constructions.
Finally we propose noncommutative extensions of integrable systems and soliton
theories in lower dimensions in collaboration with Kouichi Toda, which would
pioneer a new study area of integrable systems. Appendix is devoted to a brief
and systematic review of formal aspects of ADHM/Nahm construction and Nahm
transformation on commutative spaces. This article is also a step to a
comprehensive review of ADHM/Nahm construction on both commutative and
noncommutative spaces. Comments are welcome.
