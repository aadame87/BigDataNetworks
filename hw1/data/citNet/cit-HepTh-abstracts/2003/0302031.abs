Title: On the Q-Ball Profile Function
Authors: T.A. Ioannidou and N.D. V1achos
Comments: 7 pages + 2 figures
\\
  We use analytic and numerical methods to obtain the solution of the Q-ball
equation of motion. In particular, we show that the profile function of the
three-dimensional Q-ball can be accurately approximated by the symmetrized
Woods-Saxon distribution.
