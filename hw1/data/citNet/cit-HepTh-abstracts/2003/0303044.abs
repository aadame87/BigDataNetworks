  In an earlier paper, we showed that the causal boundary of any homogeneous
plane wave satisfying the weak energy condition consists of a single null line.
For conformally flat plane waves such as the Penrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5, all
spacelike curves that reach infinity also end on this boundary and the
completion is Hausdorff. However, the more generic case (including, e.g., the
Penrose limits of AdS_4 x S^7 and AdS_7 x S^4) is more complicated. In one
natural topology, not all spacelike curves have limit points in the causal
completion, indicating the need to introduce additional points at `spacelike
infinity'--the endpoints of spacelike curves. We classify the distinct ways in
which spacelike curves can approach infinity, finding a two-dimensional set of
distinct limits. The dimensionality of the set of points at spacelike infinity
is not, however, fixed from this argument. In an alternative topology, the
causal completion is already compact, but the completion is non-Hausdorff.
