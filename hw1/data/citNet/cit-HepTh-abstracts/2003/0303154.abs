  We present a class of scalar field cosmologies with a dynamically evolving
Newton parameter $G$ and cosmological term $\Lambda$. In particular, we discuss
a class of solutions which are consistent with a renormalization group scaling
for $G$ and $\Lambda$ near a fixed point. Moreover, we propose a modified
action for gravity which includes the effective running of $G$ and $\Lambda$
near the fixed point.
