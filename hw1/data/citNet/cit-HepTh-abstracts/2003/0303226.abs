Title: Fermion propagator for QED_3 in the IR domain
Authors: C.D. Fosco, A. Lopez
Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX; typo corrected in Eq.37
\\
  We evaluate the fermion propagator in parity-conserving QED_3 with N
flavours, in the context of an IR domain approximation. This provides results
which are non-perturbative in the loopwise expansion sense. We include
fermion-loop effects, and show that they are relevant to the chiral symmetry
breaking phenomenon, that can be understood in this context.
