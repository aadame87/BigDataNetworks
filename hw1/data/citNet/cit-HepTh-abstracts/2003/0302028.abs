  BPS wall solutions are obtained for N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model
with Eguchi-Hanson target manifold in a manifestly supersymmetric manner. The
model is constructed by a massive hyper-Kahler quotient method both in the N=1
superfield and in the N=2 superfield (harmonic superspace). We describe the
model in simple terms and give relations between various parameterizations
which are useful to describe the model and the solution. Some more details can
be found in our previous paper [hep-th/0211103]. This article is dedicated to
Professor Hiroshi Ezawa on the occasion of his seventieth birthday.
