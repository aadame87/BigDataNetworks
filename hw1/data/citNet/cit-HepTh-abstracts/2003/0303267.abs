\\
  By combining two distinct renormalization group transformations, opposing
scale transformations, we obtain a composite transformation which does not
rescale the system, and drives it to a "geometrical" fixed point, controlling
the effective geometry and locality. The latticized (deconstructed) action for
an extra-dimensional field theory becomes a ``perfect action,'' with a linear
ladder spectrum for N KK-modes.
