  We use the Konishi anomaly equations to construct the exact effective
superpotential of the glueball superfields in various N=1 supersymmetric gauge
theories. We use the superpotentials to study in detail the structure of the
spaces of vacua of these theories. We consider chiral and non-chiral SU(N)
models, the exceptional gauge group G(2) and models that break supersymmetry
dynamically.
