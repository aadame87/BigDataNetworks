  The modular invariance of the one-loop partition function of the closed
bosonic string in four dimensions in the presence of general time independent
exact pp-wave background is studied. In the absence of an axion field the
partition function is found to be modular invariant. In the presence of an
axion field modular invariace is broken. This can be attributed to the
light-cone gauge which breaks the symmetry in the $\sigma$-, $t$-directions.
