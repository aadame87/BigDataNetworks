Title: Can black holes have Euclidean cores?

  The search for regular black hole solutions in classical gravity leads us to
consider a core of Euclidean signature in the interior of a black hole.
Solutions of Lorentzian and Euclidean general relativity match in such a way
that energy densities and pressures of an isotropic perfect fluid form are
everywhere finite and continuous. Although the weak energy condition cannot be
satisfied for these solutions in general relativity, it can be when higher
derivative terms are added. A numerical study shows how the transition becomes
smoother in theories with more derivatives. As an alternative to the Euclidean
core, we also discuss a closely related time dependent orbifold construction
with a smooth space-like boundary inside the horizon.
