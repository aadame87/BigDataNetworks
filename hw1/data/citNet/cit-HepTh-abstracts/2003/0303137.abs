Title: Symmetries within domain walls
Authors: Tanmay Vachaspati
Comments: 5 pages. Added references

  The comparison of symmetries in the interior and the exterior of a domain
wall is relevant when discussing the correspondence between domain walls and
branes, and also when studying the interaction of walls and magnetic monopoles.
I discuss the symmetries in the context of an SU(N) times Z_2 model (for odd N)
with a single adjoint scalar field. Situations in which the wall interior has
less symmetry than the vacuum are easy to construct while the reverse situation
requires significant engineering of the scalar potential.
