Title: Quantization via Star Products

  We study quantization via star products. We pursue a quantization scheme,
where a quantum theory is described entirely in terms of the function space
without any reference to operators in the Hilbert space. For consistency of the
theory, the associativity law plays the essential role in excluding the
unwanted solutions to the stargen-value equation. This is exhibited in the
$D$-dimensional harmonic oscillator explicitly. As the by-products, the
interplay between the Laguerre polynomials and the creation and annihilation
functions with the star product is demonstrated.
