Title: Note on Seiberg Duality in Matrix Model
Authors: Bo Feng
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  In this note, we give a method to derive the Seiberg duality by the matrix
model. The key fact we used is that the effective actions given by matrix model
method should be identical for both electric and magnetic theories. We
demonstrate our method for SQCD with U(N), SO(N) and Sp(N) gauge groups.
