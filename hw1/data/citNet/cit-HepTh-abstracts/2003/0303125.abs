  Brane-induced gravity in five dimensions (Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati model)
exhibits modification of gravity at ultra-large distances, $r\gg r_c =
M_{Pl}^2/M^3$ where $M$ is the five-dimensional gravity scale. This makes the
model potentially interesting for explaining the observed acceleration of the
Universe. We argue, however, that it has an intrinsic intermediate energy scale
$(M^9/M_{Pl}^4)^{1/5}$. At higher energies, the model is strongly coupled. For
$r_c$ of order of the present Hubble size, the strong coupling regime occurs at
distanced below tens of metres.
