Title: Energy-Charge Dependence for Q-Balls
Authors: T.A. Ioannidou, V.B. Kopeliovich and N.D. Vlachos
Comments: 11 pages + 3 figures

  We show that many numerically established properties of Q-balls can be
understood in terms of analytic approximations for a certain type of potential.
In particular, we derive an explicit formula between the energy and the charge
of the Q-ball valid for a wide range of the charge Q.
