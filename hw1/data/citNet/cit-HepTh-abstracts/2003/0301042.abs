  We investigate the previously proposed cyclic regime of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless renormalization group (RG) flows. The period of one cycle
is computed in terms of the RG invariant. Mapping this theory to the
sine-Gordon model, we conjecture a particle spectrum and S-matrix. The S-matrix
has an infinite number of resonances with masses that have a Russian doll
scaling behavior that is consistent with the period of the RG cycles computed
from the beta-function. Closure of the bootstrap for the S-matrix leads to an
infinite number of particles of higher spin with a mass formula suggestive of a
string theory.
