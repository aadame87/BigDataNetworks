Title: The Cardy-Verlinde formula and entropy of Topological Kerr-Newman black
  holes in de Sitter spaces

  In this paper we show that the entropy of cosmological horizon in
4-dimensional Topological Kerr-Newman-de Sitter spaces can be described by the
Cardy-Verlinde formula, which is supposed to be an entropy formula of conformal
field theory in any dimension. Furthermore, we find that the entropy of black
hole horizon can also be rewritten in terms of the Cardy-Verlinde formula for
these black holes in de Sitter spaces, if we use the definition due to Abbott
and Deser for conserved charges in asymptotically de Sitter spaces. Such result
presume a well-defined dS/CFT correspondence, which has not yet attained the
credibility of its AdS analogue.
