Title: Remark About dS/CFT Correspondence
Authors: J.Kluson
Comments: 21 pages, some references added
\\
  In this paper we will study some aspects of dS/CFT correspondence. We will
focus on the relation between Witten's non-standard de Sitter inner product and
correlators in the holographic dual conformal field theory. We will argue that
from the definition of Witten's inner product and conjecture that the Hilbert
space of initial states of massive scalar field on $\mathcal{I}^-$ in de Sitter
space corresponds to the Hilbert space of states of Euclidean CFT on
$\mathcal{I}^-$, we can obtain CFT correlators in any vacuum state.
