  The problem of constructing gauge invariant currents in terms of light-cone
bound-state wave functions is solved by utilising the gauging of equations
method. In particular, it is shown how to construct perturbative expansions of
the electromagnetic current in the light-cone formalism, such that current
conservation is satisfied at each order of the perturbation theory.
