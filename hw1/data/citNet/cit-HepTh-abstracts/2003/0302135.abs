  Supersymmetric non-linear sigma-models are described by a field dependent
Kaehler metric determining the kinetic terms. In general it is not guaranteed
that this metric is always invertible. Our aim is to investigate the symmetry
structure of supersymmetric models in four dimensional space-time in which
metric singularities occur. For this purpose we study a simple anomaly-free
extension of the supersymmetric CP^1 model from a classical point of view. We
show that the metric singularities can be regularized by the addition of a soft
supersymmetry-breaking mass parameter.
