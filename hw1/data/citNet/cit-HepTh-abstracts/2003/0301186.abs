  The thermodynamics of type IIB superstring theory in the maximally
supersymmetric plane wave background is studied. We compute the thermodynamic
partition function for non-interacting strings exactly and the result differs
slightly from previous computations. We clarify some of the issues related to
the Hagedorn temperature in the limits of small and large constant RR 5-form.
We study the thermodynamic behavior of strings in the case of $AdS_3 \times S^3
\times T^4$ geometries in the presence of NS-NS and RR 3-form backgrounds. We
also comment on the relationship of string thermodynamics and the thermodynamic
behavior of the sector of Yang-Mills theory which is the holographic dual of
the string theory.
