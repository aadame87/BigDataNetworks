  We incorporate running parameters and anomalous dimensions into the framework
of the exact renormalization group. We modify the exact renormalization group
differential equations for a real scalar field theory, using the anomalous
dimensions of the squared mass and the scalar field. Following a previous paper
in which an integral equation approach to the exact renormalization group was
introduced, we reformulate the modified differential equations as integral
equations that define the continuum limit directly in terms of a running
squared mass and self-coupling constant. Universality of the continuum limit
under an arbitrary change of the momentum cutoff function is discussed using
the modified exact renormalization group equations.
