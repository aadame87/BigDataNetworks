Title: Many-Body Superconformal Systems from Hamiltonian Reductions

  We propose a new variant of the Hamiltonian reduction for constructing
n-particle (super)conformal theories in one dimension starting from a direct
sum of (n-1)n/2+1 (super)conformal mechanics. As an application we explicitly
build N=4 superconformal Calogero-type models both in superfields and in
components.
