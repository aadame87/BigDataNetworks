  We discuss properties of a 4-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in a
spacetime where one of the spatial dimensions is compactified. As a result of
the compactification the event horizon of the black hole is distorted. We use
Weyl coordinates to obtain the solution describing such a distorted black hole.
We study the properties of the compactified Schwarzschild black hole, and
develop an approximation which allows one to find the size, shape, surface
gravity and other characteristics of the distorted horizon with a very high
accuracy in a simple analytical form. We also discuss possible instabilities of
a black hole in the compactified space.
