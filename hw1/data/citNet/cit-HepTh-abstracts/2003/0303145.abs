  The field equations of the auxiliary fields are nonlinear and free of
derivatives. Hence, it is argued, a Legendre transform to generate the 1PI
Generating Functionals is not correct for the auxiliary fields. A corrected
formulation of the BRS symmetry must be constructed by integrating the
auxiliary fields. This necessarily destroys manifest supersymmetry. It also
generates a new "Physical BRS-ZJ" cohomology problem. The resulting "Physical
BRS-ZJ cohomology" is then described. The cohomology contains a rich spectrum
of potential supersymmetry anomalies in certain composite operators that have
spinor indices. Some examples of these composite operators are set out
explicitly. The examples depend on certain Constraint Equations that arise from
simple Generating Functions. The Constraint Equations constrain the mass and
Yukawa coefficients of the theory. The potential supersymmetry anomalies have
calculable one-loop coefficients that depend on the solutions to the Constraint
Equations. If these coefficients are non-zero, the anomalies will then
necessarily break supersymmetry with a calculable pattern, probably with a zero
cosmological constant.
