  The 7--particle form factors of the fundamental spin field of the O(3)
nonlinear $\sigma$--model are constructed. We calculate the corresponding
contribution to the spin--spin correlation function, and compare with
predictions from the spectral density scaling hypothesis. The resulting
approximation to the spin--spin correlation function agrees well with that
computed in renormalized (asymptotically free) perturbation theory in the
expected energy range. Further we observe simple lower and upper bounds for the
sum of the absolute square of the form factors which may be of use for analytic
estimates.
