  Bousso's entropy bound for two-dimensional gravity is investigated in the
lightcone gauge. It is shown that due to the Weyl anomaly, the null component
of the energy-momentum tensor takes a nonvanishing value, and thus, combined
with the conditions that were recently proposed by Bousso, Flanagan and Marolf,
a holographic entropy bound similar to Bousso's is expected to hold in two
dimensions. A connection of our result to that of Strominger and Thompson is
also discussed.
