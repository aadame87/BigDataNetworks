  We first review the Stueckelberg field in the massive Abelian gauge theory.
We then extend this idea to the standard model, stueckelberging the hypercharge
U(1) and thus giving a mass to the photon. This introduces an infrared
regulator for the photon in the standard electroweak theory, along with a
modification of the Weinberg angle accompanied by a plethora of new effects.
Finally, we review the historical influence of Stueckelberg's 1938 idea, which
led notably to the discovery of the Higgs mechanism in spontaneous symmetry
breaking as the only presently known way to give masses to non-Abelian vector
fields.
