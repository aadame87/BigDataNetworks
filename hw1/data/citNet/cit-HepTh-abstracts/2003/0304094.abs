  Four dimensional N=2 supergravity has regular, stationary, asymptotically
flat BPS solutions with intrinsic angular momentum, describing bound states of
separate extremal black holes with mutually nonlocal charges. Though the
existence and some properties of these solutions were established some time
ago, fully explicit analytic solutions were lacking thus far. In this note, we
fill this gap. We show in general that explicit solutions can be constructed
whenever an explicit formula is known in the theory at hand for the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a single black hole as a function of its charges,
and illustrate this with some simple examples. We also give an example of
moduli-dependent black hole entropy.
