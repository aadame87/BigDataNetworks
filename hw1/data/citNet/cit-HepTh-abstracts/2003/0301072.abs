  We compute the cosmological perturbations generated in the brane world
inflation driven by the bulk inflaton. Different from the model that the
inflation is a brane effect, we exhibit the modification of the power spectrum
of scalar perturbations due to the existence of the fifth dimension. With the
change of the initial vacuum, we investigate the dependence of the correction
of the power spectrum on the choice of the vacuum.
