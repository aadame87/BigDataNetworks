  For models with several time-dependent components generalized entropies can
be defined. This is shown for the Bianchi type IX model. We first derive the
Cardy-Verlinde formula under the assumption that the first law of
thermodynamics is valid. This leads to an explicit expression of the total
entropy associated with this type of universes. Assuming the validity of the
Cardy entropy formula, we obtain expressions for the corresponding Bekenstein,
Bekenstein-Hawking and Hubble entropies. We discuss the validity of the
Cardy-Verlinde formula and possible extensions of the outlined procedure to
other time-dependent models.
