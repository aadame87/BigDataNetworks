  The alternating integrable spin chain and the $RSOS(q_{1},q_{2};p)$ model in
the presence of a quantum impurity are investigated. The boundary free energy
due to the impurity is derived, the ratios of the corresponding $g$ functions
at low and high temperature are specified and their relevance to boundary flows
in unitary minimal and generalized coset models is discussed. Finally, the
alternating spin chain with diagonal and non--diagonal integrable boundaries is
studied, and the corresponding boundary free energy and $g$ functions are
derived.
