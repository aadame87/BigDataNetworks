Title: On Non-Abelian Holonomies
Authors: J. Alfaro, H.A. Morales-T\'ecotl, M. Reyes and L.F. Urrutia
Comments: latex, 17 pages, 2 figures

  We provide a method and the results for the calculation of the holonomy of a
Yang-Mills connection in an arbitrary triangular path, in an expansion
(developed here to fifth order) in powers of the corresponding segments. The
results might have applications in generalizing to Yang-Mills fields previous
calculations of the corrections to particle dynamics induced by loop quantum
gravity, as well as in the field of random lattices.
