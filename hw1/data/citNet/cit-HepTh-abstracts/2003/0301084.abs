Title: The one-loop QED in Noncommutative space
Authors: Nguyen Tien Binh
Comments: 27pages,4figures
\\
  Returning to the old problems in ordinary QED, by an appropriate extension of
the dimensional regularization method in noncommutative space we try to provide
a quite coherent look into NCQED.The renormalisation of theories, the $\beta$
function,the vacuum polarisation of photon, the general structure of vertex
fermion-photon, the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of fermions and the
validity of Ward identity at the one-loop level are reinvestigated.
