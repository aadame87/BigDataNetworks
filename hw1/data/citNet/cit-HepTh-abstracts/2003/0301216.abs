  A Fermi ball is a kind of non-topological soliton, which is thought to arise
from the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $Z_2$ symmetry and to
contribute to cold dark matter. We consider a simple model in which fermion
fields with multi-flavors are coupled to a scalar field through Yukawa
coupling, and examine how the number of the fermion flavors affects the
stability of the Fermi ball against the fragmentation. (1)We find that the
Fermi ball is stable against the fragmentation in most cases even in the lowest
order thin-wall approximation. (2)We then find that in the other specific
cases, the stability is marginal in the lowest order thin-wall approximation,
and the next-to-leading order correction determines the stable region of the
coupling constants; We examine the simplest case where the total fermion number
$N_i$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $G_i$ of each flavor $i$ are common to
the flavor, and find that the Fermi ball is stable in the limited region of the
parameters and has the broader region for the larger number of the flavors.
