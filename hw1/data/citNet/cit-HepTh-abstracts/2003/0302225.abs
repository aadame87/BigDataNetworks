  We show that, contrary to common belief, the propagation of a spin-2 field in
an electromagnetic background is {\em causal}. The proof will be given in the
Fierz formalism which, as we shall see, is free of the ambiguity present in the
more usual Einstein representation. We shall also review the proof in this
latter representation.
