  We consider multidimensional gravitational models with a nonlinear scalar
curvature term and form fields in the action functional. In our scenario it is
assumed that the higher dimensional spacetime undergoes a spontaneous
compactification to a warped product manifold. Particular attention is paid to
models with quadratic scalar curvature terms and a Freund-Rubin-like ansatz for
solitonic form fields. It is shown that for certain parameter ranges the extra
dimensions are stabilized. In particular, stabilization is possible for any
sign of the internal space curvature, the bulk cosmological constant and of the
effective four-dimensional cosmological constant. Moreover, the effective
cosmological constant can satisfy the observable limit on the dark energy
density. Finally, we discuss the restrictions on the parameters of the
considered nonlinear models and how they follow from the connection between the
D-dimensional and the four-dimensional fundamental mass scales.
