  These notes comprise the second part of two articles devoted to the
construction of exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theory in two spacetime
dimensions. Here we shall deal with the quantum field theory. Topics covered
include an investigation of the symmetries of quantum gauge theory on the
noncommutative torus within the path integral formalism, the derivation of the
exact expression for the vacuum amplitude, and the classification of instanton
contributions. A section dealing with a new, exact combinatorial solution of
gauge theory on a two-dimensional fuzzy torus is also included.
