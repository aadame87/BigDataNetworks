Title: Correlators in Timelike Bulk Liouville Theory
Authors: Andrew Strominger and Tadashi Takayanagi
Comments: 10 pages, Latex
\\
  Liouville theory with a negative norm boson and no screening charge
corresponds to an exact classical solution of closed bosonic string theory
describing time-dependent bulk tachyon condensation. A simple expression for
the two point function is proposed based on renormalization/analytic
continuation of the known results for the ordinary (positive-norm) Liouville
theory. The expression agrees exactly with the minisuperspace result for the
closed string pair-production rate (which diverges at finite time). Puzzles
concerning the three-point function are presented and discussed.
