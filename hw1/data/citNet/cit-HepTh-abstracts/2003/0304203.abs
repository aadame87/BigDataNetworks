Title: CMB Power Spectrum from Noncommutative Spacetime
Authors: Qing-Guo Huang and Miao Li
Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures
\\
  Very recent CMB data of WMAP offers an opportunity to test inflation models,
in particular, the running of spectral index is quite new and can be used to
rule out some models. We show that an noncommutative spacetime inflation model
gives a good explanation of these new results. In fitting the data, we also
obtain a relationship between the noncommutative parameter (string scale) and
the ending time of inflation.
