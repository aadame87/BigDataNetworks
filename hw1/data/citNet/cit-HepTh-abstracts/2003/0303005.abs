Title: Must a Hamiltonian be Hermitian?

  A consistent physical theory of quantum mechanics can be built on a complex
Hamiltonian that is not Hermitian but instead satisfies the physical condition
of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry). Thus, there are infinitely
many new Hamiltonians that one can construct that might explain experimental
data. One would think that a quantum theory based on a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian violates unitarity. However, if PT symmetry is not broken, it is
possible to use a previously unnoticed physical symmetry of the Hamiltonian to
construct an inner product whose associated norm is positive definite. This
construction is general and works for any PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. The
dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. This formulation does not
conflict with the requirements of conventional quantum mechanics. There are
many possible observable and experimental consequences of extending quantum
mechanics into the complex domain, both in particle physics and in solid state
physics.
