\\
  Moduli spaces of conformal field theories corresponding to current-current
deformations are discussed. For WZW models, CFT and sigma model considerations
are compared. It is shown that current-current deformed WZW models have
WZW-like sigma model descriptions with non-bi-invariant metrics, additional
B-fields and a non-trivial dilaton.
