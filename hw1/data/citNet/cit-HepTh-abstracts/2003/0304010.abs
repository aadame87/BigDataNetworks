  accelerated observer

  With a special choice of gauge the operator of the Klein-Fock-Gordon equation
in homogeneous electric field respects boost symmetry. Using this symmetry we
obtain solutions for the scalar massive field equation in such a background
(boost modes in the electric field). We calculate the spectrum of particles
created by the electric field, as seen by an accelerated observer at spatial
infinity of the right wedge of Minkowski spacetime. It is shown that the
spectrum and the total number of created pairs measured by a remote uniformly
accelerated observer in Minkowski spacetime are precisely the same as for
inertial observers.
