  We discuss a formulation of quantum field theory on quantum space time where
the perturbation expansion of the S-matrix is term by term ultraviolet finite.
  The characteristic feature of our approach is a quantum version of the Wick
product at coinciding points: the differences of coordinates q_j - q_k are not
set equal to zero, which would violate the commutation relation between their
components. We show that the optimal degree of approximate coincidence can be
defined by the evaluation of a conditional expectation which replaces each
function of q_j - q_k by its expectation value in optimally localized states,
while leaving the mean coordinates (q_1 + ... + q_n)/n invariant.
  The resulting procedure is to a large extent unique, and is invariant under
translations and rotations, but violates Lorentz invariance. Indeed, optimal
localization refers to a specific Lorentz frame, where the electric and
magnetic parts of the commutator of the coordinates have to coincide*).
  Employing an adiabatic switching, we show that the S-matrix is term by term
finite. The matrix elements of the transfer matrix are determined, at each
order in the perturbative expansion, by kernels with Gaussian decay in the
Planck scale. The adiabatic limit and the large scale limit of this theory will
be studied elsewhere.
