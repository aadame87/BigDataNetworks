  We study partially supersymmetric plane-wave like deformations of string
theories and M-theory on brane backgrounds. These deformations are dual to
nonlocal field theories. We calculate various expectation values of
configurations of closed as well as open Wilson loops and Wilson surfaces in
those theories. We also discuss the manifestation of the nonlocality structure
in the supergravity backgrounds. A plane-wave like deformation of little string
theory has also been studied.
