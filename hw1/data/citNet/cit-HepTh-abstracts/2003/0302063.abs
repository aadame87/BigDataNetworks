  We argue that the AdS dual of the three dimensional critical O(N) vector
model can be evaluated using the Legendre transform that relates the generating
functionals of the free UV and the interacting IR fixed points of the boundary
theory. As an example, we use our proposal to evaluate the minimal bulk action
of the scalar field that it dual to the spin-zero ``current'' of the O(N)
vector model. We find that the cubic bulk self interaction coupling vanishes.
We briefly discuss the implications of our results for higher spin theories and
comment on the bulk-boundary duality for subleading N.
