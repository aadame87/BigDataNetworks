  Hydrodynamic fluctuations at non-zero temperature can cause slow relaxation
toward equilibrium even in observables which are not locally conserved. A
classic example is the stress-stress correlator in a normal fluid, which, at
zero wavenumber, behaves at large times as t^{-3/2}. A novel feature of the
effective theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations in supersymmetric theories is the
presence of Grassmann-valued classical fields describing macroscopic
supercharge density fluctuations. We show that hydrodynamic fluctuations in
supersymmetric theories generate essentially the same long-time power-law tails
in real-time correlation functions that are known in simple fluids. In
particular, a t^{-3/2} long-time tail must exist in the stress-stress
correlator of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at non-zero temperature,
regardless of the value of the coupling. Consequently, this feature of
finite-temperature dynamics can provide an interesting test of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. However, the coefficient of this long-time tail is suppressed
by a factor of 1/N_c^2. On the gravitational side, this implies that these
long-time tails are not present in the classical supergravity limit; they must
instead be produced by one-loop gravitational fluctuations.
