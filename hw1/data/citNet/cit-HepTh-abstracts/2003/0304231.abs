  We study the wave equation for a massive scalar field in three-dimensional
AdS (anti de Sitter) and dS (de Sitter) spaces to find what is the difference
and similarity between two spaces. Here the AdS space is provided by the BTZ
black hole with J=0. To investigate its event (cosmological) horizons, we
compute the absorption cross section, quasinormal modes, and study the
AdS(dS)/CFT correspondences. Although there remains an unclear point in
defining the ingoing flux near infinity of the BTZ black hole, quasinormal
modes are obtained and the AdS/CFT correspondence is confirmed. However, we do
not find quasinormal modes and thus do not confirm the assumed dS/CFT
correspondence. This difference in the scalar wave propagation between AdS and
dS spaces is very interesting, because their global structures are similar to
each other.
