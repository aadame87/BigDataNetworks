  We examine the possibility of rolling tachyon to play the dual roll of
inflaton at early epochs and dark matter at late times. We argue that enough
inflation can be generated with the rolling tachyon either by invoking the
large number of branes or brane world assisted inflation. However, reheating is
problematic in this model.
