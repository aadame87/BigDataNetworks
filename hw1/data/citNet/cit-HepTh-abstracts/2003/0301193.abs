Title: Recent progresses on Liouville Field Theory
Authors: Benedicte Ponsot
Comments: 28 pages. More or less the English version of the author's PhD thesis
  (in French) held at Montpellier University, May 2000. Adviser:

  proceedings of the 6th International Conference on CFTs and Integrable
  Models, Chernogolovka, Russia, September 2002
\\
  An explicit construction for the monodromy of the Liouville conformal blocks
in terms of Racah-Wigner coefficients of U_q(sl(2,R)) is proposed. As a direct
consequence, the expression for the correlator of three boundary operators is
obtained.
