  We study dynamics of rolling tachyon and Abelian gauge field on unstable
D-branes, of which effective action is given by Born-Infeld type nonlocal
action. Possible cosmological evolutions are also discussed. In the Einstein
frame of string cosmology, every expanding flat universe is proven to be
decelerating.
