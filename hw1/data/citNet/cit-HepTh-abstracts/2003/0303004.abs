Title: Comment on Geometric Interpretation of Ito Calculus on the Lattice
Authors: Naohito Nakazawa
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  A covariant nature of the Langevin equation in Ito calculus is clarified in
applying stochastic quantization method to U(N) and SU(N) lattice gauge
theories. The stochastic process is expressed in a manifestly general
coordinate covariant form as a collective field theory on the group manifold. A
geometric interpretation is given for the Langevin equation and the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation in the sense of Ito.
