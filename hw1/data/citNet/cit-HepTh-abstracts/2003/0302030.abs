  We investigate the dynamics of a spherically symmetric 3-brane world in the
Randall-Sundrum scenario by taking the point of view of a 5-dimensional
observer. To analyze the Einstein equations in the presence of matter fields in
the bulk, we employ a global conformal transformation whose factor
characterizes the $Z_2$ symmetric warp. For a certain kind of conformal
stress-energy tensor and if the warp factor depends only on the fifth
dimension, we find a new set of exact dynamical collapse solutions which
localize gravity in the vicinity of the brane. Geometries inducing the brane
world dynamics of inhomogeneous dust and generalized dark radiation are shown
to belong to this set. The conditions for singular or globally regular behavior
and the static marginally bound limits are discussed for these examples. Also
explicitly demonstrated is the complete consistency with the effective point of
view of a 4-dimensional observer who is confined to the brane and makes the
same assumptions about the bulk degrees of freedom.
