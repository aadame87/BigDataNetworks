  Unstable D-branes or brane-antibrane systems can decay to lower-dimensional
branes. In the effective field theory description, the final state branes are
defects in the tachyon field which describes the initial instability. We study
the dynamical formation of codimension one defects (kinks) using Sen's ansatz
for the tachyon Lagrangian. It is shown that the slope of the kink diverges
within a finite amount of time after the tachyon starts to roll. We discuss the
relevance for reheating after brane-antibrane inflation.
