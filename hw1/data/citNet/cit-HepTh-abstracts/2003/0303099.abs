Title: Mathisson' spinning electron: noncommutative mechanics & exotic Galilean
  symmetry, 66 years ago
Author: P. A. Horvathy
Comments: Final version, published in Acta Physica Polonica 34, 2611 (2003).
  Dedicated to the memory of M. Mathisson, J. Weyssenhoff and A. Raabe, who
  tried to continue to do research during those terrible years of World War II.
  Revised version. The relation with Schr\"odinger's Zitternde Elektron
  indicated, and Dirac's Obituary on Mathisson is added. Latex, no figures. 9
  pages

  The acceleration-dependent system with noncommuting coordinates, proposed by
Lukierski, Stichel and Zakrzewski [Ann. Phys. 260, 224 (1997)] is derived as
the non-relativistic limit of Mathisson's classical electron [Acta Physica
Polonica 6, 218 (1937)], further discussed by Weyssenhoff and Raabe [Acta
Physica Polonica 9, 7 (1947)]. The two-parameter centrally extended Galilean
symmetry of the model is recoved using elementary methods. The relation to
Schr\"odinger's Zitternde Elektron is indicated.
