  We construct supergravity solutions dual to microstates of the D1-D3-D5
system with nonzero B field moduli. Just like the D1-D5 solutions in
hep-th/0109154 these solutions are generically nonsingular everywhere, with the
`throat' closing smoothly near r=0. We write expressions relating the
asymptotic supergravity fields to the integral brane charges. We study the
infall of a D1 brane down the throat of the geometries. This test brane
`bounces' off the smooth end for generic initial conditions. The details of the
bounce depend on both the choice of D1-D3-D5 microstate and the direction of
approach of the infalling D1 brane. In the dual field theory description we see
that the tachyon mode starts to condense, but the tachyon bounces back up the
potential hill without reaching the deepest point of the potential.
