  Quarks and leptons charges and interactions are derived from gauge theories
associated with symmetries. Their space-time labels come from representations
of the non-compact algebra of Special Relativity. Common to these descriptions
are the Lie groups stemming from their invariances. Does Nature use Exceptional
Groups, the most distinctive among them? We examine the case for and against
their use. They do indeed appear in charge space, as the Standard Model fits
naturally inside the exceptional group $E_6$. Further, the advent of the
$E_8\times E_8$ Heterotic Superstring theory adds credibility to this venue. On
the other hand, their use as space-time labels has not been as evident as they
link spinors and tensors under space rotations, which flies in the face of the
spin-statistics connection. We discuss a way to circumvent this difficulty in
trying to generalize eleven-dimensional supergravity.
