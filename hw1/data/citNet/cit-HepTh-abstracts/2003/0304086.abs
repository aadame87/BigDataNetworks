  In the present article, we study the space-time geometry felt by probe
bosonic string moving in antisymmetric and dilaton background fields. This
space-time geometry we shall call the stringy geometry. In particular, the
presence of the antisymmetric field leads to the space-time torsion, and the
presence of the dilaton field leads to the space-time nonmetricity. We
generalize the geometry of surfaces embedded in space-time to the case when
torsion and nonmetricity are present. We define the mean extrinsic curvature
for Minkowski signature and introduce the concept of mean torsion. Its
orthogonal projection defines the dual mean extrinsic curvature. In this
language, one field equation is just the equality of mean extrinsic curvature
and dual mean extrinsic curvature, which we call self-duality relation. In the
torsion and nonmetricity free case, the world-sheet is a minimal surface,
specified by the requirement that mean extrinsic curvature vanishes. Generally,
it is stringy self-dual (anti self-dual) surface. In the presence of the
dilaton field, which breaks conformal invariance, the conformal factor which
connects intrinsic and induced metrics, is determined as a function of the
dilaton field itself. We also derive the integration measure for the space-time
with stringy nonmetricity.
