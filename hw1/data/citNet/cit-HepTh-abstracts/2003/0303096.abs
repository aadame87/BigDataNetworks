  We study solutions of Einstein's equations corresponding codimension n>2
global topological defects with de Sitter slices. We analyze a class of
solutions that are cylindrically symmetric and admit positive, negative or zero
bulk cosmological constant. We derive the relevant graviton equations. For an
extended brane, the properties of the solution depend on apropriate boundary
conditions that the exterior solutions have to satisfy near the core. As an
alternative we consider matching copies of the exterior solution related by
symmetry. We show that we can get localization only when the bulk cosmological
constant is negative. We obtain a condition on the global defect symmetry
breaking scale which ultimately controls the size of the n-1 internal
dimensions at the position of the brane. The induced metric on the brane, in
the case of mirror spacetimes, is a direct product of a de Sitter space and an
(n-1)-sphere, while the metric of the embedding spacetime is a warped product
and the actual size of the (n-1)-sphere changes as we move along the radial
direction. The solutions possess naked singularities, which nevertheless
satisfy no-flow conditions.
