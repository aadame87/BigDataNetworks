  A velocity of a point particle in the kappa-Minkowski spacetime is
investigated. Characteristic points of the spacetime are that the Poincare
group becomes a quantum group with kappa, which is a mass dimension parameter,
and is a kind of non-commutative geometry. We consider a particle in a
coordinate space instead of it in a momentum space which is discussed in many
articles. We see that the particle's velocity has an uncertainty which depends
on a length of particle's propagation.
