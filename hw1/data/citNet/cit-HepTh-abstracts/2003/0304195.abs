  We propose a useful method for deriving the effective theory for a system
where BPS and anti-BPS domain walls coexist. Our method respects an
approximately preserved SUSY near each wall. Due to the finite width of the
walls, SUSY breaking terms arise at tree-level, which are exponentially
suppressed. A practical approximation using the BPS wall solutions is also
discussed. We show that a tachyonic mode appears in the matter sector if the
corresponding mode function has a broader profile than the wall width.
