  The obstruction for a perturbative reconstruction of the five-dimensional
bulk metric starting from the four-dimensional metric at the boundary,that is,
the Dirichlet problem, is computed in dimensions $6\leq d\leq 10$ and some
comments are made on its general structure and, in particular, on its
relationship with the conformal anomaly, which we compute in dimension $d=8$.
