  In many high dimensional noncommutative theories, no state saturates
simultaneously all the non trivial Heisenberg uncertainty relations. This
differs from the usual theory where the squeezed states possess this property.
The important role played by these states when recovering classical mechanics
as a limit of quantum theory makes necessary the investigation of the possible
generalizations in the noncommutative context.
  We propose an extension based on a variational principle. The action
considered is the sum of the squares of the terms associated to the non trivial
Heisenberg uncertainty relations. We first verify that our proposal works in
the usual theory: we find the known gaussian functions and, besides them, other
states which can be expressed as products of gaussians with specific
hypergeometrics.
  We illustrate our construction in three models defined on a four dimensional
phase space: two models endowed with a minimal length uncertainty and the
popular case in which the commutators of the positions are constants. In these
three models, our proposal leads to second order partial differential
equations. We find analytical solutions in specific cases. We briefly discuss
how our method may be applied to the fuzzy sphere.
  To emphasize that the recovering of classical behaviours is not a trivial
question in the non commutative context, we show how the difference of
structure between the Poisson brackets and the commutators in the theories
analyzed here generically leads to a loss of periodicity for the harmonic
oscillator.
