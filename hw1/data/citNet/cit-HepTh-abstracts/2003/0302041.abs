  We analyse the physical boundary conditions at infinity for metric
fluctuations and gauge functions in the RS2 model with matter on the brane. We
argue that due to these boundary conditions the radion field cannot be gauged
out in this case. Thus, it represents a physical degree of freedom of the
model.
