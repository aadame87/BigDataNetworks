  We analyse possible cosmological scenarios on a brane where the brane acts as
a dynamical boundary of various black holes with anti-de Sitter or de Sitter
asymptotics. In many cases, the brane is found to describe completely
non-singular universe. In some cases, quantum gravity era of the brane-universe
can also be avoided by properly tuning bulk parameters. We further discuss the
creation of a brane-universe by studying its wave function. This is done by
employing Wheeler-De Witt equation in the mini superspace formalism.
