  We compute the two-body one-loop effective action for the matrix theory in
the pp-wave background, and compare it to the effective action on the
supergravity side in the same background. Agreement is found for the effective
actions on both sides. This points to the existence of a supersymmetric
nonrenormalization theorem in the pp-wave background.
