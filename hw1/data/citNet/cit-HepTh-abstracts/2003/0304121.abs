\\
  All consistent interactions in a three-dimensional theory with tensor gauge
fields of degrees two and three are obtained by means of the deformation of the
solution to the master equation combined with cohomological techniques. The
local BRST cohomology of this model allows the deformation of the Lagrangian
action, accompanying gauge symmetries and gauge algebra. The relationship with
the Chern--Simons theory is discussed.
