  We investigate the geometry of the matrix model associated with an N=1 super
Yang-Mills theory with three adjoint fields, which is a massive deformation of
N=4. We study in particular the Riemann surface underlying solutions with
arbitrary number of cuts. We show that an interesting geometrical structure
emerges where the Riemann surface is related on-shell to the Donagi-Witten
spectral curve. We explicitly identify the quantum field theory resolvents in
terms of geometrical data on the surface.
