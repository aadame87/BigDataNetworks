  In this paper the Seiberg-Witten map for a time-dependent background related
to a null-brane orbifold is studied. The commutation relations of the
coordinates are linear, i.e. it is an example of the Lie algebra type. The
equivalence map between the Kontsevich star product for this background and the
Weyl-Moyal star product for a background with constant noncommutativity
parameter is also studied.
