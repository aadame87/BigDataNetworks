Title: Evidence that highly non-uniform black strings have a conical waist
Authors: Barak Kol, Toby Wiseman
Comments: 7 pages

  Numerical methods have allowed the construction of vacuum non-uniform
strings. For sufficient non-uniformity, the local geometry about the minimal
horizon sphere (the "waist") was conjectured to be a cone metric. We are able
to test this conjecture explicitly giving strong evidence in favour of it. We
also show how to extend the conjecture to weakly charged strings.
