Title: Comments on Two-Loop Four-Particle Amplitude in Superstring Theory
Authors: Wu-Jun Bao, Chuan-Jie Zhu
Comments: 10 pages, Latex file
\\
  It is shown that the four-particle amplitude of superstring theory at two
loops obtained in [1,2] is equivalent to the previously obtained results in
[3,4,5]. Here the ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry in hyperelliptic Riemann surface plays
an important role in the proof.
