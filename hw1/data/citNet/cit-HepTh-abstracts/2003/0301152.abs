  We present an approach to the construction of Action Principles for first
order (in time derivatives) differential equations to construct systematically,
for integrable equations which are based on the existence of a Nijenhuis (or
hereditary) operator, a ladder of Action Principles which is complementary to
the well-known multi-Hamiltonian formulation. We work out results for the
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which is a member of the positive hierarchy
related to the hereditary operator. Three negative hierarchies of (negative)
evolution equations are defined naturally from the hereditary operator as well,
in a concise way, suitable for field theory. We identify the Liouville,
Sinh-Gordon, Hunter-Zheng and Camassa-Holm equations as negative ones. The same
multi-Lagrangian scheme for KdV is shown to apply also to these and other
positive and negative evolution equations. The Euler-Lagrange equations arising
from the Action Principles are equivalent to deformations of the original
evolution equation, and the deformations are obtained explicitly in terms of
the positive and negative evolution vectors. For example, Action Principles for
KdV which are time-reparametrization invariant are constructed, and a new
Action Principle for the deformed system Sinh-Gordon + spatial translation
vector is presented. The factorized hereditary operator allows for the explicit
computation of local and nonlocal Hamiltonian operators, as the inverses of all
the symplectic 2-forms in the ladder. Nonlocal constants of the motion are
constructed for KdV as well as for positive and negative vectors, in a concise
way. Alternative Lax pairs for all negative vectors are constructed. Some
results are mapped to the Krichever-Novikov and Harry-Dym equations.
