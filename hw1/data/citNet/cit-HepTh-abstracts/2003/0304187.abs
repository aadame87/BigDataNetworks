  We discuss a model in which high energy brane corrections allow a single
scalar field to describe inflation at early epochs and quintessence at late
times. The reheating mechanism in the model originates from Born-Infeld matter
whose energy density mimics cosmological constant at very early times and
manifests itself as radiation subsequently. For most of the inflationary
evolution the Born-Infeld matter remains subdominant to the the scalar field.
Shortly before the end of inflation driven by the scalar field, the energy
density of Born-Infeld matter starts scaling as radiation and drops by several
orders of magnitudes at the epoch inflation ends. The problem of over
production of gravity wave background in scenarios based upon reheating through
gravitational particle production is successfully resolved by suitably fixing
the initial value of radiation energy density at the end of inflation. No
additional fine tuning of the parameters is required for a viable evolution.
