Title: Low Level Representations for E10 and E11
Authors: Hermann Nicolai, Thomas Fischbacher
Comments: 40 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables. Contribution to the Proceedings of the
  Ramanujan International Symposium on Kac-Moody Algebras and Applications,
  ISKMAA-2002, Jan. 28--31, Chennai,India. More data than given in the paper
  for E10 root multiplicities up to height 320, E10 decompositions up to level
  28, and for E11 are included in the arXiv upload

  We work out the decomposition of the indefinite Kac Moody algebras ${E_{10}}$
and ${E_{11}}$ w.r.t. their respective subalgebras $A_9$ and $A_{10}$ at low
levels. Tables of the irreducible representations with their outer
multiplicities are presented for ${E_{10}}$ up to level $\ell = 18$ and for
${E_{11}}$ up to level $\ell =10$. On the way we confirm and extend existing
results for ${E_{10}}$ root multiplicities, and for the first time compute
non-trivial root multiplicities of ${E_{11}}$.
