Title: String theory in Lorentz-invariant light cone gauge - II
Authors: Igor Nikitin, Lialia Nikitina
\\
  We perform a quantization of 4-dimensional Nambu-Goto theory of open string
in light cone gauge, related in Lorentz-invariant way with the world sheet.
This allows to obtain a quantum theory without anomalies in Lorentz group. We
consider a special type of gauge fixing conditions, imposed in oscillator
sector of the theory, which lead to a relatively simple Hamiltonian mechanics,
convenient for canonical quantization. We discuss the algebraic and geometric
properties of this mechanics and determine its mass spectrum for the states of
spin singlet S=0.
