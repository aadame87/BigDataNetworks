Title: How far does the analogy between causal horizon-induced thermalization
  with the standard heat bath situation go?
Authors: Bert Schroer (CBPF, Rio de Janeiro)
Comments: 10 pages, based on talk given at the 2002 Londrina Winter School
\\
  After a short presentation of KMS states and modular theory as the unifying
description of thermalizing systems we propose the absence of transverse vacuum
fluctuations in the holographic projections as the mechanism for an area
behavior (the transverse area) of localization entropy as opposed to the volume
dependence of ordinary heat bath entropy. Thermalization through causal
localization is not a property of QM, but results from the omnipresent vacuum
polarization in QFT and does not require a Gibbs type ensemble avaraging
(coupling to a heat bath).
