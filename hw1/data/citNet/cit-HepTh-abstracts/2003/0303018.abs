Title: A Comment on the chi_y Genus and Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics

  In this note we show that a simple modification of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics involving a mass term for half the fermions naturally leads to a
derivation of the integral formula for the chi_y genus, a quantity that
interpolates between the Euler characteristic and arithmetic genus. We note
that this modification naturally arises in the moduli space dynamics of
monopoles or instantons in theories with 16 supercharges partially broken to 8
supercharges by mass terms.
