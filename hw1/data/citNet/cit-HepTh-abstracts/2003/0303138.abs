  We study the localized tachyon condensation of non-supersymmetric orbifold
backgrounds in their mirror Landau-Ginzburg picture. We first show that the
R-charges of chiral primaries increase under the process of condensing the
tachyon in the same chiral ring. Then, utilizing the existence of four copies
of (2,2) worldsheet supersymmetry, we show that the minimal tachyon mass in
twisted sectors increases in CFT and type 0 string and it plays the role of the
c-function of the twisted sectors. We also study the GSO projection in detail
and show that type II decays to only to type II while type 0 can mix with type
0 and II under the RG-flow.
