  We consider a geometric regularization for the class of conifold transitions
relating D-brane systems on noncompact Calabi-Yau spaces to certain flux
backgrounds. This regularization respects the SL(2,Z) invariance of the flux
superpotential, and allows for computation of the relevant periods through the
method of Picard-Fuchs equations. The regularized geometry is a noncompact
Calabi-Yau which can be viewed as a monodromic fibration, with the nontrivial
monodromy being induced by the regulator. It reduces to the original,
non-monodromic background when the regulator is removed. Using this
regularization, we discuss the simple case of the local conifold, and show how
the relevant field-theoretic information can be extracted in this approach.
