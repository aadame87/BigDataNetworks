  We study the realization of anomalous Ward identities in deconstructed
(latticized) supersymmetric theories. In a deconstructed four-dimensional
theory with N=2 supersymmetry, we show that the chiral symmetries only appear
in the infrared and that the anomaly is reproduced in the usual framework of
lattice perturbation theory with Wilson fermions. We then realize the theory on
the world-volume of fractional D-branes on an orbifold. In this brane
realization, we show how deconstructed theory anomalies can be computed via
classical supergravity. Our methods and observations are more generally
applicable to deconstructed/latticized supersymmetric theories in various
dimensions.
