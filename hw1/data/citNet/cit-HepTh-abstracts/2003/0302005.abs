  We study different Penrose limits of supergravity solution of NS5-brane in
the presence of RR field. Although in the case of NS5-brane we get a
4-dimensional plane wave, in the case with RR field we will get two different
plane waves; a 4-dimensional and a 3-dimensional one. These plane wave
solutions are the backgrounds that a particular string solution feels at one
loop approximation. Using the one loop correction one can identify a particular
subsector of LST/deformed LST which is dual to type II string theories on these
plane waves.
