Title: Cosmic Attractors and Gauge Hierarchy
Authors: Gia Dvali, Alexander Vilenkin
\\
  We suggest a new cosmological scenario which naturally guarantees the
smallness of scalar masses and VEVs, without invoking supersymmetry or any
other (non-gravitationaly coupled) new physics at low energies. In our
framework, the scalar masses undergo discrete jumps due to nucleation of closed
branes during (eternal) inflation. The crucial point is that the step size of
variation decreases in the direction of decreasing scalar mass. This scenario
yields exponentially large domains with a distribution of scalar masses, which
is sharply peaked around a hierarchically small value of the mass. This value
is the "attractor point" of the cosmological evolution.
