Title: Gauge covariant heat kernel expansion at finite temperature

  The heat kernel method is extended to the case of finite temperature. Special
emphasis is given to the study of gauge theories. Due to the compactness of
space in the Euclidean time direction (inverse temperature) the field strength
cannot completely characterize the gauge fields. This is just a manifestation
of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The field strength has to be supplemented by the
Polyakov loop. Only if the latter is taken into account one obtains gauge
covariant results for the generalized Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the heat
kernel expansion.
