Title: Gravitational Radiation from Travelling Waves on D-Strings
Authors: Julie D. Blum
Report-no: UTTG-01-03
\\
  Boundary states that preserve supersymmetry are constructed for fractional
D-strings with travelling waves on a ${\bf C}^3/ {{\bf Z}_2\times {\bf Z}_2}$
orbifold. The gravitational radiation emitted between two D-strings with
antiparallel travelling waves is calculated.
