  We obtain a general class of time-dependent, asymptotically de Sitter
backgrounds which solve the first order bosonic equations that extremize the
action for supergravity with gauged non-compact $R$-symmetry. These backgrounds
correspond only to neutral fields with the correct sign of kinetic energy.
Within N=2 five-dimensional supergravity with vector-superfields we provide
examples of multi-centered charged black holes in asymptotic de Sitter space,
whose spatial part is given by a time-dependent hyper-K\"ahler space. Reducing
these backgrounds to four dimensions yields asymptotically de Sitter
multi-centered charged black hole backgrounds and we show that they are related
to an instanton configuration by a massive T-duality over time. Within N=2
gauged supergravity in four (and five)-dimensions with hyper-multiplets there
could also be neutral cosmological backgrounds that are regular and correspond
to the different de Sitter spaces at early and late times.
