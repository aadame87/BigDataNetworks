  By using the systematic approach of parent action method, we derive the
Polyakov and two Weyl-invariant actions of bosonic p-branes ($p \geq 2$)
starting from the Nambu-Goto action, and establish the duality symmetries in
this set of four actions. Moreover, we discover a new bosonic p-brane action
(including the string theory) and deduce two corresponding Weyl-invariant
formulations by proposing a new special parent action. We find that the same
duality symmetries as those mentioned above exist in this new set of actions.
The new p-brane actions are also briefly analyzed.
