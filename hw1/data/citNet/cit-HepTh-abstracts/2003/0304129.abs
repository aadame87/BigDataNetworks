  We find a nonsupersymmetric dilatonic deformation of $AdS_5$ geometry as an
exact nonsingular solution of the type IIB supergravity. The dual gauge theory
has a different Yang-Mills coupling in each of the two halves of the boundary
spacetime divided by a codimension one defect. We discuss the geometry of our
solution in detail, emphasizing the structure of the boundary, and also study
the string configurations corresponding to Wilson loops. We also show that that
the background is stable under small scalar perturbations.
