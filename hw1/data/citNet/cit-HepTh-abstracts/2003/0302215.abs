Title: Electric/magnetic flux tube on the background of magnetic/electric field
Authors: V. Dzhunushaliev

  It is argued that the phenomenon of a flux tube in quantum chromodynamics is
closely connected with a spontaneously symmetry breakdown of gauge theory. It
is shown that in the presence of a mass term in the SU(2) gauge theory the
Nielsen-Olesen equations describe the flux tube surrounded by an external
field.
