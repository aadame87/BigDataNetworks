  The twisting function describing nonstandard (super-Jordanian) quantum
deformation of osp(1|2) is given in explicite closed form. The quantum
coproducts and universal R-matrix are presented. The non-uniqueness of twisting
function as well as two real forms of deformed osp(1|2) superalgebras are
considered. One real quantum osp(1|2) superalgebra is interpreted as describing
the $\kappa$-deformation of D=1, N=1 superconformal algebra, which can be
applied as symmetry algebra of N=1 superconformal mechanics.
