  We investigate dynamics of the homogeneous time-dependent SU(2) Yang-Mills
fields governed by the non-Abelian Born-Infeld lagrangian which arises in
superstring theory as a result of summation of all orders in the string slope
parameter $\alpha'$. It is shown that generically the Born-Infeld dynamics is
less chaotic than that in the ordinary Yang-Mills theory, and at high enough
field strength the Yang-Mills chaos is stabilized. More generally, a smothering
effect of the string non-locality on behavior of classical fields is
conjectured.
