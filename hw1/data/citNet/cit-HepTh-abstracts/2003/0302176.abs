  We consider a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian analysis for Yang-Mills theories in
three spatial dimensions. The gauge potentials are parametrized in terms of a
matrix variable which facilitates the elimination of the gauge degrees of
freedom. We develop an approximate calculation of the volume element on the
gauge-invariant configuration space, pointing out features related to
dimensional transmutation.
