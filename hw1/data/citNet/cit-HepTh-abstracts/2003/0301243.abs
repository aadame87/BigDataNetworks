Title: On geometric equations and duality for free higher spins
Authors: Xavier Bekaert and Nicolas Boulanger

  We provide a general scheme for dualizing higher-spin gauge fields in
arbitrary irreducible representations of GL(D,R). We also give a recipe for
constructing Fronsdal-like field equations and Lagrangians for such exotic
fields.
