  We study light-cone gauge quantization of IIB strings in AdS_5 \times S^5 for
small radius in Poincare coordinates. A picture of strings made up of
noninteracting bits emerges in the zero radius limit. In this limit, each bit
behaves like a superparticle moving in the AdS_5 \times S^5 background,
carrying appropriate representations of the super conformal group PSU(2,2|4).
The standard Hamiltonian operator which causes evolution in the light-cone time
has continuous eigenvalues and provides a basis of states which is not suitable
for comparing with the dual super Yang-Mills theory. However, there exist
operators in the light-cone gauge which have discrete spectra and can be used
to label the states. We construct states of the free string in this basis. We
include all possible states arising from discretizing the string into varying
number of bits. A non-zero value of the radius introduces interactions between
the bits and the spectrum of strings gets modified. We discuss the leading
perturbative corrections at small radius for a few simple cases. Potential
divergences in the perturbative corrections, arising from strings near the
boundary, cancel. We suggest that the divergences cancel in the computation of
anomalous dimensions of all physical string states because of the large amount
of supersymmetry present in the AdS_5 \times S^5 background. Our work provides
a framework for a rigorous and detailed testing of the AdS/CFT conjecture.
