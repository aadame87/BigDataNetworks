\\
  The radiation from oscillating kink in (1+1) dimensional relativistic
$\phi^4$ model is considered. Both analytical and numerical approaches are
presented and the comparison between these methods is discussed. Acceleration
of the kink in external radiation is calculated and numerical results are also
presented.
