Title: On Higher Dimensional Fuzzy Spherical Branes
Authors: Yusuke Kimura (RIKEN)
Comments: 20 pages
\\
  Matrix descriptions of higher dimensional spherical branes are investigated.
It is known that a fuzzy 2k-sphere is described by the coset space
SO(2k+1)/U(k) and has some extra dimensions. It is shown that a fuzzy 2k-sphere
is comprised of n^{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} spherical D(2k-1)-branes and has a fuzzy
2(k-1)-sphere at each point. We can understand the relationship between these
two viewpoints by the dielectric effect. Contraction of the algebra is also
discussed.
