Title: Sidestepping the Cosmological Constant with Football-Shaped Extra
  Dimensions

  We present an exact solution for a factorizable brane-world spacetime with
two extra dimensions and explicit brane sources. The compactification manifold
has the topology of a two-sphere, and is stabilized by a bulk cosmological
constant and magnetic flux. The geometry of the sphere is locally round except
for conical singularities at the locations of two antipodal branes, deforming
the sphere into an American-style football. The bulk magnetic flux needs to be
fine-tuned to obtain flat geometry on the branes. Once this is done, the brane
geometry is insensitive to the brane vacuum energy, which only affects the
conical deficit angle of the extra dimensions. Solutions of this form provide a
new arena in which to explore brane-world phenomenology and the effects of
extra dimensions on the cosmological constant problem.
