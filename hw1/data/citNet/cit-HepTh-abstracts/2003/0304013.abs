  We review the most general, local, superconformal boundary conditions for the
two-dimensional N=1 and N=2 non-linear sigma models, and analyse them for the
N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric WZW models. We find that the gluing map between the
left and right affine currents is generalised in a very specific way as
compared to the constant Lie algebra automorphisms that are known.
