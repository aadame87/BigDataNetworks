  We describe the supergravity solutions dual to D6-branes with both
time-dependent and time-independent B-fields. These backgrounds generalize the
Taub-NUT metric in two key ways: they have asymmetric warp factors and
background fluxes. In the time-dependent case, the warping takes a novel form.
Kaluza-Klein reduction in these backgrounds is unusual, and we explore some of
the new features. In particular, we describe how a localized gauge-field
emerges with an analogue of the open string metric and coupling. We also
describe a gravitational analogue of the Seiberg-Witten map. This provides a
framework in supergravity both for studying non-commutative gauge theories, and
for constructing novel warped backgrounds.
