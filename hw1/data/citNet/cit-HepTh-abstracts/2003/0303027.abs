  The notion of Galois currents in Rational Conformal Field Theory is
introduced and illustrated on simple examples. This leads to a natural
partition of all theories into two classes, depending on the existence of a
non-trivial Galois current. As an application, the projective kernel of a RCFT,
i.e. the set of all modular transformations represented by scalar multiples of
the identity, is described in terms of a small set of easily computable
invariants.
