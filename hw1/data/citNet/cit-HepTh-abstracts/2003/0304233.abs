  We compute the billiards that emerge in the Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz
(BKL) limit for all pure supergravities in D=4 spacetime dimensions, as well as
for D=4, N=4 supergravities coupled to k (N=4) Maxwell supermultiplets. We find
that just as for the cases N=0 and N=8 investigated previously, these billiards
can be identified with the fundamental Weyl chambers of hyperbolic Kac-Moody
algebras. Hence, the dynamics is chaotic in the BKL limit. A new feature
arises, however, which is that the relevant Kac-Moody algebra can be the
Lorentzian extension of a twisted affine Kac-Moody algebra, while the N=0 and
N=8 cases are untwisted. This occurs for N=5, N=3 and N=2. An understanding of
this property is provided by showing that the data relevant for determining the
billiards are the restricted root system and the maximal split subalgebra of
the finite-dimensional real symmetry algebra characterizing the toroidal
reduction to D=3 spacetime dimensions. To summarize: split symmetry controls
chaos.
