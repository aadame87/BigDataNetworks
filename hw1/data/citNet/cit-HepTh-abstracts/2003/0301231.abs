  Following the RG flow of an N=1 quiver gauge theory and applying Seiberg
duality whenever necessary defines a duality cascade, that in simple cases has
been understood holographically. The quiver living on branes at a generic
threefold singularity has Lorentzian signature and the Seiberg dualities hit a
duality wall at a certain energy scale, signaled by an exponential rise in the
number of degrees of freedom. We here study in detail the cascades and walls on
branes at the C_3/Z_3 orbifold. We determine, as a function of the initial
conditions of the (inverse) cascade, the energy scale of the wall as well as
the critical exponent governing the approach to the wall. The position of the
wall is piecewise linear, while the exponent appears to be constant. We comment
on the possible physical interpretation of these results.
