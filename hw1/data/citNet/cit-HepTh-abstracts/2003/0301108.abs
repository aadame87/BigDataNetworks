  The continuous and discrete symmetries of the Dirac-type operators produced
by particular Killing-Yano tensors are studied in manifolds of arbitrary
dimensions. The Killing-Yano tensors considered are covariantly constant and
realize certain square roots of the metric tensor. Such a Killing-Yano tensor
produces simultaneously a Dirac-type operator and the generator of a
one-parameter Lie group connecting this operator with the standard Dirac one.
The Dirac operators are related among themselves through continuous or discrete
transformations. The groups U(1) and SU(2) of continuous transformations are
typical for (hyper-)Kahler spaces, but in general the requirements for these
special geometries are not fulfilled. The discrete symmetries are also studied
obtaining the discrete groups Z_4 and Q. The briefly presented examples are the
Euclidean Taub-NUT space and the Minkowski spacetime.
