  We study the rotating tubular D2-brane as a time dependent supersymmetric
solution of type-IIA string theory. We show that the Poynting angular momentum
of the supertube can be replaced by the mechanical angular momentum without
disturbing the 8 supersymmetries. Unlike the non-rotating supertube, whose
cross section can take an arbitrary shape, the rotating supertube admits only
the circular cross section. When there is no electric field on the world
volume, the supersymmetry dictates the angular velocity of the tubular D2-brane
to be inversely proportional to the magnetic field. This rotating supertube can
be considered as the `blown-up' configuration of an array of spinning
D0-particles and is T-dual to the spiraling D-helix whose pitch moves at the
speed of light.
