  The Skyrme model is considered using the explicit parametrization of the
rotation group SO(3) by elements of its algebra. Topologically nontrivial
solutions arise even in the one-dimensional case because the fundamental group
of the group SO(3) is equal to Z_2. Static one-dimensional solutions are found
explicitly and analyzed. There are topologically nontrivial solutions with
finite energy among them. New class of projective models is proposed with a
target space which is an arbitrary real projective space RP^d.
