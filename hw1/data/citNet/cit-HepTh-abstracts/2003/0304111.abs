  It is shown that it is possible to define quantum field theory of a massless
scalar free field on the event horizon of a 2D-Rindler spacetime. Quantum free
field theory on the horizon enjoys diffeomorphism invariance and turns out to
be unitarily and algebraically equivalent to the analogous theory of a scalar
field propagating inside Rindler spacetime, nomatter the value of the mass of
the field in the bulk. More precisely, there exists a unitary transformation
that realizes the bulk-boundary correspondence upon an appropriate choice for
Fock representation spaces. Secondly, the found correspondence is a subcase of
an analogous algebraic correspondence described by injective *-homomorphisms of
the abstract algebras of observables generated by abstract quantum free-field
operators. These field operators are smeared with suitable test functions in
the bulk and exact 1-forms on the horizon. In this sense the correspondence is
independent from the chosen vacua. It is proven that, under that correspondence
the ``hidden'' SL(2,R) quantum symmetry found in a previous work gets a clear
geometric meaning, it being associated with a group of diffeomorphisms of the
horizon itself. Finally it is found that there is a possible enlargement of the
quantum symmetry on the horizon to a quantum Virasoro symmetry associated with
vector fields on the event horizon.
