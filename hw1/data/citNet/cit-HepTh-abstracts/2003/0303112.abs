Title: Wakes in Dilatonic Current-Carrying Cosmic Strings

\\
  In this work, we present the gravitational field generated by a cosmic string
carrying a timelike current in the scalar-tensor gravities. The mechanism of
formation and evolution of wakes is fully investigated in this framework. We
show explicitly that the inclusion of electromagnetic properties for the string
induces logarithmic divergences in the accretion problem.
