Title: Duality and interacting families in models with the inverse-squared
  interaction
Authors: Ivan Andric and Danijel Jurman

  Weak-strong coupling duality relations are shown to be present in the
quantum-mechanical many-body system with the interacting potential proportional
to the pair-wise inverse-squared distance in addition to the harmonic
potential. Using duality relations we have solved the problem of families
interacting by the inverse-squared interaction. Owing to duality, the coupling
constants of the families are mutually inverse. The spectrum and eigenfunctions
are determined mainly algebraically owing to O(2,1) dynamical symmetry. The
constructed Hamiltonian for families and appropriate solutions are of
hierarchical nature.
