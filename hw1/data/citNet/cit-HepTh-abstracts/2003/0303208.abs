  We address dynamical supersymmetry breaking within a N=1 supersymmetric
Standard-like Model based on a Z_2 x Z_2 Type IIA orientifold with intersecting
D6-branes. The model possesses an additional, confining gauge sector with the
USp(2)_A x USp(2)_B x USp(4) gauge group, where the gaugino condensation
mechanism allows for the breaking of supersymmetry and stabilizes moduli. We
derive the leading contribution to the non-perturbative effective
superpotential and determine numerically the minima of the supergravity
potential. These minima break supersymmetry and fix two undetermined moduli,
which in turn completely specify the gauge couplings at the string scale. For
this specific construction the minima have a negative cosmological constant. We
expect that for other supersymmetric Standard-like models with intersecting
D6-branes, which also possess confining gauge sectors, the supersymmetry
breaking mechanism would have qualitatively similar features.
