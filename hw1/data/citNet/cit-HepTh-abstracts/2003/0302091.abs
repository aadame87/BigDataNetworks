  Holes in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Marek Rogatko
Comments: 9 pages, RevTex, to be published in Phys.Rev.D15
\\
  We prove the uniqueness theorem for static higher dimensional charged black
holes spacetime containing an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface with
compact interior and with both degenerate and non-degenerate components of the
event horizon.
