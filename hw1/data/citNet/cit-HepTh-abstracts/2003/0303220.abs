  We study the quantum mechanics of BMN operators with two scalar impurities
and arbitrarily many traces, at one loop and all genus. We prove an operator
identity which partially elucidates the structure of this quantum mechanics,
provides some support for a conjectured formula for the free all genus
two-point functions, and demonstrates that a single O(g_2^2) contact term
arises in the Hamiltonian as a result of transforming from the natural gauge
theory basis to the string basis. We propose to identify the S-matrix of this
quantum mechanics with the S-matrix of string theory in the plane-wave
background.
