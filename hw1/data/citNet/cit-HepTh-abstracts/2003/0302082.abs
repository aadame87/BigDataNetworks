  A detailed investigation is presented of the energy-momentum tensor approach
to the evaluation of the force acting on a rigid Casimir cavity in a weak
gravitational field. Such a force turns out to have opposite direction with
respect to the gravitational acceleration. The order of magnitude for a
multi-layer cavity configuration is derived and experimental feasibility is
discussed, taking into account current technological resources.
