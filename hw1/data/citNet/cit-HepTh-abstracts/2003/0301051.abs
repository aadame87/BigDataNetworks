  An algorithm is devised to generate characteristic identities between Maxwell
fieldstrength invariants (traced over Lorentz indices and disregarding
ordering) that suffer linear dependence in certain dimensionalities as they
have been originally obtained using a Maple routine. These relations between
invariants are then applied to simplify the Abelian Born-Infeld (ABI) effective
action in arbitrary degree of fieldstrength invariants. I have explicitly
displayed the simplified ABI action in 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 space-time
dimensions relevant in Dp-branes.
