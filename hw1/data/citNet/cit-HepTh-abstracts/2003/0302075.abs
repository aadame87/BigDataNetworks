Title: Extended chiral algebras and the emergence of SU(2) quantum numbers in
  the Coulomb gas

  We study a set of chiral symmetries contained in degenerate operators beyond
the `minimal' sector of the c(p,q) models. For the operators
h_{(2j+2)q-1,1}=h_{1,(2j+2)p-1} at conformal weight [ (j+1)p-1 ][ (j+1)q -1 ],
for every 2j \in N, we find 2j+1 chiral operators which have quantum numbers of
a spin j representation of SU(2). We give a free-field construction of these
operators which makes this structure explicit and allows their OPEs to be
calculated directly without any use of screening charges. The first non-trivial
chiral field in this series, at j=1/2, is a fermionic or para-fermionic
doublet. The three chiral bosonic fields, at j=1, generate a closed W-algebra
and we calculate the vacuum character of these triplet models.
