  Noncommutative Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in 3-dimensions is defined in
terms of star product and noncommutative fields. Seiberg-Witten map is employed
to write it in terms of ordinary fields. A parent action is introduced and the
dual action is derived. For spatial noncommutativity it is studied up to second
order in the noncommutativity parameter \theta. A new noncommutative
Chern-Simons action is defined in terms of ordinary fields, inspired by the
dual action. Moreover, a transformation between noncommuting and ordinary
fields is proposed.
