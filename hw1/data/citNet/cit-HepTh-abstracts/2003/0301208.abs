Title: Conformal Invariance and Quantum Nature of Particles
Authors: Hadi Salehi, Yousef Bisabr

  We investigate a gravitational model whose vacuum sector is invariant under
conformal transformations. In this model, matter is taken to be coupled with a
metric which is different but conformally related to the metric appearing
explicitly in the vacuum sector. It is then show that the effect of a conformal
symmetry breaking would lead to a particle concept. In particular, a
correspondence between quantum nature of the particles and the gravitational
interaction of matter is established.
