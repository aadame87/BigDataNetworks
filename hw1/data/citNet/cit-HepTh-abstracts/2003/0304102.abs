  It is argued that free QFT can be defined on the event horizon of a
Schwarzschild-like spacetime and that this theory is unitarily and
algebraically equivalent to QFT in the bulk (near the horizon). Under that
unitary equivalence the bulk hidden SL(2,R) symmetry found in a previous work
becomes manifest on the event horizon, it being induced by a group of horizon
diffeomorphisms. The class of generators of that group can be enlarged to
include a full Virasoro algebra of fields which are defined on the event
horizon. These generators have a quantum representation in QFT on the event
horizon and thus in the bulk.
