Title: A note and a new perspective on particle horizon problem
Authors: Zhang Hongsheng
Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures
\\
  We cautiously reanalyze some easyly confused notions on particle horizon
problem in this paper and then we give a new answer to the particle horizon
problem. This answer is independent of physics plunging into Planck time.
