  We discuss the propagation of scalars in a large class of non-extremal black
hole and black p-brane geometries in generic dimensions. We show that the
radial wave equation near the horizon possesses the SL(2,R) structure in every
case; approximately it takes the form of the wave equation in the SL(2,R)
(AdS_3) background and has a symmetry related to the T-duality of the string
model in that geometry. We see a close connection to two and three dimensional
black holes. We also find that, in some parameter region, the absorption
cross-sections by the black objects take the form expected from a conformal
field theory. Our results indicate that some of the properties known about a
certain class of four and five dimensional black holes hold more generally.
