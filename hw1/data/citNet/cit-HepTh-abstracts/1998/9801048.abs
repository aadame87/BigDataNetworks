  The entropy of a seven dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of arbitrary
large radius is obtained by a mapping onto a near extremal self-dual
three-brane whose partition function can be evaluated. The three-brane arises
from duality after submitting a neutral blackbrane, from which the
Schwarzschild black hole can be obtained by compactification, to an infinite
boost in non compact eleven dimensional space-time and then to a Kaluza-Klein
compactification. This limit can be defined in precise terms and yields the
Bekenstein-Hawking value up to a factor of order one which can be set to be
exactly one with the extra assumption of keeping only transverse brane
excitations. The method can be generalized to five and four dimensional black
holes.
