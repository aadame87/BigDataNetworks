  The local logarithmic conformal field theory corresponding to the triplet
algebra at c=-2 is constructed. The constraints of locality and crossing
symmetry are explored in detail, and a consistent set of amplitudes is found.
The spectrum of the corresponding theory is determined, and it is found to be
modular invariant. This provides the first construction of a non-chiral
rational logarithmic conformal field theory, establishing that such models can
indeed define bona fide conformal field theories.
