  Lorentz covariant generalisations of the notions of supersymmetry, superspace
and self-duality are discussed. The essential idea is to extend standard
constructions by allowing tangent vectors and coordinates which transform
according to more general Lorentz representations than solely the spinorial and
vectorial ones of standard lore. Such superspaces provide model configuration
spaces for theories of arbitrary spin fields. Our framework is an elegant one
for handling higher-dimensional theories in a manifestly SO(3,1) covariant
fashion. A further application is the construction of a hierarchy of solvable
Lorentz covariant systems generalising four-dimensional self-duality.
