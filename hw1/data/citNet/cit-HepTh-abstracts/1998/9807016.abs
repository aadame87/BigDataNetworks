  We analyze the BRST field-antifield construction for generalized gauge fields
consisting of massless mixed representations of the Lorentz Group and we
calculate all the strictly gauge invariant interactions between them. All these
interactions are higher derivative terms constructed out from the derivatives
of the curl of field strength.
