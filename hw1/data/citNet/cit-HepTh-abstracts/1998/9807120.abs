  We consider evidence for the existence of gauge configurations with
fractional charge in pure N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory . We argue that
these field configurations are singular and have to be treated as
distributions. It is shown that the path integral representation of constant
Green's functions can be reduced to a finite dimensional integral. The
fractional configurations are essentially the zero size limit of the usual
instantons and they have a reduced number of fermionic zero modes. At the end
we comment on the status of the D-instanton/YM-instanton correspondence within
AdS/CFT correspondence.
