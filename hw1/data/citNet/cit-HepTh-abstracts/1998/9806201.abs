Title: Feynman Graphs from D-Particle Dynamics
Authors: Amir H. Fatollahi
Comments: It is added that graphs and their associated amplitudes can be
  corresponded to a field theory only in the light-cone frame. Also the
  application to define M-theory by an energetic expansion is discussed. LaTeX

  It is argued that quantum propagation of D-particles in the limit \alpha'-> 0
can represent the "joining-splitting" processes of Feynman graphs of a certain
field theory in the light-cone frame. So basically it provides the possibility
to define a field theory by its Feynman graphs. The application of this
observation to define M-theory by an energetic expansion approach is discussed.
