  We study the large N limit of the interacting superconformal field theories
associated with N M5 branes or M2 branes using the recently proposed relation
between these theories and M theory on AdS spaces. We first analyze the
spectrum of chiral operators of the 6d (0,2) theory associated with M5 branes
in flat space, and find full agreement with earlier results obtained using its
DLCQ description as quantum mechanics on a moduli space of instantons. We then
perform a similar analysis for the D_N type 6d (0,2) theories associated with
M5 branes at an R^5/Z_2 singularity, and for the 3d N=8 superconformal field
theories associated with M2 branes in flat space and at an R^8/Z_2 singularity
respectively. Little is known about these three theories, and our study yields
for the first time their spectrum of chiral operators (in the large N limit).
