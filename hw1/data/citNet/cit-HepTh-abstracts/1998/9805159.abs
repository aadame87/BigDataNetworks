  ``Nonperturbative Methods in Quantum Field Theory'' (February 1998,

  The phenomenon of the magnetic catalysis of dynamical symmetry breaking is
based on the dimensional reduction $D\to D-2$ in the dynamics of fermion
pairing in a magnetic field. We discuss similarities between this phenomenon
and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This leads to the interpretation of the dynamics
of the (1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu model with a non-integer number of fermion
colors as a quantum field theoretical analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm dynamics.
