  We derive the microscopic spectral density of the Dirac operator in
$SU(N_c\geq 3)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled to $N_f$ fermions in the fundamental
representation. An essential technical ingredient is an exact rewriting of this
density in terms of integrations over the super Riemannian manifold
$Gl(N_f+1|1)$. The result agrees exactly with earlier calculations based on
Random Matrix Theory.
