  In this paper the kernel for the spectral correlation functions of the
invariant chiral random matrix ensembles with real ($\beta =1$) and quaternion
real ($\beta = 4$) matrix elements is expressed in terms of the kernel of the
corresponding complex Hermitean random matrix ensembles ($\beta=2$). Such
identities are exact in case of a Gaussian probability distribution and, under
certain smoothness assumptions, they are shown to be valid asymptotically for
an arbitrary finite polynomial potential. They are proved by means of a
construction proposed by Br\'ezin and Neuberger. Universal behavior at the hard
edge of the spectrum for all three chiral ensembles then follows from
microscopic universality for $\beta =2$ as shown by Akemann, Damgaard, Magnea
and Nishigaki.
