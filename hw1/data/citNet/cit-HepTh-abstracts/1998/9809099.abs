  We compute the quadratic part of the thermal effective action for real scalar
fields which are initially in thermal equilibrium and vary slowly in time using
a generalised real-time formalism proposed by Le Bellac and Mabilat
\cite{belmab}. We derive both Real Time and Imaginary Time Formalisms and find
that the result is analytic at the limits of zero external four-momenta when
using our full time contour. We expand the fields in time up to the second
derivative and discuss the initial time dependence of our result before and
after the expansion in terms of equilibrium.
