  We show how to reduce the non abelian Born-Infeld action describing the
interaction of two D-particles to the sum of elliptic integrals depending on
simple kinematic invariants. This representation gives explicitly all alpha'
corrections to D-particle dynamics. The alpha' corrections induce a
stabilization of the classical trajectories such as the ``eikonal'' which are
unstable within the Yang-Mills approximation.
