Title: Spacetime at the Planck scale and Path Integral
Author: Gianpiero Mangano
Comments: RevTex, 3 pages, no figures, to appear in Proceedings of 6th
  International Conference on Path Integral, Florence, August 1998
Report-no: DSF 38/98
\\
  We discuss a path integral formalism to introduce noncommutative
generalizations of spacetime manifold in even dimensions, which have been
suggested to be reasonable effective pictures at very small length scales, of
the order of Planck length.
