  This note is supposed to be an introduction to those concepts of toric
geometry that are necessary to understand applications in the context of string
and F-theory dualities. The presentation is based on the definition of a toric
variety in terms of homogeneous coordinates, stressing the analogy with
weighted projective spaces. We try to give both intuitive pictures and precise
rules that should enable the reader to work with the concepts presented here.
