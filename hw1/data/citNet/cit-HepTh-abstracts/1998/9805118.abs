  The master differential equations in the external square momentum p^2 for the
master integrals of the two-loop sunrise graph, in n-continuous dimensions and
for arbitrary values of the internal masses, are derived. The equations are
then used for working out the values at p^2 = 0 and the expansions in p^2 at
p^2 =0, in (n-4) at n to 4 limit and in 1/p^2 for large values of p^2 .
