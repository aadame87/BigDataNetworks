These notes review the effective lagrangian treatment of Goldstone and
pseudo-Goldstone bosons, taking examples from high-energy/nuclear and
condensed-matter physics. The contents are:
  1. Goldstone Bosons
  2. Pions: A Relativistic Application
  3. Magnons: Nonrelativistic Applications
  4. SO(5) Invariance and Superconductors
  5. Bibliography
