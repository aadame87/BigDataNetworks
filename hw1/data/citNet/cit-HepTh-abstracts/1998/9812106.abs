  In a recent paper it was shown that the response of an integrable QFT under
variation of the Unruh temperature can be computed from a S-matrix preserving
deformation of the form factor approach. We give explicit expressions for the
deformed two-particle formfactors for various integrable models: The
Sine-Gordon and SU(2) Thirring model, several perturbed minimal CFTs and the
real coupling affine Toda series. A uniform pattern is found to emerge when
both the S-matrix and the deformed form factors are expressed in terms Barnes'
multi-periodic functions.
