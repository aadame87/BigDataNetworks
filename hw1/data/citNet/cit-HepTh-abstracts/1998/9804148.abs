  We consider the canonical quantization of a generalized two-dimensional
massive fermion theory containing higher odd-order derivatives. The
requirements of Lorentz invariance, hermiticity of the Hamiltonian and absence
of tachyon excitations suffice to fix the mass term, which contains a
derivative coupling. We show that the basic quantum excitations of a
higher-derivative theory of order 2N+1 consist of a physical usual massive
fermion, quantized with positive metric, plus 2N unphysical massless fermions,
quantized with opposite metrics. The positive metric Hilbert subspace, which is
isomorphic to the space of states of a massive free fermion theory, is selected
by a subsidiary-like condition. Employing the standard bosonization scheme, the
equivalent boson theory is derived. The results obtained are used as a
guideline to discuss the solution of a theory including a current-current
interaction.
