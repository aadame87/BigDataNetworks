  We present a complete derivation of absorption cross-section and Hawking
radiation of minimal and fixed scalars from the Strominger-Vafa model of
five-dimensional black hole, starting right from the moduli space of the D1-D5
brane system. We determine the precise coupling of this moduli space to bulk
modes by using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our methods resolve a long-standing
problem regarding emission of fixed scalars. We calculate three-point
correlators of operators coupling to the minimal scalars from supergravity and
from SCFT, and show that both vanish. We make some observations about how the
AdS/SYM correspondence implies a close relation between large $N$ equations of
motion of $d$-dimensional gauge theory and supergravity equations on
$AdS_{d+1}$-type backgrounds. We compare with the explicit nonlocal transform
relating 1 and 2 dimensions in the context of $c=1$ matrix model.
