  We determine the spectrum of currents generated by the operator product
expansion of the energy-momentum tensor in N=4 super-symmetric Yang-Mills
theory. Up to the regular terms and in addition to the multiplet of the stress
tensor, three current multiplets appear, Sigma, Xi and Upsilon, starting with
spin 0, 2 and 4, respectively. The OPE's of these new currents generate an
infinite tower of current multiplets, one for each even spin, which exhibit a
universal structure, of length 4 in spin units, identified by a two-parameter
rational family. Using higher spin techniques developed recently for conformal
field theories, we compute the critical exponents of Sigma, Xi and Upsilon in
the TT OPE and prove that the essential structure of the algebra holds at
arbitrary coupling. We argue that the algebra closes in the strongly coupled
large-$N_c$ limit. Our results determine the quantum conformal algebra of the
theory and answer several questions that previously remained open.
