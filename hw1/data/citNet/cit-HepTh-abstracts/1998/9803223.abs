Title: Renormalization Ambiguities in Casimir Energy
Author: Luiz C. de Albuquerque (University of Sao Paulo)
Comments: 16 pages, Latex
\\
  Some questions were recently raised about the equivalence of two methods
commonly used to compute the Casimir energy: the mode summation approach and
the one-loop effective potential. In this respect, we argue that the scale
dependence induced by renormalization effects, displayed by the effective
potential approach, also appears in the MS method.
