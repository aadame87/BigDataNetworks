  Strong-weak duality invariance can only be defined for particular sectors of
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. Nevertheless, for full non-Abelian
non-supersymmetric theories, dual theories with inverted couplings, have been
found. We show that an analogous procedure allows to find the dual action to
the gauge theory of gravity constructed by the MacDowell-Mansouri model plus
the superposition of a $\Theta$ term.
