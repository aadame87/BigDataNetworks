  In the possible scaling region for lattice chiral fermions advocated in 
hep-lat/9609037, no hard spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs and
doublers are gauge-invariantly decoupled via mixing with composite
three-fermion-states. However the strong coupling expansion breaks down due to
no ``static limit'' for the low-energy limit ($p\sim 0$). We further analyze
relevant Green functions of three-fermion-operators. It is shown that in the
low-energy limit, the propagators of three-fermion-states with the ``wrong''
chiralities positively vanish due to the generalized form factors (the
wave-function renormalizations) of these composite states vanishing as
$O(p^4)$. This strongly implies that three-fermion-states with ``wrong''
chirality are ``decoupled'' in this limit.
