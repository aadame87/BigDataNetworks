  An example is given of a plane topological defect solution of linearized
Einstein-Cartan (EC) field equation representing a cosmic wall boundary of
spinning matter. The source of Cartan torsion is composed of two orthogonal
lines of static polarized spins bounded by the cosmic plane wall. The
Kopczy\'{n}ski- Obukhov - Tresguerres (KOT) spin fluid stress-energy current
coincides with thin planar matter current in the static case. Our solution is
similar to Letelier solution of Einstein equation for multiple cosmic strings.
Due to this fact we suggest that the lines of spinning matter could be
analogous to multiple cosmic spinning string solution in EC theory of gravity.
When torsion is turned off a pure Riemannian cosmic wall is obtained.
