  Aspects of d=4, N=4 superconformal U(N) gauge theory are studied at finite
temperature. Utilizing dual description of large $N$ and strong coupling limit
via Type IIB string theory compactification on Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter
spacetime, we study correlations of Wilson-Polyakov loops and heavy quark
potential thereof. We find that the heavy quark potential is Coulomb-like and
has a finite range, as expected for gauge theory in high temperature,
deconfinement phase. The potential exhibits finite temperature scaling
consistent with underlying conformal invariance. We also study isolated heavy
quark on probe D3-brane world-volume and find supporting evidence that near
extremal D3-branes are located at Schwarzschild horizon.
