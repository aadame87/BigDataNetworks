  We report here the status of different gauge conditions in the canonical
formulation of quantum electrodynamics on light-front surfaces. We start with
the massive vector fields as pedagogical models where all basic concepts and
possible problems manifestly appear. Several gauge choices are considered for
both the infinite and the finite volume formulation of massless gauge field
electrodynamics. We obtain the perturbative Feynman rules in the first approach
and the quantum Hamiltonian for all sectors in the second approach. Different
space-time dimensions are discussed in all models where they crucially change
the physical meaning. Generally, fermions are considered as the charged matter
fields but also one simple 1+1 dimensional model is discussed for scalar
fields. Finally the perspectives for further research projects are discussed.
