  We carry out the extension of the Ostrogradski method to relativistic field
theories. Higher-derivative Lagrangians reduce to second differential-order
with one explicit independent field for each degree of freedom. We consider a
higher-derivative relativistic theory of a scalar field and validate a powerful
order-reducing covariant procedure by a rigorous phase-space analysis. The
physical and ghost fields appear explicitly. Our results strongly support the
formal covariant methods used in higher-derivative gravity.
