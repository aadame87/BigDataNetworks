  We point out that two distinct distance--energy relations have been discussed
in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In conformal backgrounds they differ only in
normalization, but in nonconformal backgrounds they differ in functional form.
We discuss the relation to probe processes, the holographic principle, and
black hole entropies.
