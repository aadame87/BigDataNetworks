  Type IIB string action on AdS_5 x S^5 constructed in hep-th/9805028 is put
into a form where it becomes quadratic in fermions. This is achieved by
performing 2-d duality (T-duality) on the action in which kappa-symmetry was
fixed in the Killing gauge in hep-th/9808038. We discuss some properties and
possible applications of the resulting action.
