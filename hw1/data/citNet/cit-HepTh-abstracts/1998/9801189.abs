  We calculate the spin dependent static force between two D0-branes in Matrix
theory. Supersymmetry relates velocity dependent potentials to spin dependent
potentials. The well known v^4/r^7 term is related to a theta^8/r^11 term,
where theta is the relative spin of the D0-branes. We calculate this term,
confirming that it is the lowest order contribution to the static potential,
and find its structure consistent with supergravity.
