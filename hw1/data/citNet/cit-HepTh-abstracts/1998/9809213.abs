  To construct actions for describing superbranes propagating in AdS x S
superbackgrounds we propose a coset space realization of these superbackgrounds
which results in a short polynomial fermionic dependence (up to the sixth power
in Grassmann coordinates) of target superspace supervielbeins and
superconnections. Gauge fixing kappa-symmetry in a way compatible with a static
brane solution further reduces the fermionic dependence down to the fourth
power. Subtleties of consistent gauge fixing worldvolume diffeomorphisms and
kappa-symmetry of the superbrane actions are discussed.
