  We study the spectrum of the domain walls interpolating between different
chirally asymmetric vacua in supersymmetric QCD with the SU(3) gauge group and
including 2 pairs of chiral matter multiplets in fundamental and
anti-fundamental representations. For small enough masses m < m* = .286... (in
the units of \Lambda), there are two different domain wall solutions which are
BPS-saturated and two types of ``wallsome sphalerons''. At m = m*, two BPS
branches join together and, in the interval m* < m < m** = 3.704..., BPS
equations have no solutions but there are solutions to the equations of motion
describing a non-BPS domain wall and a sphaleron. For m > m**, there are no
solutions whatsoever.
