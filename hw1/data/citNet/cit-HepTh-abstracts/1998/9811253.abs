  Abelian Lagrangians containing Phi^4-type vertices are regularized by means
of a suitable point-splitting scheme combined with generalized gauge
transformations.. The calculation is developed in details for a general
Lagrangean, whose fields (gauge and matter ones) satisfy usual conditions. We
illustrate our results by considering some special cases, such as the
($\overline{\psi}\psi)^2 and a modified version of the Avddev-Chizhov models.
Possible application of our results to the Abelian Higgs model, whenever
spontaneous symmetry breaking is considered, is also discussed. We also pay
attention to a number of features of the point-split action such as the
regularity and non-locality of its new ``interacting terms''.
