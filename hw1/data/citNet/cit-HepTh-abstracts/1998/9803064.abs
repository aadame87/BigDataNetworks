  The statistical entropy of a five-dimensional black hole in Type II string
theory was recently derived by showing that it is U-dual to the
three-dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole, and using Carlip's
method to count the microstates of the latter. This is valid even for the
non-extremal case, unlike the derivation which relies on D-brane techniques. In
this letter, I shall exploit the U-duality that exists between the
five-dimensional black hole and the two-dimensional charged black hole of
McGuigan, Nappi and Yost, to microscopically compute the entropy of the latter.
It is shown that this result agrees with previous calculations using
thermodynamic arguments.
