  We present a method for the calculation of the $a_{3/2}$ heat kernel
coefficient of the heat operator trace for a partial differential operator of
Laplace type on a compact Riemannian manifold with oblique boundary conditions.
Using special case evaluations, restrictions are put on the general form of the
coefficients, which, supplemented by conformal transformation techniques,
allows the entire smeared coefficient to be determined.
