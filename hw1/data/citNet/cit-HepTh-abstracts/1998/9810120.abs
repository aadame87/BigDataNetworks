  We show equivalence between the massive Thirring model and the sine-Gordon
theory by gauge fixing a wider gauge invariant theory in two different ways.
The exact derivation of the equivalence hinges on the existence of an
underlying conformal symmetry. Previous derivations were all perturbative in
mass (althought to all orders).
