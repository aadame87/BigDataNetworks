Title: Self-field QED(1+1) with massless matter fields: Two-body problem
Author: Fuad M. Saradzhev
Comments: enlarged and revised version, LATEX file, 17 pp
\\
  We consider two-body problem in the self-field (1+1)-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics on the circle. We present two formulations of the problem which
correspond to two different types of variational principles and prove that both
formulations lead to the same spectrum of the two-body Hamiltonian with
massless matter fields. We give the exact and complete solution of the
relativistic two-body equation in the massless case.
