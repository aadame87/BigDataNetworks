  Superconformal symmetry in six-dimensions is analyzed in terms of coordinate
transformations on superspace. A superconformal Killing equation is derived and
its solutions are identified in terms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentz
transformations, R-symmetry transformations and special superconformal
transformations. The full superconformal symmetry, which is shown to form the
group OSp(2,6|N), is possible only if the supersymmetry algebra has N spinorial
generators of the same chirality, corresponding to (N,0) supersymmetry. The
R-symmetry group is then Sp(N) and the corresponding superspace is R^{6|8N}. We
define superinversion as a map to the associated superspace of opposite
chirality. General formulae for two-point and three-point correlation functions
of quasi-primary superfields are exhibited. The superconformal group in
six-dimensions is reduced to a corresponding extended superconformal group in
four-dimensions. Superconformally covariant differential operators are also
discussed.
