Title: The Poisson structure of the mean-field equations in the Phi^4 theory
Authors: Cecile Martin

\\
  We show that the mean-field time dependent equations in the Phi^4 theory can
be put into a classical non-canonical hamiltonian framework with a Poisson
structure which is a generalization of the standard Poisson bracket. The
Heisenberg invariant appears as a structural invariant of the Poisson tensor.
