  The classical order parameters for the $\N=2$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge
theory with matter in the adjoint representation are exhibited explicitly as
conservation laws for the elliptic Calogero-Moser system. Central to the
construction are certain elliptic function identities, which arise from
considering Feynman diagrams in a theory of free fermions with twisted boundary
conditions.
