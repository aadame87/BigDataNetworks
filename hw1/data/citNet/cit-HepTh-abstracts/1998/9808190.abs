  The light-cone little group, SO(9), classifies the massless degrees of
freedom of eleven-dimensional supergravity, with a triplet of representations.
We observe that this triplet generalizes to four-fold infinite families with
the quantum numbers of massless higher spin states. Their mathematical
structure stems from the three equivalent ways of embedding SO(9) into the
exceptional group $F_4$.
