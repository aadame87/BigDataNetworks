  We study the graviton self-energy function in a general gauge, using a hard
thermal loop expansion which includes terms proportional to T^4, T^2 and
log(T). We verify explicitly the gauge independence of the leading T^4 term and
obtain a compact expression for the sub-leading T^2 contribution. It is shown
that the logarithmic term has the same structure as the ultraviolet pole part
of the T=0 self-energy function. We argue that the gauge-dependent part of the
T^2 contribution is effectively canceled in the dispersion relations of the
graviton plasma, and present the solutions of these equations.
