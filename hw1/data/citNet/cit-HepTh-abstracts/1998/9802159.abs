  The large distance behavior of the Maxwell- Chern-Simons (MCS) equations is
analyzed, and it is found that the pure Chern-Simons limit, (when the Maxwell
term is dropped from the equations), does not describe the large distance limit
of the MCS model. This necessitates the solution of the original problem. The
MCS gauge theory coupled to a nonrelativistic matter field, (governed by the
gauged non-linear Schr\"odinger equation), is studied. It turns out, that there
are no regular self-dual solutions as in the pure Chern-Simons case, but the
model admits interesting, though singular self-dual solutions. The properties
of these solutions, and their large distance limits are analyzed.
