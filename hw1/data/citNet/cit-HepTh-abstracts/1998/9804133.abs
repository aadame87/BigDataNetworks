  We perform the stochastic quantization of Yang-Mills theory in configuration
space and derive the Faddeev-Popov path integral density. Based on a
generalization of the stochastic gauge fixing scheme and its geometrical
interpretation this result is obtained as the exact equilibrium solution of the
associated Fokker--Planck equation. Included in our discussion is the precise
range of validity of our approach.
