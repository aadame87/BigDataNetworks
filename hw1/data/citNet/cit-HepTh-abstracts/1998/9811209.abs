  Superconformal Ward identities for N=1 supersymmetric quantum field theories
in four dimensions are convenienty obtained in the superfield formalism by
combining diffeomorphisms and Weyl transformations on curved superspace. Using
this approach we study the superconformal transformation properties of Green
functions with one or more insertions of the supercurrent to all orders in
perturbation theory. For the case of two insertions we pay particular attention
to fixing the additional counterterms present, as well as to the purely
geometrical anomalies which contribute to the transformation behaviour.
Moreover we show in a scheme-independent way how the quasi-local terms in the
Ward identities are related to similar terms which contribute to the
supercurrent two and three point functions.
  Furthermore we relate our superfield approach to similar studies which use
the component formalism by discussing the implications of our approach for the
components of the supercurrent and of the supergravity prepotentials.
