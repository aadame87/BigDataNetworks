  We consider conformal non-Abelian Toda theories obtained by hamiltonian
reduction from Wess-Zumino-Witten models based on general real Lie groups. We
study in detail the possible choices of reality conditions which can be imposed
on the WZW or Toda fields and prove correspondences with sl(2,R) embeddings
into real Lie algebras and with the possible real forms of the associated
W-algebras. We devise a a method for finding all real embeddings which can be
obtained from a given embedding of sl(2,C) into a complex Lie algebra. We then
apply this to give a complete classification of real embeddings which are
principal in some simple regular subalgebra of a classical Lie algebra.
