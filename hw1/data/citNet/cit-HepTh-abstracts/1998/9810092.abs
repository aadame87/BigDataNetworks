  We construct BPS-exact solutions of the worldvolume Born-Infeld plus WZW
action of a D5-brane in the background of N D3-branes. The non-trivial
background metric and RR five-form field strength play a crucial role in the
solution. When a D5-brane is dragged across a stack of N D3-branes a bundle of
N fundamental strings joining the two types of branes is created, as in the
Hanany-Witten effect. Our solutions give a detailed description of this bundle
in terms of a D5-brane wrapped on a sphere. We discuss extensions of these
solutions which have an interpretation in terms of gauge theory multi-quark
states via the AdS/CFT correspondence.
