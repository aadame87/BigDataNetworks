  New forms of Born-Infeld, D-brane and M theory five-brane actions are found
which are quadratic in the abelian field strength. The gauge fields couple both
to a background or induced metric and a new auxiliary metric, whose elimination
reproduces the non-polynomial Born-Infeld action. This is similar to the
introduction of an auxiliary metric to simplify the Nambu-Goto string action.
This simplifies the quantisation and dualisation of the gauge fields.
