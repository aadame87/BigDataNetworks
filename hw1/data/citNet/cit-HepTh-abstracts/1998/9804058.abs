  Conformal techniques are applied to the calculation of integrals on AdS(d+1)
space which define correlators of composite operators in the superconformal
field theory on the d-dimensional boundary. The 3-point amplitudes for scalar
fields of arbitrary mass and gauge fields in the AdS supergravity are
calculated explicitly. For 3 gauge fields we compare in detail with the known
conformal structure of the SU(4) flavor current correlator <J_i^a J_j^b J_k^c>
of the N=4, d=4 SU(N) SYM theory. Results agree with the free field
approximation as would be expected from superconformal non-renormalization
theorems. In studying the Ward identity relating <J_i^a O^I O^J> to <O^I O^J>
for (non-marginal) scalar composite operators O^I, we find that there is a
subtlety in obtaining the normalization of <O^I O^J> from the supergravity
action integral.
