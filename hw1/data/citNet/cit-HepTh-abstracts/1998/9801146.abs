  We study Seiberg duality for N=1 supersymmetric QCD with soft
supersymmetry-breaking terms. We generate the soft terms through gauge
mediation by coupling two theories related by Seiberg duality to the same
supersymmetry-breaking sector. In this way, we know what a
supersymmetry-breaking perturbation in one theory maps into in its ``dual''.
Assuming a canonical Kahler potential we calculate the soft terms induced in
the magnetic theory and find that some of the scalars acquire negative masses
squared. If duality is still good for small supersymmetry breaking, this may
imply some specific symmetry breaking patterns for supersymmetric QCD with
small soft supersymmetry-breaking masses, in the case that its dual theory is
weakly coupled in the infrared. In the limit of large supersymmetry breaking,
the electric theory becomes ordinary QCD. However, the resulting symmetry
breaking in the magnetic theory is incompatible with that expected for QCD.
