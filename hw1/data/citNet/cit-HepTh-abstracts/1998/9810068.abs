  We reexamine the issue of the soliton mass in two-dimensional models with N
=1 supersymmetry. The superalgebra has a central extension, and at the
classical level the soliton solution preserves 1/2 of supersymmetry which is
equivalent to BPS saturation. We prove that the property of BPS saturation,
i.e. the equality of the soliton mass to the central charge, remains intact at
the quantum level in all orders of the weak coupling expansion. Our key finding
is an anomaly in the expression for the central charge. The classical central
charge, equal to the jump of the superpotential, is amended by an anomalous
term proportional to the second derivative of the superpotential. The anomaly
is established by various methods in explicit one-loop calculations. We argue
that this one-loop result is not affected by higher orders. We discuss in
detail how the impact of the boundary conditions can be untangled from the
soliton mass calculation. In particular, the soliton profile and the energy
distribution are found at one loop. A "supersymmetry" in the soliton mass
calculations in the non-supersymmetric models is observed.
