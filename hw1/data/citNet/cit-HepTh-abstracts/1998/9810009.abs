  Invariance principles determine many key properties in quantum field theory,
including, in particular, the appropriate form of the boundary conditions. A
crucial consistency check is the proof that the resulting boundary-value
problem is strongly elliptic. In Euclidean quantum gravity, the appropriate
principle seems to be the invariance of boundary conditions under infinitesimal
diffeomorphisms on metric perturbations, and hence their BRST invariance.
However, if the operator on metric perturbations is then chosen to be of
Laplace type, the boundary-value problem for the quantized gravitational field
fails to be strongly elliptic. A detailed proof is presented, and the
corresponding open problems are discussed.
