  In the no-boundary univers e the universe is created from an instanton.
However, there does not exist any instanton for the ``realistic'' $FRW$
universe with a scalar field. The ``instanton'' leading to its quantum creation
may be modified and reinterpreted as a constrained gravitational instanton.
