Title: Towards a background independent approach to M theory
Authors: Lee Smolin
Comments: 21 pages, LATEX, no figures. Contribution to a special issue of
  Chaos, Solitons and Fractals on " Superstrings, M,F,S....Theory"
\\
  Work in progress is described which aims to construct a background
independent formulation of M theory by extending results about background
independent states and observables from quantum general relativity and
supergravity to string theory. A list of principles for such a theory is
proposed which is drawn from results of both string theory and background
independent approaches to quantum gravity. Progress is reported on a background
independent membrane field theory and on a realization of the holographic
principle based on finite surfaces.
