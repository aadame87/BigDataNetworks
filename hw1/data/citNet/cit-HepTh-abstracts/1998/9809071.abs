\\
  Gauge invariant conservation laws for the linear and angular momenta are
studied in a certain 2+1 dimensional first order dynamical model of vortices in
superconductivity. In analogy with fluid vortices it is possible to express the
linear and angular momenta as low moments of vorticity. The conservation laws
are compared with those obtained in the moduli space approximation for vortex
dynamics.
