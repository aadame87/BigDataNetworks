Title: On the underlying theory approach for quantum theories
Author: Jifeng Yang (Fudan Univ., Shanghai, P. R. China)
Comments: 12 pages, LaTex, no figure, explanations and speculative remarks
  about the underlying theory approach recently proposed. Comments are welcome
\\
  Some explanations and implications of the underlying theory approach for
quantum theories (QM or QFT) are discussed and suggested. This simple idea
seems to have significantly nontrivial effects for our understanding of the
quantum theories.
