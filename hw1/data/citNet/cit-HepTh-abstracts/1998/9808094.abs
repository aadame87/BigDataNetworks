  3d Chern-Simons gauge theory has a strong connection with 2d CFT and link
invariants in knot theory. We impose some constraints on the $D(2|1;\alpha)$ CS
theory in the similar context of the hamiltonian reduction of 2d superconformal
algebras. There Hilbert states in $D(2|1;\alpha)$ CS theory are partly
identified with characters of the large N=4 SCFT by their transformation
properties.
