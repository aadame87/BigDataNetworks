Title: Intersecting brane geometries
Authors: JM Figueroa-O'Farrill
Comments: 29 pages. (v2: Two new sections have been added. Paper is now more
  than 50% longer. A guided tour of the eight-dimensional geometries is
  presented along with the computational details. We have also included a
  discussion of the possible generalised self-dualities afforded by these
  geometries.)

  We present a survey of the calibrated geometries arising in the study of the
local singularity structure of supersymmetric fivebranes in M-theory. We pay
particular attention to the geometries of 4-planes in eight dimensions, for
which we present some new results as well as many details of the computations.
We also analyse the possible generalised self-dualities which these geometries
can afford.
