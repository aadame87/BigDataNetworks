  We study the absorption of a class of fields in the geometry produced by
extremal three-branes. We consider fields that do not mix with the
ten-dimensional graviton. For these fields we solve the wave equations and find
the absorption probabilities for all partial waves at leading order in the
energy. We note that in some of these cases one needs an `intermediate' region
which interpolates between flat Minkowski space at infinity and the AdS
geometry near the branes.
