Title: Numerical study of the decay amplitudes in two dimensional QCD

  After presenting a survey of theoretical results concerning the structure of
two-dimensional QCD, we present a numerical study related to the mass
eigenstates and the decay amplitudes of higher mesonic states. We discuss in
detail the fate of important dynamical points such as stability of the spectrum
and the problem of screening versus confinement in this context. We point out
differences in the large distance behaviour of the potential, which can be
responsible for the question of stability of the spectrum, as well as whether
it is finite.
