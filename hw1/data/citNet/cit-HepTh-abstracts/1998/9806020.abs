  In this technical note we describe a new (to the physics literature)
construction of bundles on Calabi-Yaus. We primarily study this construction in
the special case of K3 surfaces, for which interesting results can be obtained.
For example, we use this construction to give plausibility arguments for a
relationship between spaces of solutions of Hitchin's equations and moduli
spaces of bundles on K3s. Also, in a recent paper it was proposed by C. Vafa
that the mirror to a bundle on a Calabi-Yau n-fold is, in a particular sense, a
supersymmetric n-cycle on the mirror Calabi-Yau. We use this new construction
to observe that for the special case of K3s, Vafa's mirror data also specifies
a bundle directly on the mirror K3, and so we potentially have a duality
between bundles on any one K3 and other bundles on the mirror K3.
