Title: Canonical Quantization for the Light-Front Weyl Gauge
Author: Jerzy A. Przeszowski (IFTR PAC, Warsaw)
Comments: 18 pages, no figures
\\
  The canonical quantization on a single light front is performed for the
Abelian gauge fields with the Weyl gauge coupled with fermion field currents.
The analysis is carried separately for 1+1 dimensions and for higher
dimensions. The Gauss law, implemented weakly as the condition on states,
selects physical subspace with the Poincare covariance recovered. The
perturbative gauge field propagators are found with the ML prescription for
their spurious poles. The LF Feynman rules are found and their equivalence with
the usual equal-time perturbation for the S-matrix elements is studied for all
orders.
