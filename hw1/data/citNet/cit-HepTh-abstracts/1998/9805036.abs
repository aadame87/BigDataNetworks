  We prove that, in (2+1) dimensions, the S-wave phase shift, $ \delta_0(k)$, 
k being the c.m. momentum, vanishes as either $\delta_0 \to {c\over \ln (k/m)}
or \delta_0 \to O(k^2)$ as $k\to 0$. The constant $c$ is universal and
$c=\pi/2$. This result is established first in the framework of the
Schr\"odinger equation for a large class of potentials, second for a massive
field theory from proved analyticity and unitarity, and, finally, we look at
perturbation theory in $\phi_3^4$ and study its relation to our
non-perturbative result. The remarkable fact here is that in n-th order the
perturbative amplitude diverges like $(\ln k)^n$ as $k\to 0$, while the full
amplitude vanishes as $(\ln k)^{-1}$. We show how these two facts can be
reconciled.
