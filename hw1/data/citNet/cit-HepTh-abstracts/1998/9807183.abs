  In view of two-dimensional topological gravity coupled to matter, we study
the Seiberg-Witten theory for the low-energy behavior of N=2 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory with ADE gauge groups. We construct a new solution of the
Picard-Fuchs equations obeyed by the Seiberg-Witten periods. Our solution is
expressed as the linear sum over the infinite set of one-point functions of
gravitational descendants in $d<1$ topological strings. It turns out that our
solution provides the power series expansion around the origin of the quantum
moduli space of the Coulomb branch. For SU(N) gauge group we show how the
Seiberg-Witten periods are reconstructed from the present solution.
