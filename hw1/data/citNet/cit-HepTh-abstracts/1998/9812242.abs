  This paper is a letter-type version of hep-th/9806236. We discuss properties
of non-linear equations of motion which describe higher-spin gauge interactions
for massive spin-0 and spin-1/2 matter fields in 2+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter
space. The model is shown to have N=2 supersymmetry and to describe higher-spin
interactions of d3 N=2 massive hypermultiplets. An integrating flow is found
which reduces the full non-linear system to the free field equations via a
non-local B\"acklund-Nicolai-type mapping.
