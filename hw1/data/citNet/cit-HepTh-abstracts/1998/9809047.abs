Authors: A. Di Giacomo
Comments: 9 pages,4 figures.Presented at the Fourth Workshop on QCD, The
  American University of Paris,1-6June 1998.To appear in the Proceedings

  A discussion is made of the strategy to check dual superconductivity of the
vacuum as a mechanism of colour confinement. Recent evidence from Lattice is
reviewed.
