  We consider hidden sector supersymmetry breakdown in the strongly coupled
heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ theory of Ho\v{r}ava and Witten. Using effective
field theory methods in four dimensions, we can show that gravitational
interactions induce soft breaking terms in the observable sector that are of
order of the gravitiono mass. We apply these methods to the mechanism of
gaugino condensation at the hidden wall. Although the situation is very similar
to the weakly coupled case, there is a decisive difference concerning the
observable sector gaugino mass; with desirable phenomenological as well as
cosmological consequences.
