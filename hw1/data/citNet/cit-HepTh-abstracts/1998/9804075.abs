  In this article we review some recent developments in heterotic
compactifications. In particular we review an ``inherently toric'' description
of certain sheaves, called equivariant sheaves, that has recently been
discussed in the physics literature. We outline calculations that can be
performed with these objects, and also outline more general phenomena in moduli
spaces of sheaves.
