  In a recently developed approximation technique for quantum field theory the
standard one-loop result is used as a seed for a recursive formula that gives a
sequence of improved Gaussian approximations for the generating functional. In
this paper we work with the generic $\phi^3+\phi^4$ model in $d=0$ dimensions.
We compare the first, and simplest, approximation in the above sequence with
the one-loop and two-loop approximations, as well as the exact results
(calculated numericaly).
