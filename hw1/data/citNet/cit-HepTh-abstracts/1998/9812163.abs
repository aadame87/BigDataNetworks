  Recently we proposed a TeV-scale Supersymmetric Standard Model in which the
gauge coupling unification is as precise (at one loop) as in the MSSM, and
occurs in the TeV range. One of the key ingredients of this model is the
presence of new states neutral under $SU(3)_c\otimes SU(2)_w$ but charged under
$U(1)_Y$ whose mass scale is around that of the electroweak Higgs doublets. In
this paper we show that introduction of these states allows to gauge novel
anomaly free discrete (as well as continuous) symmetries (similar to ``lepton''
and ``baryon'' numbers) which suppress dangerous higher dimensional operators
and stabilize proton. Moreover, we argue that these gauge symmetries are
essential for successfully generating small neutrino masses via a recently
proposed higher dimensional mechanism. Furthermore, the mass hierarchy between
the up and down quarks (e.g., $t$ vs. $b$) can be explained without appealing
to large $\tan\beta$, and the $\mu$-term for the electroweak Higgs doublets (as
well as for the new states) can be generated. We also discuss various
phenomenological implications of our model which lead to predictions testable
in the present or near future collider experiments. In particular, we point out
that signatures of scenarios with high vs. low unification (string) scale might
be rather different. This suggest a possibility that the collider experiments
may distinguish between these scenarios even without a direct production of
heavy Kaluza-Klein or string states.
