  The relation between connections on 2-dimensional manifolds and holomorphic
bundles provides a new perspective on the role of classical gauge fields in
quantum field theory in two, three and four dimensions. In particular we show
that there is a close relation between unstable bundles and monopoles,
sphalerons and instantons. Some of these classical configurations emerge as
nodes of quantum vacuum states in non-confining phases of \qft which suggests a
relevant role for those configurations in the mechanism of quark confinement in
QCD.
