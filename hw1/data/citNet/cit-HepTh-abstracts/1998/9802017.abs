  We explore a novel way of deriving the effective Higgs Lagrangian from
strongly interacting vector-like gauge theories. We consider the N=1
supersymmetric extension of gauge theories and interpret the auxiliary field
associated with the low energy effective "meson" superfield as the Higgs field.
By introducing an explicit supersymmetry breaking term and computing the
one-loop effective action at the effective theory level we show that the
kinetic term for the Higgs field is generated, while the negative mass squared
term is already present at the tree level. We further propose a scenario by
which the complete Higgs potential can be generated and the fermion in the low
energy effective theory acquires a mass.
