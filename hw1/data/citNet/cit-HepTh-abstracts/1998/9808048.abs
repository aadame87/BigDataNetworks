  We consider D-branes and orientifold planes embedded in non-compact
(orbifolded) space-time. We point out that even in the non-compact cases we can
turn on non-zero (quantized) NS-NS antisymmetric B-field. In particular, we
study the effect of the B-field on four dimensional large N gauge theories from
orientifolds. Thus, in theories with both D3- and D7-branes, the effect of the
B-field is non-trivial: the number of D7-branes (of each species) is reduced
from 8 (which is the required number if the B-field is trivial) to 4. This
results in a different orientifold string theory, and, subsequently, the
corresponding large N gauge theory is also different. We explicitly construct
large N gauge theories from orientifolds with non-zero B-field backgrounds with
${\cal N}=2,1,0$ supersymmetries. These theories, just as their counterparts
without the B-field, have the property that in the large N limit computation of
any M-point correlation function reduces to the corresponding computation in
the parent ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric theory with a unitary gauge group.
