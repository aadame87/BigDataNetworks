  Supersymmetric domain walls are reviewed. The main emphasis is made on
saturated walls in strongly coupled gauge theories. The central charge of the
N=1 superalgebra appears in supersymmetric gluodynamics as a quantum anomaly. I
also consider some rather unusual general features of supersymmetric domain
walls.
