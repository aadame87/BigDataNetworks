  Open branes ending on other branes, which may be referred to as the host
branes, are studied in the superembedding formalism. The open brane, host brane
and the target space in which they are both embedded are all taken to be
supermanifolds. It is shown that the superspace constraints satisfied by the
open brane are sufficient to determine the corresponding superspace constraints
for the host branes, whose dynamics are determined by these constraints. As a
byproduct, one also obtains information about the boundary of the open brane
propagating in the host brane.
