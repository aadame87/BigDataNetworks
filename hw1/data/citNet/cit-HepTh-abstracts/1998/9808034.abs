  The elucidation of the properties of the instantons in the topologically
trivial sector has been a long-standing puzzle. Here we claim that the
properties can be summarized in terms of the geometrical structure in the
configuration space, the valley. The evidence for this claim is presented in
various ways. The conventional perturbation theory and the non-perturbative
calculation are unified, and the ambiguity of the Borel transform of the
perturbation series is removed. A `proof' of Bogomolny's ``trick'' is
presented, which enables us to go beyond the dilute-gas approximation. The
prediction of the large order behavior of the perturbation theory is confirmed
by explicit calculations, in some cases to the 478-th order. A new type of
supersymmetry is found as a by-product, and our result is shown to be
consistent with the non-renormalization theorem. The prediction of the energy
levels is confirmed with numerical solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.
