  We systematically study the exclusion statistics for quasi-particles for
Conformal Field Theory spectra by employing a method based on recursion
relations for truncated spectra. Our examples include generalized fermions in
c<1 unitary minimal models, Z_k parafermions, and spinons for the su(n)_1,
so(n)_1 and sp(2n)_1 Wess-Zumino-Witten models. For some of the latter examples
we present explicit expressions for finitized affine characters and for the
N-spinon decomposition of affine characters.
