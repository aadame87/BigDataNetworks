  We analyse the ultraviolet divergencies in the ground state energy for a
penetrable sphere and a dielectric ball. We argue that for massless fields
subtraction of the ``empty space'' or the ``unbounded medium'' contribution is
not enough to make the ground state energy finite whenever the heat kernel
coefficient $a_2$ is not zero. It turns out that $a_2\ne 0$ for a penetrable
sphere, a general dielectric background and the dielectric ball. To our
surprise, for more singular configurations, as in the presence of sharp
boundaries, the heat kernel coefficients behave to some extend better than in
the corresponding smooth cases, making, for instance, the dilute dielectric
ball a well defined problem.
