  The soldering mechanism is a new technique to work with distinct
manifestations of dualities that incorporates interference effects, leading to
new physical results that includes quantum contributions. This approach was
used to investigate the cases of electromagnetic dualities, and $D\geq 2$
bosonization. In the former context this technique is applied for the quantum
mechanical harmonic oscillator, the scalar field theory in two dimensions and
the Maxwell theory in four dimensions. The soldered actions in any dimension
leads to a master action which is duality invariant under a much bigger set of
symmetries. The effects of coupling to gravity are also elaborated. In the
later context, a technique is developed that solders the dual aspects of some
symmetry following from the bosonisation of two distinct fermionic models,
leading to new results which cannot be otherwise obtained. Exploiting this
technique, the two dimensional chiral determinants with opposite chirality are
soldered to reproduce either the usual gauge invariant expression leading to
the Schwinger model or, alternatively, the Thirring model. Likewise, two
apparently independent three dimensional massive Thirring models with same
coupling but opposite mass signatures, in the long wavelegth limit, combine by
the process of bosonisation and soldering to yield an effective massive Maxwell
theory. The current bosonisation formulas are given, both in the original
independent formulation as well as the effective theory, and shown to yield
consistent results for the correlation functions.
