  We discuss theories containing higher-order forms in various dimensions. We
explain how Chern--Simons-type theories of forms can be defined from TQFTs in
one less dimension. We also exhibit new TQFTs with interacting Yang--Mills
fields and higher--order forms. They are obtained by the dimensional reduction
of TQFTs whose gauge functions are free self-duality equations. Interactions
are due to the gauging of global internal symmetries after dimensional
reduction. We list possible symmetries and give a brief discussion on the
possible relation of such systems to interacting field theories.
