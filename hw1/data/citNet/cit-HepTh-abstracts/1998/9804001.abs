  By exploiting the relation between Fredholm modules and the
Segal-Shale-Stinespring version of canonical quantization, and taking as
starting point the first-quantized fields described by Connes' axioms for
noncommutative spin geometries, a Hamiltonian framework for fermion quantum
fields over noncommutative manifolds is introduced. We analyze the ultraviolet
behaviour of second-quantized fields over noncommutative 3-tori, and discuss
what behaviour should be expected on other noncommutative spin manifolds.
