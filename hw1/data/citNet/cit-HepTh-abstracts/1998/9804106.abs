  We present a non-singular instanton describing the creation of an open
universe with a compactified extra dimension. The four dimensional section of
this solution is a singular instanton of the type introduced by Hawking and
Turok. The ``singularity'' is viewed in five dimensions as a smooth bubble of
``nothing'' which eats up a portion of spacetime as it expands. Flat space with
a compact extra dimension is shown to be gravitationally metastable, but
sufficiently long lived if the size of the extra dimension is large compared
with the Planck length.
