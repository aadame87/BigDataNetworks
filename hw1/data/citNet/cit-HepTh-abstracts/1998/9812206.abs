  We show how a theorem of Sullivan provides a precise mathematical statement
of a 3d holographic principle, that is, the hyperbolic structure of a certain
class of 3d manifolds is completely determined in terms of the corresponding
Teichmuller space of the boundary. We explore the consequences of this theorem
in the context of the Euclidean BTZ black hole in three dimensions.
