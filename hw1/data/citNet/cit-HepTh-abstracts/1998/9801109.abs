  We describe some of the novel 6d quantum field theories which have been
discovered in studies of string duality. The role these theories (and their 4d
descendants) may play in alleviating the vacuum degeneracy problem in string
theory is reviewed. The DLCQ of these field theories is presented as one
concrete way of formulating them, independent of string theory.
