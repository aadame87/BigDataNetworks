  Poisson-Lie T-duality in quantum N=2 superconformal WZNW models is
considered. The Poisson-Lie T-duality transformation rules of the
super-Kac-Moody algebra currents are found from the conjecture that, as in the
classical case, the quantum Poisson-Lie T-duality is given by an automorphism
which interchanges the isotropic subalgebras of the underlying Manin triple of
the model. It is shown that quantum Poisson-Lie T-duality acts on the
generators of the N=2 super-Virasoro algebra of the quantum models as a mirror
symmetry acts: in one of the chirality sectors it is trivial transformation
while in another chirality sector it changes the sign of the U(1) current and
interchanges the spin-3/2 currents. A generalization of Poisson-Lie T-duality
for the Kazama-Suzuki models is proposed. It is shown that quantum Poisson-Lie
T-duality acts in these models as a mirror symmetry also.
