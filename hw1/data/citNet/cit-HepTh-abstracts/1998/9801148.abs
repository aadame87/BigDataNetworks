  A classical model of N=2, D=3 fractional spin superparticle (superanyon) is
presented, whose first-quantization procedure combines the Berezin quantization
for the superspin degrees of freedom and the canonical quantization for the
space-time ones. To provide the supersymmetry for the quantised theory, certain
quantum corrections are required to the N=2 supersymmetry generators as
compared to the Berezin procedure. The renormalized generators are found and
the first quantised theory of N=2 superanyon is constructed.
