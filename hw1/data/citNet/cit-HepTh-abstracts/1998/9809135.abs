  A canonical action describing the interaction of chiral gauge fields in D=6
Minkowski space-time is constructed. In a particular partial gauge fixing it
reduces to the action found by Perry and Schwarz. The additional gauge
symmetries are used to show the off-shell equivalence of the dimensional
reduction to D=5 Minkowski space-time of the chiral gauge field canonical
action and the Born-Infeld canonical action describing an interacting D=5
Abelian vector field. Its extension to improve the on-shell equivalence
arguments of dual D-brane actions to off-shell ones is discussed.
