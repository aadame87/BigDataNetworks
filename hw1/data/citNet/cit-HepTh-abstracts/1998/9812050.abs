  The non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) is applied to analysis of
tunnelling in quantum mechanics. The vacuum energy and the energy gap of
anharmonic oscillators are evaluated by solving the local potential
approximated Wegner-Houghton equation (LPA W-H eqn.). We find that our results
are very good in a strong coupling region, but not in a very weak coupling
region, where the dilute gas instanton calculation works very well. So it seems
that in analysis of quantum tunnelling, the dilute gas instanton and LPA W-H
eqn. play complementary roles to each other. We also analyze the supersymmetric
quantum mechanics and see if the dynamical supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking is
described by NPRG method.
