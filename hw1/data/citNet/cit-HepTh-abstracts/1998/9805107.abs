  We review M-theory description of 4d N=2 SQCD. Configurations of M-theory
fivebranes relevant to describe the moduli spaces of the Coulomb and Higgs
branches are studied using the Taub-NUT geometry. Minimal area membranes
related with the BPS states of N=2 SQCD are given explicitly. They almost
saturate the BPS bounds. The deviation from the bounds is due to their boundary
condition constrained by the fivebrane. The electric-magnetic duality at the
baryonic branch root is also examined from the M-theory viewpoint. In this
course, novel concepts such as creation of brane and exchange of branes in Type
II theory are explained in the framework of M-theory.
