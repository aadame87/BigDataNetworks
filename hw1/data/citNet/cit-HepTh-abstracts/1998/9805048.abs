  The field theories on the surface of non-supersymmetric D-brane constructions
are identified. By moving to M-theory a semi-classical, strong coupling
expansion to the IR non-supersymmetric gauge dynamics is obtained. The solution
is consistent with the formation of a quark condensate but there is evidence
that in moving to strong coupling scalar degrees of freedom have not decoupled.
