  Motivated by the coupling unification problem, we propose a novel extension
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. One of the predictions of this
extension is existence of new states neutral under SU(3)_c X SU(2)_w but
charged under U(1)_Y. The mass scale for these new states can be around the
mass scale of the electroweak Higgs doublets. This suggests a possibility of
their detection in the present or near future collider experiments. Unification
of gauge couplings in this extension is as precise (at one loop) as in the
MSSM, and can occur in the TeV range.
