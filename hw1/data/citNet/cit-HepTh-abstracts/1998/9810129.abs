  It has recently been suggested that in certain special nonsupersymmetric type
II string compactifications, at least the first two perturbative contributions
to the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ vanish. Support for perturbative
vanishing beyond 1-loop (as well as evidence for the absence of some
nonperturbative contributions) has come from duality arguments. There was also
a direct 2-loop computation which was incomplete; in this note we explain the
deficiency of the previous 2-loop calculation and discuss the complete 2-loop
computation in two different models. The corrected analysis yields a vanishing
2-loop contribution to $\Lambda$ in these models.
