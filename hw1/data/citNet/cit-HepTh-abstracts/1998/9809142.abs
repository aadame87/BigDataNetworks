  In this paper we study three point functions of the Type II superstring
involving one graviton and two massive states, focusing in particular on the
spin-7/2 fermions at the first mass level. Defining a gravitational quadrupole
``h-factor'', we find that the non-minimal interactions of string states in
general are parametrized by $h\ne1$, in contrast to the preferred field theory
value of h=1 (for tree-level unitarity). This difference arises from the fact
that consistent gravitational interactions of strings are related to the
presence of a complete tower of massive states, not present in the ordinary
field theory case.
