  Using the correlation function of chiral vertex operators of the Coulomb gas
model, we find the Laughlin wavefunctions of quantum Hall effect, with filling
factor $\nu =1/m$, on Riemann sufaces with Poincare metric. The same is done
for quasihole wavefunctions. We also discuss their plasma analogy.
