  By following Seiberg's prescriptions on DLCQ of $M$ theory, we give the
background geometries of DLCQ supergravity associated with $N$ sector of DLCQ
of $M$ theory on $T^p$ with vanishingly small radii. Most of these are the
product of anti-de Sitter spacetimes and spheres, which have been found as the
spontaneous compactifications of eleven dimensional supergravity long time ago
and also are revisited recently by Maldacena by considering the near horizon
geometry of various D-branes in appropriate limit. Those geometries are
maximally symmetric and have full 32 supersymmetries of eleven dimensional
supergravity, which agrees with the number of supersymmetries of DLCQ of $M$
theory. This suggests that DLCQ of $M$ theory is the $M$/string theory on these
nontrivial background.
