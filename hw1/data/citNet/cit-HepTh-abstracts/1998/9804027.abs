  We consider supersymmetric gauge theories with impurities in various
dimensions. These systems arise in the study of intersecting branes. Unlike
conventional gauge theories, the Higgs branch of an impurity theory can have
compact directions. For models with eight supercharges, the Higgs branch is a
hyperKahler manifold given by the moduli space of solutions of certain
differential equations. These equations are the dimensional reductions of
self-duality equations with boundary conditions determined by the impurities.
They can also be interpreted as Nahm transforms of self-duality equations on
toroidally compactified spaces. We discuss the application of our results to
the light-cone formulation of Yang-Mills theories and to the solution of
certain N=2 d=4 gauge theories.
