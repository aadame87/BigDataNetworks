  It has recently been shown that the Matrix model and supergravity give the
same predictions for three graviton scattering. This contradicts an earlier
claim in the literature (hep-th/9710174). We explain the error in this earlier
work, and go on to show that certain terms in the $n$-graviton scattering
amplitude involving $v^{2n}$ are given correctly by the Matrix model. The
Matrix model also generates certain $v^6$ terms in four graviton scattering at
three loops, which do not seem to have any counterparts in supergravity. The
connection of these results with nonrenormalization theorems is discussed.
