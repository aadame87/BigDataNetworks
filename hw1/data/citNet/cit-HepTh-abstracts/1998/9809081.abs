  We study the problem of a Dirac field in the background of an Aharonov-Bohm
flux string. We exclude the origin by imposing spectral boundary conditions at
a finite radius then shrinked to zero. Thus, we obtain a behaviour of
eigenfunctions which is compatible with the self-adjointness of the radial
Hamiltonian and the invariance under integer translations of the reduced flux.
After confining the theory to a finite region, we check the consistency with
the index theorem, and evaluate its vacuum fermionic number and Casimir energy.
