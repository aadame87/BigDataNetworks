  The genesis of Feynman's original approach to QED is reviewed. The main ideas
of his original presentation at the Pocono Conference are discussed and
compared with the ones involved in his action-at-distance formulation of
classical electrodynamics. The role of the de Sitter group in Feynman's
visualization of space-time processes is pointed out.
