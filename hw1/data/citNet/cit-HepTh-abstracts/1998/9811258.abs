  We study D-branes on a three complex dimensional nonabelian orbifold ${\bf
C}^3/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of SU(3). We present general
formulae necessary to obtain quiver diagrams which represent the gauge group
and the spectrum of the D-brane worldvolume theory for dihedral-like subgroups
$\Delta(3n^2)$ and $\Delta(6n^2)$. It is found that the quiver diagrams have a
similar structure to webs of branes.
