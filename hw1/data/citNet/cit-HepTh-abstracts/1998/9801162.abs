Title: Radiation of RR states from NS Fivebranes
Authors: S. P. de Alwis
Comments: Some comments on the use of the self-consistent versus the flat
  metric on the brane added. Typos corrected. 9 pages, Latex
Report-no: IASSNS-HEP-98/5

  We show that the recent observation that near extremal NS fivebranes decay
due to Hawking radiation, can be understood in terms of their coupling to RR
states which does not vanish even as the string coupling goes to zero.
