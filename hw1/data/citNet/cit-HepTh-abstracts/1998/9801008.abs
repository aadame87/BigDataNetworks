  A string cosmology scenario ("pre-big-bang") postulates that the evolution of
the Universe starts from a state of very small curvature and coupling,
undergoes a long phase of dilaton-driven kinetic inflation and at some later
time joins smoothly standard radiation dominated cosmological evolution, thus
giving rise to a singularity free inflationary cosmology. I report on recent
progress in understanding some outstanding issues such as initial conditions,
graceful exit transition and generation of inhomogeneity perturbations.
