Title: Comment on "The relativistic particle with curvature and torsion of
  world trajectory"

  Gogilidze and Surovtsev have claimed recently (hep-th/9809191) that the
tachyonic sector can be removed from the spectrum of the relativistic particle
with curvature and torsion by a proper gauge choice. We show that the mass-spin
dependence obtained by them is incorrect and point out that their gauge surface
does not cross all the gauge orbits. We discuss the nature of the tachyonic
sector of the model and argue why it cannot be removed by any gauge fixing
procedure.
