  The implementation of supersymmetry transformations by Hilbert space
operators is discussed in the framework of supersymmetric C$^*$--dynamical
systems. It is shown that the only states admitting such an implementation are
pure supersymmetric ground states or mixtures and elementary excitations
thereof. Faithful states, such as KMS--states, are never supersymmetric.
