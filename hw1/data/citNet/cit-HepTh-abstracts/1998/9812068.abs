  The perturbative prepotential and the K\"ahler metric of the vector
multiplets of the N=2 effective low-energy heterotic strings is calculated
directly in N=1 six-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the heterotic
string vacua. This method provides the solution for the one loop correction to
the N=2 vector multiplet prepotential for compactifications of the heterotic
string for any rank three and four models, as well for compactifications on
$K_3 \times T^2$. In addition, we complete previous calculations, derived from
string amplitudes, by deriving the differential equation for the third
derivative of the prepotential with respect of the usual complex structure U
moduli of the $T^2$ torus. Moreover, we calculate the one loop prepotential,
using its modular properties, for N=2 compactifications of the heterotic string
exhibiting modular groups similar with those appearing in N=2 sectors of N=1
orbifolds based on non-decomposable torus lattices and on N=2 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills.
