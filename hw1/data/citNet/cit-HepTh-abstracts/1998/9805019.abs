  S-duality symmetry of type IIB string theory predicts the existence of a
stable non-BPS state on an orbifold five plane of the type IIB theory if the
orbifold group is generated by the simultaneous action of (-1)^{F_L} and the
reversal of sign of the four coordinates transverse to the orbifold plane. We
calculate the mass of this state by starting from a pair of D-strings carrying
the same charge as this state, and then identifying the point in the moduli
space where this pair develops a tachyonic mode, signalling the appearance of a
bound state of this configuration into the non-BPS state.
