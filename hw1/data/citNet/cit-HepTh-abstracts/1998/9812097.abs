  We show that a system of parallel D3 branes near a conifold singularity can
be mapped onto an intersecting configuration of orthogonal branes in type IIA
string theory. Using this brane configuration, we analyze the Higgs moduli
space of the associated field theory. The dimension of the Higgs moduli space
is computed from a geometrical analysis of the conifold singularity. Our
results provide evidence for an extended s-rule. In addition, a discrepancy
between the prediction of the brane configuration and the result obtained from
a geometrical anaysis is noted. This discrepancy is traced back to worldsheet
instanton effects.
