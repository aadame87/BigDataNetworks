  We study the Dirac sea in the presence of external chiral and
scalar/pseudoscalar potentials. In preparation, a method is developed for
calculating the advanced and retarded Green's functions in an expansion around
the light cone. For this, we first expand all Feynman diagrams and then
explicitly sum up the perturbation series. The light-cone expansion expresses
the Green's functions as an infinite sum of line integrals over the external
potential and its partial derivatives.
  The Dirac sea is decomposed into a causal and a non-causal contribution. The
causal contribution has a light-cone expansion which is closely related to the
light-cone expansion of the Green's functions; it describes the singular
behavior of the Dirac sea in terms of nested line integrals along the light
cone. The non-causal contribution, on the other hand, is, to every order in
perturbation theory, a smooth function in position space.
