  We show that, in the region where monopoles are well separated, the
L^2-metric on the moduli space of n-monopoles is exponentially close to the
T^n-invariant hyperk\"ahler metric proposed by Gibbons and Manton. The proof is
based on a description of the Gibbons-Manton metric as a metric on a certain
moduli space of solutions to Nahm's equations, and on twistor methods. In
particular, we show how the twistor description of monopole metrics determines
the asymptotic metric.
