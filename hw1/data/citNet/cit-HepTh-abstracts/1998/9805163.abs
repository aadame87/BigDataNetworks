  It is observed that the magnetic charges of classical monopole solutions in
Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with non-abelian unbroken gauge group $H$ are in
one-to-one correspondence with coherent states of a dual or magnetic group
$\tilde H$. In the spirit of the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive conjecture this
observation is interpreted as evidence for a hidden magnetic symmetry of
Yang-Mills theory. SU(3) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with unbroken gauge group U(2)
is studied in detail. The action of the magnetic group on semi-classical states
is given explicitly. Investigations of dyonic excitations show that electric
and magnetic symmetry are never manifest at the same time: Non-abelian magnetic
charge obstructs the realisation of electric symmetry and vice-versa. On the
basis of this fact the charge sectors in the theory are classified and their
fusion rules are discussed. Non-abelian electric-magnetic duality is formulated
as a map between charge sectors. Coherent states obey particularly simple
fusion rules, and in the set of coherent states S-duality can be formulated as
an SL(2,Z)-mapping between sectors which leaves the fusion rules invariant.
