  We show that the attempt to introduce all of the discrete space-time
transformations into the spinor representation of the Lorentz group as wholly
independent transformations (as in the vectorial representation) leads to an
8-component spinor representation in general. The first indications seem to
imply that CPT can be violated in this formulation without going outside of
field theory. However one needs further study to reach a final conclusion.
