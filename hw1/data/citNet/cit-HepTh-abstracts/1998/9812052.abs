  In these lectures, we present cosmological vacuum solutions of Horava-Witten
theory and discuss their physical properties. We begin by deriving the
five-dimensional effective action of strongly coupled heterotic string theory
by performing a reduction, on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, of M-theory on S1/Z2.
The effective theory is shown to be a gauged version of five-dimensional N=1
supergravity coupled, for simplicity, to the universal hypermultiplet and
four-dimensional boundary theories with gauge and universal gauge matter
fields. The static vacuum of the theory is a pair of BPS three-brane domain
walls. We show that this five-dimensional theory, together with the domain wall
vacuum solution, provides the correct starting point for early universe
cosmology in Horava-Witten theory. Relevant cosmological solutions are those
associated with the BPS domain wall vacuum. Such solutions must be
inhomogeneous, depending on the orbifold coordinate as well as on time. We
present two examples of this new type of cosmological solution, obtained by
separation of variables. The first example represents the analog of a rolling
radii solution with the radii specifying the geometry of the domain wall pair.
This is generalized in the second example to include a nontrivial Ramond-Ramond
scalar.
