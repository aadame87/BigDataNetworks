  In order to get the general framework describing a nonlocalizable object
beyond the bilocal field theory early proposed by Markov and Yukawa, the
quantization of space-time is reconsidered and further developed. Space-time
quantities are there not only noncommutative with U-field describing the
nonlocalizable object, as in the bilocal field theory, but also become
noncommutative among themselves. Under the U-field representation, where the
basis vectors of representation are chosen to be eigenvectors of operator U,
space-time quantities get a matrix representation of infinite dimension in
general. Field equation is considered, which determines the relation between
space-time quantities and U-field. The possible inner relation between the
recent topics of matrix model in superstring theory and the present approach is
discussed.
