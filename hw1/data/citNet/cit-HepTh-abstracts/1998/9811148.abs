  We study a simple system that comprises all main features of critical
gravitational collapse, originally discovered by Choptuik and discussed in many
subsequent publications. These features include universality of phenomena,
mass-scaling relations, self-similarity, symmetry between super-critical and
sub-critical solutions, etc.
   The system we consider is a stationary membrane (representing a domain wall)
in a static gravitational field of a black hole. For a membrane that spreads to
infinity, the induced 2+1 geometry is asymptotically flat. Besides solutions
with Minkowski topology there exists also solutions with the induced metric and
topology of a 2+1 dimensional black hole. By changing boundary conditions at
infinity, one finds that there is a transition between these two families. This
transition is critical and it possesses all the above-mentioned properties of
critical gravitational collapse. It is remarkable that characteristics of this
transition can be obtained analytically. In particular, we find exact
analytical expressions for scaling exponents and wiggle-periods.
   Our results imply that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is far
more general than one might expect.
