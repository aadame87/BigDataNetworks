  We consider a simple action for a fractional spin particle and a path
integral representation for the propagator is obtained in a gauge such that the
constraint embodied in the Lagrangian is not an obstacle. We obtain a
propagator for the particle in a constant electromagnetic field via the path
integral representation over velocities, which is characterized by arbitrary
boundary conditions and the absence of time derivatives following integration
over bosonic variables.
