  Since the Maxwell theory of electromagnetic phenomena is a gauge theory, it
is quite important to evaluate the zero-point energy of the quantized
electromagnetic field by a careful assignment of boundary conditions on the
potential and on the ghost fields. Recent work by the authors has shown that,
for a perfectly conducting spherical shell, it is precisely the contribution of
longitudinal and normal modes of the potential which enables one to reproduce
the result first due to Boyer. This is obtained provided that one works with
the Lorenz gauge-averaging functional, and with the help of the Feynman choice
for a dimensionless gauge parameter. For arbitrary values of the gauge
parameter, however, covariant and non-covariant gauges lead to an entangled
system of three eigenvalue equations. Such a problem is crucial both for the
foundations and for the applications of quantum field theory.
