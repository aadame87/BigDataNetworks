  We give a short introduction to and a partial review of the work on the
calculation of Wilson loops and $Q\bar Q$-potentials via the conjectured
AdS/CFT duality. Included is a discussion of the relative weight of the stringy
correction to the target space background versus the correction by the quantum
fluctuations of the string world sheet.
