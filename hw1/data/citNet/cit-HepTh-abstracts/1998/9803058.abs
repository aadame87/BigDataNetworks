  We present the way the Lorentz invariant canonical partition function for
Matrix Theory as a light-cone formulation of M-theory can be computed. We
explicitly show how when the eleventh dimension is decompactified, the N = 1
eleven dimensional SUGRA partition function appears. We also provide a high
temperature expansion which captures some structure of the canonical partition
function when interactions amongst D-particles are on. The connection with the
semi-classical computations thermalizing the open superstrings attached to a
D-particle is also clarified through a Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Some
ideas about how Matrix Theory would describe the complementary degrees of
freedom of the massless content of eleven dimensional SUGRA are discussed.
Comments about possible connections to black hole physics are also made.
