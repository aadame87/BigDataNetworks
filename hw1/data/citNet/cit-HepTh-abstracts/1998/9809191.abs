  Local symmetries of the action for a relativistic particle with curvature and
torsion of its world curve in the (2+1)-dimensional space-time are studied.
With the help of the method, worked out recently by the authors (Phys.Rev.,
D56, 1135, 1142 (1997)), first the local-symmetry transformations are obtained
both in the phase and configuration space. At the classical level, the
dependence of the particle mass on the parameters of curvature and torsion and
the Regge trajectory are obtained. It is shown that the tachyonic sector can be
removed by a proper gauge choice.
