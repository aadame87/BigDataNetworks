  A simple method is proposed to construct the spectral zeta functions required
for calculating the electromagnetic vacuum energy with boundary conditions
given on a sphere or on an infinite cylinder. When calculating the Casimir
energy in this approach no exact divergencies appear and no renormalization is
needed. The starting point of the consideration is the representation of the
zeta functions in terms of contour integral, further the uniform asymptotic
expansion of the Bessel function is essentially used. After the analytic
continuation, needed for calculating the Casimir energy, the zeta functions are
presented as infinite series containing the Riemann zeta function with rapidly
falling down terms. The spectral zeta functions are constructed exactly for a
material ball and infinite cylinder placed in an uniform endless medium under
the condition that the velocity of light does not change when crossing the
interface. As a special case, perfectly conducting spherical and cylindrical
shells are also considered in the same line. In this approach one succeeds,
specifically, in justifying, in mathematically rigorous way, the appearance of
the contribution to the Casimir energy for cylinder which is proportional to
$\ln (2\pi)$.
