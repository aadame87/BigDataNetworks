  As a continuation of our previous work on the multi-body forces of
D-particles in supergravity and Matrix theory, we investigate the problem of
motion. We show that the scattering of D-particles including recoil derived in
Matrix theory is precisely reproduced by supergravity with the discrete
light-cone prescription up to the second order in 11 dimensional Newton
constant. An intimate connection of recoil and Galilei invariance in
supergravity is pointed out and elucidated.
