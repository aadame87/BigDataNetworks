  This paper analyses the Noether symmetries and the corresponding conservation
laws for Chern-Simons Lagrangians in dimension $d=3$. In particular, we find an
expression for the superpotential of Chern-Simons gravity. As a by-product the
general discussion of superpotentials for 3rd order natural and quasi-natural
theories is also given.
