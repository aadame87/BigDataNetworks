  In these lectures we describe the construction of a gauge invariant
renormalization group equation for pure non-Abelian gauge theory. In the
process, a non-perturbative gauge invariant continuum Wilsonian effective
action is precisely defined. The formulation makes sense without gauge fixing
and thus manifest gauge invariance may be preserved at all stages. In the large
N limit (of SU(N) gauge theory) the effective action simplifies: it may be
expressed through a path integral for a single particle whose trajectory
describes a Wilson loop. Regularization is achieved with the help of a set of
Pauli-Villars fields whose formulation follows naturally in this picture.
Finally, we show how the one loop beta function was computed, for the first
time without any gauge fixing.
