  We study the manifestly covariant three-dimensional symmetric Chern-Simons
action in terms of the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization method. We find that the
Lorentz covariant gauge fixed version of this action is reduced to the usual
Chern-Simons type action after a proper field redefinition. Furthermore, the
renormalizability of the symmetric Chern-Simons theory turns out to be the same
as that of the original Chern-Simons theory.
