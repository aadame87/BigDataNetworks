  The light-cone Hamiltonian approach is applied to the super D2-brane, and the
equivalent area--preserving and U(1) gauge-invariant effective Lagrangian,
which is quadratic in the U(1) gauge field, is derived. The latter is
recognised to be that of the three-dimensional U(1) gauge theory, interacting
with matter supermultiplets, in a special external induced supergravity metric
and the gravitino field, depending on matter fields. The duality between this
theory and 11d supermembrane theory is demonstrated in the light-cone gauge.
