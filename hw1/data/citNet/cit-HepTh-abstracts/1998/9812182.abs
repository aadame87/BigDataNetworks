  Within the operator manifold approach (part I, hep-th/9812181) we derive the
Gell-Mann-Nishijima relation and flavour group, whereas the leptons are
particles with integer electric and leptonic charges and free of confinement,
while quarks carry fractional electric and baryonic charges and imply the
confinement. We consider the unified electroweak interactions with small number
of free parameters, exploit the background of the local expanded symmetry
$SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ and P-violation. The Weinberg mixing angle is shown to have
fixed value at $30^{o}$. The Higgs bosons arise on an analogy of the Cooper
pairs in superconductivity. Within the present microscopic approach we predict
the Kobayashi-Maskawa quark flavour mixing; the appearance of the CP-violation
phase; derive the mass-spectrum of leptons and quarks, as well as other
emerging particles, and also some useful relations between their masses.
