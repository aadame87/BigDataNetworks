Title: Light-Cone Dynamics of Particles and Fields
Authors: Thomas Heinzl

  Physics, University of Regensburg

  We review the foundations as well as a number of important applications of
light-cone dynamics. Topics covered are: relativistic particle dynamics,
reparametrization invariance, Dirac's front form, light-cone quantization of
fields via Schwinger's quantum action principle or Faddeev-Jackiw reduction,
light-cone vacuum and wave functions, zero modes and spontaneous symmetry
breaking, `t Hooft and Schwinger model, and the light-cone wave function of the
pion.
