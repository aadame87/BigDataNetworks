  It is shown that the orbifold of type IIB string theory by (-1)^{F_L} I_4
admits a stable non-BPS Dirichlet particle that is stuck on the orbifold fixed
plane. It is charged under the SO(2) gauge group coming from the twisted
sector, and transforms as a long multiplet of the D=6 supersymmetry algebra.
This suggests that it is the strong coupling dual of the perturbative stable
non-BPS state that appears in the orientifold of type IIB by \Omega I_4.
