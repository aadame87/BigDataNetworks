  The field equations for both generic bosonic and generic locally
supersymmetric 2D dilatonic gravity theories in the absence of matter are
written as free differential algebras. This constitutes a generalization of the
gauge theoretic formulation. Moreover, it is shown that the condition of free
differential algebra can be used to obtain the equations in the locally
supersymmetric case. Using this formulation, the general solution of the field
equations is found in the language of differential forms. The relation with the
ordinary formulation and the coupling to supersymmetric conformal matter are
also studied.
