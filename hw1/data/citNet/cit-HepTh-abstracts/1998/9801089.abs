  Boundary conditions changing operators have played an important role in
conformal field theory. Here, we study their equivalent in the case where a
mass scale is introduced, in an integrable way, either in the bulk or at the
boundary. More precisely, we propose an axiomatic approach to determine the
general scalar products ${}_b<\theta_1, ... ,\theta_m||\theta'_1, ... ,\theta'_{n}>_a$
between asymptotic states
in the Hilbert spaces with $a$ and $b$ boundary conditions respectively, and
compute these scalar products explicitely in the case of the Ising and
sinh-Gordon models with a mass and a boundary interaction. These quantities can
be used to study statistical systems with inhomogeneous boundary conditions,
and, more interestingly maybe, dynamical problems in quantum impurity problems.
As an example, we obtain a series of new exact results for the transition
probability in the double well problem of dissipative quantum mechanics.
