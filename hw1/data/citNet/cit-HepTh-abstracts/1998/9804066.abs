  In this paper we conjecture a reformulation of the monomial-divisor mirror
map for (2,2) mirror symmetry, valid at a boundary of the moduli space, that is
easily extended to also include tangent bundle deformations -- an important
step towards understanding (0,2) mirror symmetry. We check our conjecture in a
few simple cases, and thereby illustrate how to perform calculations using a
description of sheaves recently published by Knutson, Sharpe.
