  Previous work involving Born-regulated gravity theories in two dimensions is
extended to four dimensions. The action we consider has two dimensionful
parameters. Black hole solutions are studied for typical values of these
parameters. For masses above a critical value determined in terms of these
parameters, the event horizon persists. For masses below this critical value,
the event horizon disappears, leaving a ``bare mass'', though of course no
singularity.
