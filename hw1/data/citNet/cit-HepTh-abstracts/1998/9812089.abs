  In a recent paper we considered the type 0 string theories, obtained from the
ten-dimensional closed NSR string by a GSO projection which excludes space-time
fermions, and studied the low-energy dynamics of N coincident D-branes. This
led us to conjecture that the four-dimensional SU(N) gauge theory coupled to 6
adjoint massless scalars is dual to a background of type 0 theory carrying N
units of R-R 5-form flux and involving a tachyon condensate. The tachyon
background leads to a ``soft breaking'' of conformal invariance, and we derived
the corresponding renormalization group equation. Minahan has subsequently
found its asymptotic solution for weak coupling and showed that the coupling
exhibits logarithmic flow, as expected from the asymptotic freedom of the dual
gauge theory. We study this solution in more detail and identify the effect of
the 2-loop beta function. We also demonstrate the existence of a fixed point at
infinite coupling. Just like the fixed point at zero coupling, it is
characterized by the AdS_5\times S^5 Einstein frame metric. We argue that there
is a RG trajectory extending all the way from the zero coupling fixed point in
the UV to the infinite coupling fixed point in the IR.
