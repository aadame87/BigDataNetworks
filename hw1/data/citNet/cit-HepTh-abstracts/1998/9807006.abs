  We show that the full global symmetry groups of all the D-dimensional maximal
supergravities can be described in terms of the closure of the internal general
coordinate transformations of the toroidal compactifications of D=11
supergravity and of type IIB supergravity, with type IIA/IIB T-duality
providing an intertwining between the two pictures. At the quantum level, the
part of the U-duality group that corresponds to the surviving discretised
internal general coordinate transformations in a given picture leaves the
internal torus invariant, while the part that is not described by internal
general coordinate transformations can have the effect of altering the size or
shape of the internal torus. For example, M-theory compactified on a large
torus T^n can be related by duality to a compactification on a small torus, if
and only if n\ge 3. We also discuss related issues in the toroidal
compactification of the self-dual string to D=4. An appendix includes the
complete results for the toroidal reduction of the bosonic sector of type IIB
supergravity to arbitrary dimensions D\ge3.
