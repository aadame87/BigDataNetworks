  The spontaneous generation of uniform magnetic condensate in $QED_3$ gives
rise to ferromagnetic domain walls at the electroweak phase transition. These
ferromagnetic domain walls are caracterized by vanishing effective surface
energy density avoiding, thus, the domain wall problem. Moreover we find that
the domain walls generate a magnetic field $B \simeq 10^{24} Gauss$ at the
electroweak scale which account for the seed field in the so called dynamo
mechanism for the cosmological primordial magnetic field. We find that the
annihilation processes of walls with size $R \simeq 10^5 Km$ could release an
energy of order $10^{52} erg$ indicating the invisible ferromagnetic walls as
possible compact sources of Gamma Ray Bursts.
