  We calculate the baryon mass in N=4 large $N$ gauge theory by means of
AdS/CFT correspondence and show that it is a truly bound state, at least in
some situations. We find that a phase transition occurs at a critical
temperature. Furthermore, we find there are bound states of W-bosons in the
Higgs phase, where the gauge group is broken to SU(N_1)xSU(N_2).
