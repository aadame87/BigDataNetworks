Title: Field Theory Dynamics from Branes in String Theory
Authors: Andreas Karch
Comments: 104 pages, LaTeX2e; based on PhD Thesis, Humboldt University, Berlin
\\
  I review certain aspects of Hanany-Witten setups and other approaches used to
embed (and solve) gauge theories in string theory. Applications covered include
dualities in 4 and 3 dimensions, fixed points in 6 dimensions, phase
transitions between different geometric backgrounds and dualities between
branes and geometry.
