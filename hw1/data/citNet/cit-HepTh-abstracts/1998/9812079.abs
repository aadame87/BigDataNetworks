  A relation between confinement and Maldacena conjecture is briefly discussed.
The gauge symmetry enhancement for two coincident D-6-branes is analyzed from
the viewpoint of the hypermultiplet low-energy effective action given by the
N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model with the Eguchi-Hanson (ALE) target
space.
