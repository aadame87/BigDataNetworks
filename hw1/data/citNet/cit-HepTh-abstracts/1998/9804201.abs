  In SO(32) heterotic string theory, the space-time at the core of N coincident
NS-fivebranes is an infinite throat, R x S^3. As shown by Witten, the throat
signals a singularity in the usual heterotic string conformal field theory and
a non--perturbative USp(2N) gauge group appears, due to the N small instantons
at the fivebranes' core. Nevertheless, we look for some trace of the
non-perturbative physics in a description of the heterotic string infinitely
far down the throat. Our guide is a D1-brane probing N D5-branes in type I,
which yields a 1+1 dimensional (0,4) supersymmetric model with ADHM data in its
couplings, as shown by Douglas. The neighbourhood of the classical boundary of
the hypermultiplet moduli space of the theory flows to an exact conformal field
theory description of the throat theory. Ironically, the remnant of the
non-perturbative symmetry is indeed found in the conformal field theory,
lurking in the structure of the partition function, and encoded in a family of
deformations of the theory along flat directions. The deformations have an
explicit description using the flow from the type I theory, and have a
hyperKahler structure. Similar results hold true for the analogous (4,4)
supersymmetric situation in the type IIB theory, as is evident in the work of
Diaconescu and Seiberg.
