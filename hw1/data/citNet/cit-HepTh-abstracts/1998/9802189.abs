  We analyze gauge symmetry enhancements $SO(16)\to E_8$ on eight D7-branes and
$SO(14)\times U(1)\to E_8$ on seven D7-branes from open strings. String
configurations which we present in this paper are closely related to the ones
given by Gaberdiel and Zwiebach. Our construction is based on $SO(8)\times
SO(8)$ decomposition and its relation to the D8-brane case via T-duality is
clearer. Then we study supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on D3-brane near the
D7-branes. This theory has flavour symmetry group which is equal to the gauge
group on D7-branes. We suggest that when this symmetry is enhanced, two dyons
make bound states which, together with elementary quarks, constitute an $E_8$
multiplet.
