  We investigate the non-perturbative equivalence of some heterotic/type II
dual pairs with N=2 supersymmetry. The perturbative heterotic scalar manifolds
are respectively SU(1, 1)/U(1) x SO(2, 2+NV)/ SO(2) x SO(2+NV) and SO(4, 4+NH)/
SO(4) x SO(4+NH) for moduli in the vector multiplets and hypermultiplets. The
models under consideration correspond, on the type II side, to self-mirror
Calabi-Yau threefolds with Hodge numbers h(1,1)= NV +3= h(2,1)= NH +3, which
are K3 fibrations. We consider three classes of dual pairs, with NV=NH=8, 4 and
2. The models with h(1,1)=7 and 5 provide new constructions, while the
h(1,1)=11, already studied in the literature, is reconsidered here.
Perturbative R2-like corrections are computed on the heterotic side by using a
universal operator whose amplitude has no singularities in the (T,U) space, and
can therefore be compared with the type II side result. We point out several
properties connecting K3 fibrations and spontaneous breaking of the N=4
supersymmetry to N=2. As a consequence of the reduced S- and T- duality
symmetries, the instanton numbers in these three classes are restricted to
integers, which are multiples of 2, 2 and 4, for NV=8, 4 and 2, respectively.
