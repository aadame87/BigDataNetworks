  We study N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N) from the point of
view of the Whitham hierarchy. We develop a new recursive method to compute the
whole instanton expansion of the prepotential using the theta function
associated to the root lattice of the group. Explicit results for the one and
two-instanton corrections in SU(N) are presented. Interpreting the slow times
of the hierarchy as additional couplings, we show how they can be promoted to
spurion superfields that softly break N=2 supersymmetry down to N=0. This
provides a family of nonsupersymmetric deformations of the theory, associated
to higher Casimir operators of the gauge group. The SU(3) theory is analyzed in
some detail.
