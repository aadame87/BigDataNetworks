  We study the soft breaking of N=2 self-dual gauge theories down to N=0 by
promoting the coupling constant and hypermultiplet masses to spurions, and we
analyze the microscopic duality symmetry in the resulting models. Explicit
formulae are given for the Seiberg-Witten periods and couplings in the case of
SU(2), and we perform a numerical study of the non-supersymmetric vacuum
structure in the case of the mass-deformed N=4 SU(2) gauge theory. Although the
softly broken model has a well-defined behavior under the duality symmetry, the
stable vacua are in a confining phase. We also extend some of the results to
the self-dual theories with classical gauge groups, and we obtain the RG
equation for these models.
