  The quantum properties of charged black holes (BHs) in 2D dilaton-Maxwell
gravity (spontaneously compactified from heterotic string) with $N$ dilaton
coupled scalars are studied. We first investigate 2D BHs found by McGuigan,
Nappi and Yost. Kaluza-Klein reduction of 3D gravity with minimal scalars leads
also to 2D dilaton-Maxwell gravity with dilaton coupled scalars and the
rotating BH solution found by Ba\~nados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) which can
be also described by 2D charged dilatonic BH. Evaluating the one-loop effective
action for dilaton coupled scalars in large $N$ (and s-wave approximation for
BTZ case), we show that quantum-corrected BHs may evaporate or else
anti-evaporate similarly to 4D Nariai BH as is observed by Bousso and Hawking.
Higher modes may cause the disintegration of BH in accordance with recent
observation by Bousso.
