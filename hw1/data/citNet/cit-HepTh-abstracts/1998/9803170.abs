  We consider the dimensional reduction of N = 1 SYM_{2+1} to 1+1 dimensions,
which has (1,1) supersymmetry. The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N),
where N is a finite variable. We implement Discrete Light-Cone Quantization to
determine non-perturbatively the bound states in this theory. A careful
analysis of the spectrum is performed at various values of N, including the
case where N is large (but finite), allowing a precise measurement of the 1/N
effects in the quantum theory. The low energy sector of the theory is shown to
be dominated by string-like states. The techniques developed here may be
applied to any two dimensional field theory with or without supersymmetry.
