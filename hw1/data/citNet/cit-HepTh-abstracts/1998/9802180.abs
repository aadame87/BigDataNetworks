  We review the Coulomb gauge in QCD and report some recent results. The
minimal Coulomb gauge is defined and the fundamental modular region, a region
without Gribov copies, is described. The Coulomb gauge action is expressed in
terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom with an instantaneous Coulomb
interaction, and its physical meaning is discussed. The local Coulomb gauge
action with phase-space and ghost variables is derived, and its BRS-invariance
and renormalizability are reviewed. It is shown that the instantanteous part
$V(R)$ of $g^2 D_{00}(R, t)$, the time-time component of the gluon propagator,
is a renormalization-group invariant $V(R) = f(R\Lambda_{QCD})/R$, and that the
contribution of $V(R)$ to the Wilson loop exponentiates. It is conjectured that
$V(R) \sim \kappa_{coul}R$ at large $R$, and that $\kappa_{coul}$ provides an
order parameter for confinement of color even in the presence of dynamical
quarks.
