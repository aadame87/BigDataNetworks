  We construct a new gauge theory on a pair of d-dimensional noncommutative
tori. The latter comes from an intimate relationship between the noncommutative
geometry associated with a lattice vertex operator algebra A and the
noncommutative torus. We show that the (truncated) tachyon subalgebra of A is
naturally isomorphic to a class of twisted modules representing quantum
deformations of the algebra of functions on the torus. We construct the
corresponding even real spectral triples and determine their Morita equivalence
classes using string duality arguments. These constructions yield simple proofs
of the O(d,d;Z) Morita equivalences between $d$-dimensional noncommutative tori
and give a natural physical interpretation of them in terms of the target space
duality group of toroidally compactified string theory. We classify the
automorphisms of the twisted modules and construct the most general gauge
theory which is invariant under the automorphism group. We compute bosonic and
fermionic actions associated with these gauge theories and show that they are
explicitly duality-symmetric. The duality-invariant gauge theory is manifestly
covariant but contains highly non-local interactions. We show that it also
admits a new sort of particle-antiparticle duality which enables the
construction of instanton field configurations in any dimension. The duality
non-symmetric on-shell projection of the field theory is shown to coincide with
the standard non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theory minimally coupled to massive
Dirac fermion fields.
