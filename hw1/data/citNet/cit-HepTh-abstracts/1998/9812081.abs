  We study a three-dimensional gauge theory obtained from the dimensional
reduction of a D4-brane worldvolume theory in the background of space-time
moduli. An SL(3) symmetry in this theory, which acts on fields as well as
coupling constants, is identified. By comparing the energies with the string
tensions, we show that certain 1/2 supersymmetric classical solutions of this
theory can be identified as SL(3,Z) multiplets of type II strings in eight
dimensions. Results are then generalized to the non-linear Born-Infeld action.
We also discuss the possibility of 1/8 BPS states in this theory and their
representations in terms of string networks.
