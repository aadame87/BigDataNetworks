  In this work, we consider matroid theory. After presenting three different
(but equivalent) definitions of matroids, we mention some of the most important
theorems of such theory. In particular, we note that every matroid has a dual
matroid and that a matroid is regular if and only if it is binary and includes
no Fano matroid or its dual. We show a connection between this last theorem and
octonions which at the same time, as it is known, are related to the Englert's
solution of D = 11 supergravity. Specifically, we find a relation between the
dual of Fano matroid and D = 11 supergravity. Possible applications to M-theory
are speculated upon.
