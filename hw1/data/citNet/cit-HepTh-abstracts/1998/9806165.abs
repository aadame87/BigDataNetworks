  We examine in non-Abelian gauge theory the heavy quark limit in the presence
of the (anti-)self-dual homogeneous background field and see that a confining
potential emerges, consistent with the Wilson criterion, although the potential
is quadratic and not linear in the quark separation. This builds upon the
well-known feature that propagators in such a background field are entire
functions. The way in which deconfinement can occur at finite temperature is
then studied in the static temporal gauge by calculation of the effective
potential at high temperature. Finally we discuss the problems to be surmounted
in setting up the calculation of the effective potential nonperturbatively on
the lattice.
