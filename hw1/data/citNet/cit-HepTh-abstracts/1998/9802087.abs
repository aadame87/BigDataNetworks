Title: Adiabatic Vacuumstates of the Dirac-field on a Curved Spacetime
Authors: Mark Wellmann

  In this article we review the quantization of the Dirac-field on a curved
spacetime. For that purpose we describe the construction of the local
observable algebras in the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. Among
the possible states we single out the so called Hadamard-states, which are the
ones relevant for physics. Finally, as an example, we give a definition for an
adiabatic vacuum state of the Dirac-field on a Robertson-Walker spacetime. We
believe that these states are physical in the sense that they have the
singularity structure of Hadamard-form, although we cannot give a formal proof
of this conjecture.
