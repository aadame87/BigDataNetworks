  Keeping N=1 supersymmetry in 4-dimension and in the leading order, we disuss
the various orbifold compactifications of M-theory suggested by Horava and
Witten on $T^6/Z_3$, $T^6/Z_6$, $T^6/Z_{12}$, and the compactification by
keeping singlets under $SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry, then the compactification
on $S^1/Z_2$. We also discuss the next to leading order K\"ahler potential,
superpotential, and gauge kinetic function in the $Z_{12}$ case. In addition,
we calculate the SUSY breaking soft terms and find out that the universality of
the scalar masses will be violated, but the violation might be very small.
