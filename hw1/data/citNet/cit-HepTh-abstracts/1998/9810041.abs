Title: On Gauged Maximal Supergravity In Six Dimensions
Authors: P.M.Cowdall (Cambridge University)
Comments: 26 pages, LaTeX, no figures. Significant simplifications of final
  results have been made. Also an appendix concerning the limit of D=5 N=4
  SU(2)xU(1) gauged supergravity, in which the U(1) coupling constant is turned
  off, has been added. Minor typos have been corrected. Complete bosonic and
  fermionic Lagrangians and susy transformation laws have been added as
  appendices

  The maximal SO(5) gauged D=7 supergravity is dimensionally reduced to six
dimensions yielding a new SO(5) gauged D=6 model. It is shown that, unlike in
D=7, the SO(5) gauge coupling constant can be taken to zero to yield the
maximally extended supergravity in six dimensions. It is also shown that the
limit of D=5 N=4 SU(2)xU(1) gauged supergravity in which the U(1) coupling
constant is turned off can be obtained.
