  Topological defects can arise in symmetry breaking models where the scalar
field potential $V(\phi)$ has no minima and is a monotonically decreasing
function of $|\phi|$. The properties of such vacuumless defects are quite
different from those of the ``usual'' strings and monopoles. In some models
such defects can serve as seeds for structure formation, or produce an
appreciable density of mini-black holes.
