  The Topological N=2 Superconformal algebra has 29 different types of singular
vectors (in complete Verma modules) distinguished by the relative U(1) charge
and the BRST-invariance properties of the vector and of the primary on which it
is built. Whereas one of these types only exists at level zero, the remaining
28 types exist for general levels and can be constructed already at level 1. In
this paper we write down one-to-one mappings between 16 of these types of
topological singular vectors and the singular vectors of the Antiperiodic NS
algebra. As a result one obtains construction formulae for these 16 types of
topological singular vectors using the construction formulae for the NS
singular vectors due to Doerrzapf.
