  We compute the quark--antiquark potential in three dimensional massive
Quantum Electrodynamics for arbitrary fermion mass. The result indicates that
screening prevails for any quark masses, contrary to the classical
expectations, generalizing our previous result obtained for large masses. We
also test the validity of several approximation schemes using a detailed
numerical analysis. The classical result is still reproduced for small
separation of the quarks.
