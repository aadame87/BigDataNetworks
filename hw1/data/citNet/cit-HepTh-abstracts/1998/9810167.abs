  We give another derivation of quark confinement in QCD from the viewpoint of
the low-energy effective Abelian gauge theory of QCD obtained via Abelian
projection. It is based on the recently discovered
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the four-dimensional
Abelian gauge theory. Moreover, we show that there exists a critical gauge
coupling constant in QCD, above which confinement set in and below which there
is no confinement. In a SU(N) gauge theory with $N_f$ flavored fermions, we
argue that this leads to a critical value of fermion flavors $N_f^c$ for the
confinement as well as the chiral symmetry breaking, which separates the
deconfinement and chiral symmetric phase. A finite-temperature deconfinement
transition is also discussed briefly.
