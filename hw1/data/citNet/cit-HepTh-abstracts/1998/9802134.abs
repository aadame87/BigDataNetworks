  A contour gauge of general type is analysed where 1-form (vector potential)
is expressed as a contour integral of the 2-form (field strength) along an
arbitrary contour $C$. For a special class of contours the gauge condition
reduces to $k_{\mu}(x) A_{\mu}(x) = 0 $ where $k_{\mu}(x)$ is a tangent vector
to the contour $C$. A simple proof of the nonabelian Stokes theorem is given
demonstrating the advantage of the gauge.
