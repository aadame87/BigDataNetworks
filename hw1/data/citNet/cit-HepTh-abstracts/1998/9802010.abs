  In this review we describe statistical mechanics of quantum systems in the
presence of a Killing horizon and compare statistical-mechanical and one-loop
contributions to black hole entropy. Studying these questions was motivated by
attempts to explain the entropy of black holes as a statistical-mechanical
entropy of quantum fields propagating near the black hole horizon. We provide
an introduction to this field of research and review its results. In
particular, we discuss the relation between the statistical-mechanical entropy
of quantum fields and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the standard scheme
with renormalization of gravitational coupling constants and in the theories of
induced gravity.
