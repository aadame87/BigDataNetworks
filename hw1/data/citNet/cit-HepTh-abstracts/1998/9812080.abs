  Hamiltonian light-front field theory can be used to solve for hadron states
in QCD. To this end, a method has been developed for systematic renormalization
of Hamiltonian light-front field theories, with the hope of applying the method
to QCD. It assumed massless particles, so its immediate application to QCD is
limited to gluon states or states where quark masses can be neglected. This
paper builds on the previous work by including particle masses
non-perturbatively, which is necessary for a full treatment of QCD. We show
that several subtle new issues are encountered when including masses
non-perturbatively. The method with masses is algebraically and conceptually
more difficult; however, we focus on how the methods differ. We demonstrate the
method using massive phi^3 theory in 5+1 dimensions, which has important
similarities to QCD.
