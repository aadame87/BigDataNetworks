  Is is shown that a nonhomogeneous diffusion in flat space with a tensor of
diffusion can be described as a homogeneous diffusion in a Riemannian manyfold
with this tensor of diffusion as a metric tensor. The curvature and the
gravitation are represented as manifestations of structure of stochastic
space-time, i.e. as consequences of quantum fluctuations. Einstein's equations
for metric tensor represented as equations for tensor of diffusion. The energy
density of such diffusional gravitation is negative defined and leads to
renormalizable quantum gravity with vanishing cosmological constant.
