  We consider the simplest geometrical particle model associated with
light-like curves in (2+1)-dimensions. The action is proportional to the
pseudo-arc length of the particle's path. We show that under quantization it
yields the (2+1)-dimensional anyonic field equation supplemented with a
Majorana-like relation on mass and spin, i.e., $mass \times spin =\alpha^2$,
with $\alpha$ the coupling constant in front of the action.
