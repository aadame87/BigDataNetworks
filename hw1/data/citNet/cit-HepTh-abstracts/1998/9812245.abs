\\
  The calculation of the interaction energy in pure QED and
Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory is re-examined by exploiting the path
dependence of the gauge-invariant variables formalism. In particular, we
consider a spacelike straight line which leads to the Poincar\'{e} gauge.
Subtleties related to the problem of exhibiting explicitly the interaction
energies are illustrated.
