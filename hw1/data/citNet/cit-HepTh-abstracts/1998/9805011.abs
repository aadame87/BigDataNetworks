  I discuss a formula decomposing the integral of time-ordered products of
operators into sums of products of integrals of time-ordered commutators. The
resulting factorization enables summation of an infinite series to be carried
out to yield an explicit formula for the time-ordered exponentials. The
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula and the nonabelian eikonal formula obtained
previously are both special cases of this result.
