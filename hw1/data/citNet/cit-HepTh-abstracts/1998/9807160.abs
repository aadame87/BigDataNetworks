  A non-linear integral equation (NLIE) governing the finite size effects of
excited states of even topological charge in the sine-Gordon (sG) / massive
Thirring (mTh) field theory, deducible from a light-cone lattice formulation of
the model, has been known for some time. In this letter we conjecture an
extension of this NLIE to states with odd topological charge, thus completing
the spectrum of the theory. The scaling functions obtained as solutions to our
conjectured NLIE are compared successfully with Truncated Conformal Space data
and the construction is shown to be compatible with all other facts known about
the local Hilbert spaces of sG and mTh models. With the present results we have
achieved a full control over the finite size behaviour of energy levels of
sG/mTh theory.
