  In this paper we investigate N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with a product
gauge group. By using smoothly confining dynamics, we can find new dualities
which include higher-rank tensor fields, and in which the dual gauge group is
simple, not a product. Some of them are dualities between chiral and non-chiral
gauge theories. We also discuss some applications to dynamical supersymmetry
breaking phenomena and new confining theories with a tree-level superpotential.
