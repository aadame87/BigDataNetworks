  We generalize the Maldacena correspondence to the logarithmic conformal field
theories. We study the correspondence between field theories in
(d+1)-dimensional AdS space and the d-dimensional logarithmic conformal field
theories in the boundary of $AdS_{d+1}$. Using this correspondence, we get the
n-point functions of the corresponding logarithmic conformal field theory in
d-dimensions.
