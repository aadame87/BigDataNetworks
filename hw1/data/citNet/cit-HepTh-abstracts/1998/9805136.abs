  Via supergravity, we argue that the infinite Lorentz boost along the M theory
circle a la Seiberg toward the DLCQ M theory compactified on a p-torus (p<5)
implies the holographic description of the microscopic theory. This argument
lets us identify the background geometries of DLCQ $M$ theory on a p-torus; for
p=0 (p=1), the background geometry turns out to be eleven-dimensional
(ten-dimensional) flat Minkowski space-time, respectively. Holography for these
cases results from the localization of the light-cone momentum. For p = 2,3,4,
the background geometries are the tensor products of an Anti de Sitter space
and a sphere, which, according to the AdS/CFT correspondence, have the
holographic conformal field theory description. These holographic descriptions
are compatible to the microscopic theory of Seiberg based on $\tilde{M}$ theory
on a spatial circle with the rescaled Planck length, giving an understanding of
the validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
