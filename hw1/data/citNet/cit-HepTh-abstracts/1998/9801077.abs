  Phenomenological evidence and analytic approximations to the QCD ground state
suggest a complex gluon condensate structure. Exclusion of elementary fermion
excitations by the generation of infinite mass corrections is a consequence. In
addition the existence of vacuum condensates in unbroken non-abelian gauge
theories, endows SU(3) and higher order groups with a non-trivial structure in
the manifold of possible vacuum solutions, which is not present in SU(2). This
may be related to the existence of particle generations.
