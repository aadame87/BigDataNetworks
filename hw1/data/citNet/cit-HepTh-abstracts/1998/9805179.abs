  We evaluate characters of irreducible representations of the N=2
supersymmetric extension of the Virasoro algebra. We do so by deriving the
BGG-resolution of the admissible N=2 representations and also a new
3,5,7...-resolution in terms of twisted massive Verma modules. We analyse how
the characters behave under the automorphisms of the algebra, whose most
significant part is the spectral flow transformations. The possibility to
express the characters in terms of theta functions is determined by their
behaviour under the spectral flow. We also derive the identity expressing every
$\hat{sl}(2)$ character as a linear combination of spectral-flow transformed
N=2 characters; this identity involves a finite number of N=2 characters in the
case of unitary representations. Conversely, we find an integral representation
for the admissible N=2 characters as contour integrals of admissible
$\hat{sl}(2)$ characters.
