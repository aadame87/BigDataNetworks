Title: Open Inflation, the Four Form and the Cosmological Constant
Author: Neil Turok and S.W. Hawking
Comments: 11 pages, RevTex file. Replaced version contains major corrections,
  including a crucial new surface term, and important additions. A connection
  to eleven dimensional supergravity is made. The anthropic solution of the
  cosmological constant problem now holds with a real four form in the
  Lorentzian region. The previously claimed solution to the empty universe
  problem is shown to be incorrect, but a new solution is suggested
Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B432 (1998) 271-278
\\
  Fundamental theories of quantum gravity such as supergravity include a four
form field strength which contributes to the cosmological constant. The
inclusion of such a field into our theory of open inflation (hep-th/9802030)
allows an anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem in which the
cosmological constant gives a small but non-negligible contribution to the
density of today's universe. We include a discussion of the role of the
singularity in our solution and a reply to Vilenkin's recent criticism
(hep-th/9803084).
