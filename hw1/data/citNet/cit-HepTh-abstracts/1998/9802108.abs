  We investigate the self-dual Yang-Mills gauge configurations on $R^3\times
S^1$ when the gauge symmetry SU(2) is broken to U(1) by the Wilson loop. We
construct the explicit field configuration for a single instanton by the Nahm
method and show that an instanton is composed of two self-dual monopoles of
opposite magnetic charge. We normalize the moduli space metric of an instanton
and study various limits of the field configuration and its moduli space
metric.
