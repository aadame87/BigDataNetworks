  It is well known that rational 2D conformal field theories are connected with
Chern-Simons theories defined on 3D real manifolds. We consider holomorphic
analogues of Chern-Simons theories defined on 3D complex manifolds (six real
dimensions) and describe 4D conformal field theories connected with them. All
these models are integrable. We describe analogues of the Virasoro and affine
Lie algebras, the local action of which on fields of holomorphic analogues of
Chern-Simons theories becomes nonlocal after pushing down to the action on
fields of integrable 4D conformal field theories. Quantization of integrable 4D
conformal field theories and relations to string theories are briefly
discussed.
