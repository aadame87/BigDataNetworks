  We give a new integrable boundary condition in affine Toda theory which is
soliton-preserving in the sense that a soliton hitting the boundary is
reflected as a soliton. All previously known integrable boundary conditions
forced a soliton to be converted into an antisoliton upon reflection. We prove
integrability of our boundary condition using a generalization of Sklyanin's
formalism.
