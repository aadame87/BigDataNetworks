  We verify the QED Ward identity for the two- and three -point functions at
non-equilibrium in the HTL limit. We use the Keldysh formalism of real time
finite temperature field theory. We obtain an identity of the same form as the
Ward identity for a set of one loop self-energy and one loop three-point vertex
diagrams which are constructed from HTL effective propagators and vertices.
