  A linear odd Poisson bracket (antibracket) realized solely in terms of
Grassmann variables is suggested. It is revealed that the bracket, which
corresponds to a semi-simple Lie group, has at once three Grassmann-odd
nilpotent $\Delta$-like differential operators of the first, the second and the
third orders with respect to Grassmann derivatives, in contrast with the
canonical odd Poisson bracket having the only Grassmann-odd nilpotent
differential $\Delta$-operator of the second order. It is shown that these
$\Delta$-like operators together with a Grassmann-odd nilpotent Casimir
function of this bracket form a finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra.
