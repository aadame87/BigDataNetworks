  We find exact D-brane configurations in the Nappi-Witten background using the
boundary state approach and describe how they are related by T-duality
transformations. We also show that the classical boundary conditions of the
associated sigma model correspond to a field dependent automorphism relating
the chiral currents and discuss the correspondence between the boundary state
approach and the sigma model approach.
