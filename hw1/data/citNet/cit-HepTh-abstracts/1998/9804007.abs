  S-dualities in scale invariant N=2 supersymmetric field theories with product
gauge groups are derived by embedding those theories in asymptotically free
theories with higher rank gauge groups. S-duality transformations on the
couplings of the scale invariant theory follow from the geometry of the
embedding of the scale invariant theory in the Coulomb branch of the
asymptotically free theory.
