  We study the M-theory five-brane wrapped around the Seiberg-Witten curves for
pure classical and exceptional groups given by an integrable system.
Generically, the D4-branes arise as cuts that collapse to points after
compactifying the eleventh dimension and going to the semiclassical limit,
producing brane configurations of NS5- and D4-branes with N=2 gauge theories on
the world volume of the four-branes. We study the symmetries of the different
curves to see how orientifold planes are related to the involutions needed to
obtain the distinguished Prym variety of the curve. This explains the
subtleties encountered for the Sp(2n) and SO(2n +1). Using this approach we
investigate the curves for exceptional groups, especially G_2 and E_6, and show
that unlike for classical groups taking the semiclassical ten dimensional limit
does not reduce the cuts to D4-branes. For G_2 we find a genus two quotient
curve that contains the Prym and has the right properties to describe the G_2
field theory, but the involutions are far more complicated than the ones for
classical groups. To realize them in M-theory instead of an orientifold plane
we would need another object, a kind of curved orientifold surface.
