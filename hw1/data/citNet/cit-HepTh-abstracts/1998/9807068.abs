  In this paper we describe a new type of topological defect, called a homilia
string, which is stabilized via interactions with the string network. Using
analytical and numerical techniques, we investigate the stability and dynamics
of homilia strings, and show that they can form stable electroweak strings. In
SU(2)xU(1) models of symmetry breaking the intersection of two homilia strings
is identified with a sphaleron. Due to repulsive forces, the homilia strings
seperate, resulting in sphaleron annihilation. It is shown that electroweak
homilia string loops cannot stabilize as vortons, which circumvents the adverse
cosmological problems associated with stable loops. The consequences for GUT
scale homilia strings are also discussed.
