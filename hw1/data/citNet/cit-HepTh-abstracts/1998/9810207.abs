\\
  A variant of the divergence theory for vacuum-condensation developed in a
previous communication is analyzed from the viewpoint of a 'time' asymmetric
law in vacuum. This law is found to establish a substantial distinction between
dynamically allowed vacuum-configurations related by signature changing duality
transformations.
