  We show that the Casimir, or zero-point, energy of a dilute dielectric ball,
or of a spherical bubble in a dielectric medium, coincides with the sum of the
van der Waals energies between the molecules that make up the medium. That
energy, which is finite and repulsive when self-energy and surface effects are
removed, may be unambiguously calculated by either dimensional continuation or
by zeta function regularization. This physical interpretation of the Casimir
energy seems unambiguous evidence that the bulk self-energy cannot be relevant
to sonoluminescence.
