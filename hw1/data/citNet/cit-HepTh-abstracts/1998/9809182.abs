  We recover a general representation for the quantum state of a relativistic
closed line (loop) in terms of string degrees of freedom.The general form of
the loop functional splits into the product of the Eguchi functional, encoding
the holographic quantum dynamics, times the Polyakov path integral, taking into
account the full Bulk dynamics, times a loop effective action, which is needed
to renormalize boundary ultraviolet divergences. The Polyakov string action is
derived as an effective actionfrom a phase space,covariant,Schild action, by
functionally integrating out the world-sheet coordinates.The area coordinates
description of the boundary quantum dynamics, is shown to be induced by the
``zero mode'' of the bulk quantum fluctuations. Finally, we briefly comment
about a ``unified, fully covariant'' description of points, loops and strings
in terms of Matrix Coordinates.
