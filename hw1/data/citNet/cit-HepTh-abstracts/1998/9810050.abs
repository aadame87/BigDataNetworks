  We consider the Matrix theory proposal describing eleven-dimensional
Schwarzschild black holes. We argue that the Newtonian potential between two
black holes receives a genuine long range quantum gravity correction, which is
finite and can be computed from the supergravity point of view. The result
agrees with Matrix theory up to a numerical factor which we have not computed.
