  It is argued that degrees of freedom responsible for the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy of a black hole in induced gravity are described by two dimensional
quantum field theory defined on the bifurcation surface of the horizon. This
result is proved for a class of induced gravity models with scalar, spinor and
vector heavy constituents.
