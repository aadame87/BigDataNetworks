  Using recently developed methods of character expansions we solve exactly in
the large N limit a new two-matrix model of hermitean matrices A and B with the
action S={1\over 2}(\tr A^2+\tr B^2)-{\alpha\over 4}(\tr A^4+\tr B^4)
-{\beta\over 2} \tr(AB)^2. This model can be mapped onto a special case of
the 8-vertex model on dynamical planar graphs. The solution is parametrized in
terms of elliptic functions. A phase transition is found: the critical point is
a conformal field theory with central charge c=1 coupled to 2D quantum gravity.
