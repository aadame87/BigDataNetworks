  A reformulation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of Callen and Welton
is presented in such a manner that the basic idea of Feynman-Vernon and
Caldeira -Leggett of using an infinite number of oscillators to simulate the
dissipative medium is realized manifestly without actually introducing
oscillators. If one assumes the existence of a well defined dissipative
coefficient $R(\omega)$ which little depends on the temperature in the energy
region we are interested in, the spontanous and induced emissions as well as
induced absorption of these effective oscillators with correct Bose
distribution automatically appears.
  Combined with a dispersion relation, we reproduce the tunneling formula in
the presence of dissipation at finite temperature without referring to an
explicit model Lagrangian. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem of Callen-Welton
is also generalized to the fermionic dissipation (or fluctuation) which allows
a transparent physical interpretation in terms of second quantized fermionic
oscillators. This fermionic version of fluctuation-dissipation theorem may
become relevant in the analyses of, for example, fermion radiation from a black
hole and also supersymmetry at the early universe.
