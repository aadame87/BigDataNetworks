  We consider three dimensional SU(N) N=1 super-Yang-Mills compactified on the
space-time R X S^1 X S^1. In particular, we compactify the light-cone
coordinate x^- on a light-like circle via DLCQ, and wrap the remaining
transverse coordinate on a spatial circle. By retaining only the first few
excited modes in the transverse direction, we are able to solve for bound state
wave functions and masses numerically by diagonalizing the discretized
light-cone supercharge. This regularization of the theory is shown to preserve
supersymmetry. We plot bound state masses as a function of the coupling,
showing the transition in particle masses as we move from a weakly to a
strongly-coupled theory. We analyze both numerically and analytically massless
states which exist only in the limit of strong or weak gauge coupling. In
addition, we find massless states that persist for all values of the gauge
coupling. An analytical treatment of these massless states is provided.
Interestingly, in the strong coupling limit, these massless states become
string-like.
