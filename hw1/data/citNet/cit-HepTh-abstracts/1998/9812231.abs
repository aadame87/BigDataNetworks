  It is shown that Connes' generalized gauge field in non-commutative geometry
is derived by simply requiring that Dirac lagrangian be invariant under local
transformations of the unitary elements of the algebra, which define the gauge
group. The spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry is guaranteed provided
the chiral fermions exist in more than one generations as first observed by
Connes-Lott. It is also pointed out that the most general gauge invariant
lagrangian in the bosonic sector has two more parameters than in the original
Connes-Lott scheme.
