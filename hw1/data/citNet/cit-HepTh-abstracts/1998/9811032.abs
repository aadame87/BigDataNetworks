  Non--minimal repulsive singularities (``repulsons'') in extended supergravity
theories are investigated. The short distance antigravity properties of the
repulsons are tested at the classical and the quantum level by a scalar
test--particle. Using a partial wave expansion it is shown that the particle
gets totally reflected at the origin. A high frequency incoming particle
undergoes a phase shift of $\frac{\pi}{2}$. However, the phase shift for a
low--frequency particle depends upon the physical data of the repulson. The
curvature singularity at a finite distance $r_h$ turns out to be transparent
for the scalar test--particle and the coordinate singularity at the origin
serves as a repulsive barrier at which particles bounce off.
