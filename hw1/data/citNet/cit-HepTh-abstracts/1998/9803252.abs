  The point where a D2-brane intersecting a stack of D2-branes is proposed as a
candidate for the 't Hooft vortex in the world-volume theory of N D2-branes.
This straightforwardly generalizes to D3-branes, where a vortex line is
generated by the intersection. Similarly, there are such objects on M-branes.
We use Maldacena's conjecture to compute the static potential between a vortex
and an anti-vortex in each case, in the large N limit.
