  We consider a subset of the terms in the effective potential describing
three-graviton interactions in Matrix theory and in classical
eleven-dimensional supergravity. In agreement with the results of Dine and
Rajaraman, we find that these terms vanish in Matrix theory. We show that the
absence of these terms is compatible with the classical supergravity theory
when the theory is compactified in a lightlike direction, resolving an apparent
discrepancy between the two theories. A brief discussion is given of how this
calculation might be generalized to compare the Matrix theory and supergravity
descriptions of an arbitrary 3-body system.
