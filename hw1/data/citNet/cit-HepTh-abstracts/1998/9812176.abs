  The O(n) nonlinear sigma model in 1+1 dimensions is examined as quantum
mechanics on an infinite-dimensional configuration space. Two metrics are
defined in this space. One of these metrics is the same as Feynman's distance,
but we show his conclusions concerning potential energy versus distance from
the classical vacuum are incorrect. The potential-energy functional is found to
have barriers; the configurations on these barriers are solitons of an
associated sigma model with an external source. The tunneling amplitude is
computed for the O(2) model and soliton condensation is shown to drive the
phase transition at a critical coupling. We find the tunneling paths in the
configuration space of the O(3) model and argue that these are responsible for
the mass gap at $\theta=0$. These tunneling paths have half-integer topological
charge, supporting the conjecture due to Affleck and Haldane that there is a
massless phase at $\theta=\pi$.
