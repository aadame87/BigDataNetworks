  We study the supersymmetric extension of the gauged $ O(3) $ sigma model in $
2+1 $ dimensions and find the supersymmetry algebra. We also discuss soliton
solutions in case the Maxwell term is replaced by the Born-Infeld term. We show
that by appropriate choice of the potential, the self-dual equations in the
Born-Infeld case coincide with those of the Maxwell's case.
