  The general solution of the antifield-independent Wess-Zumino consistency
condition is worked out for models involving exterior form gauge fields of
arbitrary degree. We consider both the free theory and theories with
Chapline-Manton couplings. Our approach relies on solving the full set of
descent equations by starting from the last element down ("bottom").
