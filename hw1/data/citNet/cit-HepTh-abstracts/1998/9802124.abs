  The normal mode spectra of multiskyrmions play a key role in their
quantisation. We present a general method capable of predicting all the
low-lying vibrational modes of known minimal energy multiskyrmions. In
particular, we explain the origin of the higher multipole breathing modes,
previously observed but not understood. We show how these modes may be
classified according to the symmetry group of the static solution. Our results
provide strong hints that the N-skyrmion moduli space, for N>3, may have a
richer structure than previously thought, incorporating 8N-4 degrees of
freedom.
