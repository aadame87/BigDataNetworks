  We study the regularized correlation functions of the light-like coordinate
operators in the reduction to zero dimensions of the matrix model describing
$D$-particles in four dimensions. We investigate in great detail the related
matrix model originally proposed and solved in the planar limit by J. Hoppe. It
also gives the solution of the problem of 3-coloring of planar graphs. We find
interesting strong/weak 't Hooft coupling dependence. The partition function of
the grand canonical ensemble turns out to be a tau-function of KP hierarchy. As
an illustration of the method we present a new derivation of the large-N and
double-scaling limits of the one-matrix model with cubic potential.
