  Higher derivative terms in the effective action of certain Yang-Mills
theories can be severely constrained by supersymmetry. We show that requiring
sixteen supersymmetries in quantum mechanical gauge theory determines the $v^6$
term in the effective action. Even the numerical coefficient of the $v^6$ term
is fixed in terms of lower derivative terms in the effective action.
