  In this paper we demonstrate that there exists a close relationship between
quasi-exactly solvable quantum models and two special classes of classical
dynamical systems. One of these systems can be considered a natural
generalization of the multi-particle Calogero-Moser model and the second one is
a classical matrix model.
