  I consider the classical Kac-Moody algebra and Virasoro algebra in
Chern-Simons theory with boundary within the Dirac's canonical method and
Noether procedure. It is shown that the usual (bulk) Gauss law constraint
becomes a second-class constraint because of the boundary effect. From this
fact, the Dirac bracket can be constructed explicitly without introducing
additional gauge conditions and the classical Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras
are obtained within the usual Dirac method. The equivalence to the symplectic
reduction method is presented and the connection to the Ba\~nados's work is
clarified. It is also considered the generalization to the
Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory where the diffeomorphism symmetry is broken by
the (three-dimensional) Yang-Mills term. In this case, the same Kac-Moody
algebras are obtained although the two theories are sharply different in the
canonical structures. The both models realize the holography principle
explicitly and the pure CS theory reveals the correspondence of the
Chern-Simons theory with boundary/conformal field theory, which is more
fundamental and generalizes the conjectured anti-de Sitter/conformal field
theory correspondence.
