  The "Hodge strings" construction of solutions to associativity equations is
proposed. From the topological string theory point of view this construction
formalizes the "integration over the position of the marked point" procedure
for computation of amplitudes. From the mathematical point of view the "Hodge
strings" construction is just a composition of elements of harmonic theory
(known among physicists as a $t$-part of $t-t^*$ equations) and the K.Saito
construction of flat coordinates (starting from flat connection with a spectral
parameter).
   We also show how elements of K.Saito theory of primitive form appear
naturally in the "Landau-Ginzburg" version of harmonic theory if we consider
the holomorphic pieces of germs of harmonic forms at the singularity.
