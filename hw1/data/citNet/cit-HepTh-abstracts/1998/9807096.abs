  In this lecture we give an elementary introduction to the natural realization
of non-perturbative N=2 quantum field theories as a low energy limit of 
classical string theory. We review a systematic construction of six, five, and
four dimensional gauge theories using geometrical data, which provides the
exact, non-perturbative solution via mirror symmetry. This construction has
lead to the exact solution of a large class of gravity free gauge theories,
including Super Yang Mills (SYM) theories as well as non-conventional quantum
field theories without a known Lagrangian description.
