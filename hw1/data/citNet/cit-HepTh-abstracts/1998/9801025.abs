Title: Quantum Fields near Black Holes
Authors: Andreas Wipf
Comments: 33 pages, Latex, 5 figures
Report-no: FSU-TPI-11/97
\\
  This review gives an introduction into problems, concepts and techniques when
quantizing matter fields near black holes. The first part focusses on quantum
fields in general curved space-times. The second part is devoted to a detailed
treatment of the Unruh effect in uniformly accelerated frames and the Hawking
radiation of black holes. Paricular emphasis is put on the induced energy
momentum tensor near black holes
