  The presence of chiral fermions in the physical Hilbert space implies
consistency conditions on the spectral action. These conditions are equivalent
to the absence of gauge and gravitational anomalies. Suggestions for the
fermionic part of the spectral action are made based on the supersymmetrisation
of the bosonic part.
