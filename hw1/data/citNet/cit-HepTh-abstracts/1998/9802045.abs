Title: Solvable Lie Algebras, BPS Black Holes and Supergravity Gaugings
Author: Pietro Fre'
Notes: LaTeX, 8 pages. Talk given at the TMR, EEC contract meeting Gauge
  Theory, Susy, Unification held in Neuchatel, September 1997

\\
  In this talk I review both accomplished results and work in progress on the
use of solvable Lie algebras as an intrinsic algebraic characterization of the
scalar field sector of M--theory low energy effective lagrangians. In
particular I review the application of these techniques in obtaining the most
general form of BPS black hole solutions.
