  We use variational methods to calculate quasilocal energy quantum
corrections. A comparison with the effective potential calculated at quadratic
order is made by means of gaussian wave functionals. The method is a particular
case of the effective action for composite operators used in quantum field
theory. In pure gravity the method is applied for the first time. Implications
on the foam-like scenario are discussed.
