  Observational diagnostics are constructed which reflect the underlying
topology of Planckian space-time, and are directly related to phenomena on much
larger scales. Specific predictions are made for the masses of elementary
particles, coupling constants, quark confinement, black hole states, and the
cosmological constant. In particular, a mass of 131.6 GeV is found for the
Higgs boson. The main presented result is a discrete spectral signature at
inverse integer multiples of the zero point frequency $\nu_0=857.3588$ MHz.
That is, each photon of frequency $\nu_0m$, for an integer $m$, is paired with
an otherwise identical photon $\nu_0/m$, produced by the vacuum, but not vice
versa. The reader interested in the latter result only, should proceed to
Section 6 after the Introduction.
