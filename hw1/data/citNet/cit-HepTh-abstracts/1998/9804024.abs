  In the light-cone Fock state expansion of gauge theories, the influence of
non-valence states may be significant in precision non-perturbative
calculations. In two-dimensional gauge theories, it is shown how these states
modify the behaviour of the light-cone wavefunction in significant ways
relative to endemic choices of variational ansatz. Similar effects in
four-dimensional gauge theories are briefly discussed.
