  Recently we have proposed a set of variables for describing the infrared
limit of four dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. here we extend these
variables to the general case of four dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. We
find that the SU(N) connection A decomposes according to irreducible
representations of SO(N-1) and the curvature two-form F is related to the
symplectic Kirillov two forms that characterize irreducible representations of
SU(N). We propose a general class of nonlinear chiral models that may describe
stable, soliton-like configurations with nontrivial topological numbers.
