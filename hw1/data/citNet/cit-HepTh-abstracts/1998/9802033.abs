  We argue that certain BPS states in the D3-brane probe realization of N=2
SU(2) Super-Yang-Mills theory correspond to multi-pronged strings connecting
the D3-brane to the background 7-branes. This provides a physical realization
of the decay of these states on the curve of marginal stability, and explains
their absence in the strong coupling regime.
