  We present a ``toy'' model for breaking supersymmetric gauge theories at the
effective Lagrangian level. We show that it is possible to achieve the
decoupling of gluinos and squarks, below a given supersymmetry breaking scale
m, in the fundamental theory for super QCD once a suitable choice of
supersymmetry breaking terms is made. A key feature of the model is the
description of the ordinary QCD degrees of freedom via the auxiliary fields of
the supersymmetric effective Lagrangian. Once the anomaly induced effective QCD
meson potential is deduced we also suggest a decoupling procedure, when a
flavored quark becomes massive, which mimics the one employed by Seiberg for
supersymmetric theories. It is seen that, after quark decoupling, the QCD
potential naturally converts to the one with one less flavor. Finally we
investigate the N_c and N_f dependence of the \eta^{\prime} mass.
