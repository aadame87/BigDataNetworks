  This note is a summary of the work reported in hep-th/9801073. We give a
brief discussion of the fine tuning problem in pre-big bang cosmology. We use
the flatness problem as our test case, and in addition to the exact numerical
limits on initial conditions, we highlight the differences between pre-big bang
and standard inflation. The main difference is that in pre-big bang the
universe must be smooth and flat in an exponentially large domain already at
the beginning of the dilaton-driven inflation.
