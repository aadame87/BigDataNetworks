  We show that the logarithmically rising static potential between
opposite-charged sources in two dimensions is screened by dynamical fields even
if the probe charges are fractional, in units of the charge of the dynamical
fields. The effect is due to quantum mechanics: the wave functions of the
screening charges are superpositions of two bumps localized both near the
opposite- and the same-charge sources, so that each of them gets exactly
screened.
