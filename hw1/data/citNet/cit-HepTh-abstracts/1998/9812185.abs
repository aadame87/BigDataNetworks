  The consistency condition of the Faddeev-Niemi ansatz for the gauge-fixed
massless SU(2) gauge field is discussed. The generality of the ansatz is
demonstrated by obtaining a sufficient condition for the existence of the
three-component field introduced by Faddeev and Niemi. It is also shown that
the consistency conditions determine this three-component field as a functional
of two arbitrary functions. The consistency conditions corresponding to the
Periwal ansatz for the SU(N) gauge field with N larger than 2 are also
obtained. It is shown that the gauge field obeying the Periwal ansatz must
satisfy extra (N-1)(N-2)/2 conditions.
