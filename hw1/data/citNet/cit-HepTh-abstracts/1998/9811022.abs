  We consider firstly simple D=4 superalgebra with six real tensorial central
charges $Z_{\mu\nu}$, and discuss its possible realizations in massive and
massless cases. Massless case is dynamically realized by generalized
Ferber-Shirafuji (FS) model with fundamental bosonic spinor coordinates. The
Lorentz invariance is not broken due to the realization of central charges
generators in terms of bosonic spinors. The model contains four fermionic
coordinates and possesses three kappa-symmetries thus providing the BPS
configuration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We show that
the physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmann variable)
of our model can be described by OSp(8|1) supertwistor. The relation with
recent superparticle model by Rudychev and Sezgin is pointed out. Finally we
propose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one real
fundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle with
composite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane model
with nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically.
