  We show that a class of four-dimensional rotating black holes allow
five-dimensional embeddings as black rotating strings. Their near-horizon
geometry factorizes locally as a product of the three-dimensional anti-deSitter
space-time and a two-dimensional sphere (AdS_3 x S^2), with angular momentum
encoded in the global space-time structure. Following the observation that the
isometries on the AdS_3 space induce a two-dimensional (super)conformal field
theory on the boundary, we reproduce the microscopic entropy with the correct
dependence on the black hole angular momentum.
