  It is shown that there is no chirally symmetric vacuum state in the {cal N}=1
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The values of the gluino condensate and the
vacuum energy density are found out through a direct instanton calculation. A
qualitative picture of domain wall properties is presented, and a new
explanation of the phenomenon of strings ending on the wall is proposed.
