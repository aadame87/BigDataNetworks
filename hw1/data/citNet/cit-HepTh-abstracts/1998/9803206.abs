Title: Wrapping Branes in Space and Time
Authors: G W Gibbons
Comments: Latex, 12 pages, no figures
\\
  Branes may be approximated semi-classically by solutions of supergravity
theories with event and Cauchy horizons. I suggest that if one wishes to avoid
singularities and to capture accurately some of the properties of branes then
these classical spacetimes must be identified so as to render them periodic in
time.
