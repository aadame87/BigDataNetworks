Title: The action of outer automorphisms on bundles of chiral blocks
Authors: J. Fuchs, C. Schweigert
Comments: 46 pages, LaTeX2e. Final version (Commun.Math.Phys., in press). We
  have implemented the fact that the group of automorphisms in general acts
  only projectively on the chiral blocks and corrected some typos

  On the bundles of WZW chiral blocks over the moduli space of a punctured
rational curve we construct isomorphisms that implement the action of outer
automorphisms of the underlying affine Lie algebra. These bundle-isomorphisms
respect the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection and have finite order. When all
primary fields are fixed points, the isomorphisms are endomorphisms; in this
case, the bundle of chiral blocks is typically a reducible vector bundle. A
conjecture for the trace of such endomorphisms is presented; the proposed
relation generalizes the Verlinde formula. Our results have applications to
conformal field theories based on non-simply connected groups and to the
classification of boundary conditions in such theories.
