  We show that the four derivative terms in the effective action of
three-dimensional N=8 Yang-Mills theory are determined by supersymmetry. These
terms receive both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. Using our
technique for constraining the effective action, we are able to determine the
exact form of the eight fermion terms in the supersymmetric completion of the
$F^4$ term, including all instanton corrections. As a consequence, we argue
that the integral of the Euler density over $k$ monopole moduli space in SU(2)
Yang-Mills is determined by our non-renormalization theorem for all values of
$k$.
