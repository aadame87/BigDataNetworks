  We consider classical and quantum strings in the conformally invariant
background corresponding to the SL(2,R) WZWN model. This background is locally
anti-de Sitter spacetime with non-vanishing torsion. Conformal invariance is
expressed as the torsion being parallelized. The precise effect of the
conformal invariance on the dynamics of both circular and generic classical
strings is extracted. In particular, the conformal invariance gives rise to a
repulsive interaction of the string with the background which precisely cancels
the dominant attractive term arising from gravity. We perform both
semi-classical and canonical string-quantization, in order to see the effect of
the conformal invariance of the background on the string mass spectrum. Both
approaches yield that the high-mass states are governed by m sim HN (N,`large
integer'), where m is the string mass and H is the Hubble constant. It follows
that the level spacing grows proportionally to N: d(m^2 alpha')/dN sim N, while
the entropy goes like: S sim sqrt{m}. Moreover, it follows that there is no
Hagedorn temperature,so that the partition function is well defined at any
positive temperature. All results are compared with the analogue results in
Anti- de Sitter spacetime, which is a non conformal invariant background.
Conformal invariance simplifies the mathematics of the problem but the physics
remains mainly unchanged. Differences between conformal and non-conformal
backgrounds only appear in the intermediate region of the string spectrum, but
these differences are minor. For low and high masses, the string mass spectra
in conformal and non-conformal backgrounds are identical. Interestingly enough,
conformal invariance fixes the value of the spacetime curvature to be
-69/(26 alpha').
