Title: On Universality in Black Hole Thermodynamics

  The low energy decay rates of four- and five dimensional dyonic black holes
in string theory are equivalently described in terms of an effective near
horizon AdS_3 (BTZ) black hole. It is then argued that AdS_3 gravity provides
an universal microscopic description of the low energy dynamics these black
holes.
