  We compute the quark-monopole potential for ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in
the large $N$ limit. We find an attractive potential that falls off as 1/L and
is manifestly invariant under $g\to 1/g$. The strength of the potential is less
than the quark-antiquark and monopole-antimonopole potentials.
