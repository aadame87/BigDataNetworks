  In the light of $\phi $--mapping method and topological current theory, the
topological structure of the vortex state in TDGL model and the topological
quantization of the vortex topological charges are investigated. It is pointed
out that the topological charges of the vortices in TDGL model are described by
the Winding numbers of $\phi $--mapping which are determined in terms of the
Hopf indices and the Brouwer degrees of $\phi $--mapping.
