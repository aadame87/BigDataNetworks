  In a space of arbitrary dimensions, the effect of an external magnetic field
on the vacuum of a quantized charged scalar field is studied for the field
configuration in the form of a singular vortex. The zeta-function technique is
used to regularize ultraviolet divergences. The expression for the effective
action is derived. It is shown that the energy density and current induced in
the vacuum decrease exponentially at large distances from the vortex. The
analytic properties of vacuum features as functions of the complex-valued space
dimension are discussed.
