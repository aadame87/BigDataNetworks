Title: Tachyon Condensation on the Brane Antibrane System
Author: Ashoke Sen
Comments: LaTeX file, 6 pages, few lines have been added explaining why SO(32)
  spinor states in type I theory correspond to tachyonic kink solution on
  D-string anti-D-string pair

\\
  A coincident D-brane - anti-D-brane pair has a tachyonic mode. We present an
argument showing that at the classical minimum of the tachyonic potential the
negative energy density associated with the potential exactly cancels the sum
of the tension of the brane and the anti-brane, thereby giving a configuration
of zero energy density and restoring space-time supersymmetry.
