Title: Harmonic Superspaces For Three-Dimensional Theories
Authors: B.M. Zupnik
Comments: This work is based on the talk given at the International Seminar
  "Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries" dedicated to the memory of Prof.
  V.I. Ogievetsky (Dubna, July 22-26, 1997). Latex file, 8 pages
\\
  Three-dimensional field theories with N=3 and N=4 supersymmetries are
considered in the framework of the harmonic-superspace approach. Analytic
superspaces of these supersymmetries are similar; however, the geometry of
gauge theories with the manifest N=3 is richer and admits construction of the
topological mass term.
