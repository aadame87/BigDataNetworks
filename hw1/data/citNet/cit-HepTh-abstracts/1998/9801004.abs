  Through more detailed calculations on QED$_{1+1}$ and QED$_{3+1}$ emplying a
new treatment of Feynman Amplitudes, we attribute the regularization
independent and hence definite origin of chiral anomaly in perturbation theory
to an unambiguous term which is a rational function in momentum space. Some
relevant remarks are presented.
