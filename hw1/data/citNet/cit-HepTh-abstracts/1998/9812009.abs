  We study the scattering theory for the Gross-Neveu model on the half-line. We
find the reflection matrices for the elementary fermions, and by fusion we
compute the ones for the two-particle bound-states, showing that they satisfy
non-trivial bootstrap consistency conditions. We also compute more general
reflection matrices for the Gross-Neveu model and the nonlinear sigma model,
and argue that they correspond to the integrable boundary conditions we
identified in our previous paper hep-th/9809178.
