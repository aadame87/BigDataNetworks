  We expand on an idea of Seiberg that an N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory shows
confinement without breaking of chiral symmetry when the gauge symmetry of its
magnetic dual is completely broken by the Higgs effect. This has recently been
applied to some models involving tensor fields and an appropriate tree-level
superpotential. We show how the confining spectrum of a supersymmetric gauge
theory can easily be derived when a magnetic dual is known and we determine it
explicitly for many models containing fields in second rank tensor
representations. We also give the form of the confining superpotential for most
of these models.
