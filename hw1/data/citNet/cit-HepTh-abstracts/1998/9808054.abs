  In view of the presence of a superpotential, the dual of a gauge theory like
SQCD contains two coupling parameters. The method of the Reduction of Couplings
is used in order to express the parameter of the superpotential in terms of the
dual gauge coupling. In the conformal window and above it, a unique, isolated
solution is obtained. The coupling parameter of the superpotential is given
simply by f times the square of the gauge coupling. Here f is a function of the
the number of colors and the number of flavors, and it is known explicitly. The
solution is valid to all orders in the asymptotic expansion, and it is the
appropriate choice for the dual theory. The same solution exists in the free
magnetic interval. A `general' solution with non-integer powers is discussed,
as are some exceptional cases.
