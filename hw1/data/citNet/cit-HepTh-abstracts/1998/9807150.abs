  We consider some long multiplets describing bulk massive excitations of
M-theory two-branes and IIB string three-branes which correspond to ``non
chiral'' primary operators of the boundary OSp(8/4) and SU(2,2/4)
superconformal field theories. Examples of such multiplets are the ``radial''
modes on the branes, including up to spin 4 excitations, which may be then
considered as prototypes of states which are not described by the K-K spectrum
of the corresponding supergravity theories on AdS_4 x S_7 and AdS_5 x S_5
respectively.
