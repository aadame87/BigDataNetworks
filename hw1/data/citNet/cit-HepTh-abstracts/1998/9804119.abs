  We consider the GUT-like model with two scalar fields which has infinitesimal
deviation from the conformal invariant fixed point at high energy region. In
this case the dominating quantum effect is the conformal trace anomaly and the
interaction between the anomaly-generated propagating conformal factor of the
metric and the usual dimensional scalar field. This interaction leads to the
renormalization group flow from the conformal point. In the supersymmetric
conformal invariant model such an effect produces a very weak violation of
sypersymmetry at lower energies.
