\\
  A unified description of spacetime and matter at the Planck scale is proposed
by using the irreducible representation of N=10 extended Super-Poincar\'e
algebra, where all matters and all forces except the graviton are the
supersymmetric composites made of the fundamental objects with spin 1/2, 
superon quintet. All the local gauge interactions in GUTs are investigated
systematically by using the superon diagrams. The proton is stable and the
flavor changing neutral current process is suppressed in the superon pictures
of GUTs. The fundamental action of the superon model is proposed. The
characteristic predictions which can be tested in the (coming) high energy
experiments are discussed briefly.
