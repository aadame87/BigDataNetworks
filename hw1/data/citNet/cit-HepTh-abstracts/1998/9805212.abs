  We investigate the NBI matrix model with the potential
$X\Lambda+X^{-1}+(2\eta+1)\log X$ recently proposed to describe IIB
superstrings. With the proper normalization, using Virasoro constraints, we
prove the equivalence of this model and the Kontsevich matrix model for
$\eta\ne0$ and find the explicit transformation between the two models.
