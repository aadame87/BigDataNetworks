Title: Higgs Mechanism in Nontrivial Background
Author: V.I.Shevchenko
Comments: RevTeX, 6 pages, no figures, revised version
\\
  The modification of classical dynamics of abelian confining theory by virtue
of quantum Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen strings is discussed taking D=4 abelian
Higgs model as an example. The form of string corrections to the Wilson loop
correlators, gauge boson propagator, effective potential is presented and
possible relations to abelian projected QCD are outlined.
