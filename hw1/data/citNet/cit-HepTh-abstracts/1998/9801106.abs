Title: Wormholes on The World Volume
Authors: G. W. Gibbons
Comments: 11 pages Latex, no figures. This is the written version of a lecture
  given at "Quantum Mechanics of Fundamental Systems VI ", Santiago, Chile,
  August 1997 to appear in the Proceedings edited by C. Teitelboim and J.
  Zanelli
\\
  I describe some recent work in which classical solutions of Dirac-Born-Infeld
theory may be used to throw light on some properties of M-theory. The sources
of Born-Infeld theory are the ends of strings ending on the world volume.
Equivalently the fundamental string may be regarded as merely a thin and
extended piece of the world volume.
