  In the light of $\phi$-mapping method and topological current theory, the
topological structure and the topological quantization of arbitrary dimensional
topological defects are obtained under the condition that the Jacobian
$J(\phi/v) \neq 0$. When $J(\phi/v)=0$, it is shown that there exist the
crucial case of branch process. Based on the implicit function theorem and the
Taylor expansion, we detail the bifurcation of generalized topological current
and find different directions of the bifurcation. The arbitrary dimensional
topological defects are found splitting or merging at the degenerate point of
field function $\vec \phi$ but the total charge of the topological defects is
still unchanged.
