  We discuss supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory dimensionally reduced to zero
dimensions and evaluate the SU(2) and SU(3) partition functions by Monte Carlo
methods. The exactly known SU(2) results are reproduced to very high precision.
Our calculations for SU(3) agree closely with an extension of a conjecture due
to Green and Gutperle concerning the exact value of the SU(N) partition
functions.
