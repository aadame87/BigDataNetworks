  We show that contrary to the claim made by Hallin and Liljenberg in Phys.
Rev. D52 1150,(1995), (hep-th/9412188) the thermal correction to
the thermal decay or pair production rate for a system placed in a heat bath in
the presence of an external electric field, is always nonzero in the finite as
well as infinite time limit. Using the formalism outlined there, we reestimate
the decay rate for different values of temperature, mass and time.We also try
to identify the parameter ranges where the quantity of interest agrees with
that computed previously, at high temperature (in the infinite time limit),
from the imaginary part of the effective action using imaginary time and real
time formalism of thermal field theory. We also point out that in the strictly
infinite time limit, the correct decay rate as obtained from the work of Hallin
et. al. tends to diverge.
