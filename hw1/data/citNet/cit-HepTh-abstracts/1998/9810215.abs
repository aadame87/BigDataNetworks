  The set of space-time short-distance structures which can be described
through linear operators is limited to a few basic cases. These are continua,
lattices and a further short-distance structure which implies an ultraviolet
cut-off. Under certain conditions, these cut-off degrees of freedom can
reappear as internal degrees of freedom. We review the current status of the
classification and present new conjectures.
