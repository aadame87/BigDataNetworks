  We point out some problems with the previously-proposed phase diagram of the
$Z_6$ spin models. Consideration of the diagram near to the decoupling surface
using both exact and approximate arguments suggests a modification which
remedies these deficiencies. With the aid of a new parametrisation of the phase
space, we study the models numerically, with results which support our
conjectures.
