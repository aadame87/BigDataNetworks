  We describe in superspace a classical theory of two dimensional $(1,1)$
cosmological dilaton supergravity coupled to a massive superparticle. We give
an exact non-trivial superspace solution for the compensator superfield that
describes the supergravity, and then use this solution to construct a model of
a two-dimensional supersymmetric black hole.
