  We study large N SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in three and four dimensions using a
one-parameter family of supergravity models which originate from non-extremal
rotating D-branes. We show explicitly that varying this "angular momentum"
parameter decouples the Kaluza-Klein modes associated with the compact D-brane
coordinate, while the mass ratios for ordinary glueballs are quite stable
against this variation, and are in good agreement with the latest lattice
results. We also compute the topological susceptibility and the gluon
condensate as a function of the "angular momentum" parameter.
