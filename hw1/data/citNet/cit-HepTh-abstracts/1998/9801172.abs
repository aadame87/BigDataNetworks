  Here is presented a detailed work on the (1+1) dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory with static sources. By studying the structure of the SU(N) group and of
the Gauss' law we construct in the electric representation the appropriate wave
functionals, which are simultaneously eigenstates of the Gauss' operator and of
the Hamiltonian. The Fourier transformation between the A- and the
E-representations connecting the Wilson line and a superposition of our
solutions is given.
