  We consider N=1 two-dimensional (2d) dilatonic supergravity (SG), 2d
dilatonic SG obtained by dimensional reduction from N=1 four-dimensional (4d)
SG, N=2 2d dilatonic SG and string-inspired 4d dilatonic SG. For all the
theories, the corresponding action on a bosonic background is constructed and
the interaction with $N$ (dilatonic) Wess-Zumino (WZ) multiplets is presented.
Working in the large-N approximation, it is enough to consider the trace
anomaly induced effective action due to dilaton-coupled conformal matter as a
quantum correction (for 2d models s-waves approximation is additionally used).
The equations of motion for all such models with quantum corrections are
written in a form convenient for numerical analysis. Their solutions are
numerically investigated for 2d and 4d Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) or 4d
Kantowski-Sacks Universes with a time-dependent dilaton via exponential dilaton
coupling. The evolution of the corresponding quantum cosmological models is
given for different choices of initial conditions and theory parameters. In
most cases we find quantum singular Universes. Nevertheless, there are examples
of Universe non-singular at early times. Hence, it looks unlikely that quantum
matter back reaction on dilatonic background (at least in large $N$
approximation) may really help to solve the singularity problem.
