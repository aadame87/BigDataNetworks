  We give a simple and elegant proof of the Equivalence Theorem, stating that
two field theories related by nonlinear field transformations have the same S
matrix. We are thus able to identify a subclass of nonrenormalizable field
theories which are actually physically equivalent to renormalizable ones. Our
strategy is to show by means of the BRS formalism that the "nonrenormalizable"
part of such fake nonrenormalizable theories, is a kind of gauge fixing, being
confined in the cohomologically trivial sector of the theory.
