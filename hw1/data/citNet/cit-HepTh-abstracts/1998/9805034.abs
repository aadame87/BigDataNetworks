  It was shown by Connes, Douglas, Schwarz[1] that one can compactify M(atrix)
theory on noncommutative torus. We prove that compactifications on Morita
equivalent tori are physically equivalent. This statement can be considered as
a generalization of non-classical duality conjectured in [1] for
two-dimensional tori.
