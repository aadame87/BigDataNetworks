  We study the dilaton-dependence of the effective action for N=1, SU(N1) x
SU(N2) models with one generation of vectorlike matter transforming in the
fundamental of both groups. We treat in detail the confining and Coulomb phases
of these models writing explicit expressions in many cases for the effective
superpotential. We can do so for the Wilson superpotentials of the Coulomb
phase when N2=2, N1=2,4.
  In these cases the Coulomb phase involves a single U(1) gauge multiplet, for
which we exhibit the gauge coupling in terms of the modulus of an elliptic
curve. The SU(4) x SU(2) model reproduces the weak-coupling limits in a
nontrivial way. In the confining phase of all of these models, the dilaton
superpotential has a runaway form, but in the Coulomb phase the dilaton enjoys
flat directions. Had we used the standard moduli-space variables: Tr M^k,
k=1,..., N2, with M the quark condensate matrix, to parameterize the flat
directions instead of the eigenvalues of M, we would find physically
unacceptable behaviour, illustrating the importance to correctly identify the
moduli.
