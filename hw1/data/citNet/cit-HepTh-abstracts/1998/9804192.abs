  The dependence of the energies of axially symmetric monopoles of magnetic
charges 2 and 3, on the Higgs self-interaction coupling constant, is studied
numerically. Comparing the energy per unit topological charge of the charge-2
monopole with the energy of the spherically symmetric charge-1 monopole, we
confirm that there is only a repulsive phase in the interaction energy between
like monopoles
