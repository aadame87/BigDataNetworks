  We continue to explore the possibility that the graviton in two dimensions is
related to a quadratic differential that appears in the anomalous contribution
of the gravitational effective action for chiral fermions. A higher dimensional
analogue of this field might exist as well. We improve the defining action for
this diffeomorphism tensor field and establish a principle for how it interacts
with other fields and with point particles in any dimension. All interactions
are related to the action of the diffeomorphism group. We discuss possible
interpretations of this field.
