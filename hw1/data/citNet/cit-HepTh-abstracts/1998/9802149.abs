Title: A New Variant of the Casimir Effect and Its Exact Evaluation
Authors: Oded Kenneth and Shmuel Nussinov
Comments: 10 pages, latex, one figure
\\
  A new version of the Casimir effect where the two plates conduct in specific,
different, directions is considered. By direct functional integration the
evaluation of the Casimir energy as a function of the angle between the
conduction directions is reduced to quadratures. Other applications of the
method and a magnetic Casimir variant are mentioned.
