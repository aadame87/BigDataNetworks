  We study noncompact and static membrane solutions in Matrix theory. Demanding
axial symmetry on a membrane embedded in three spatial dimensions, we obtain a
wormhole solution whose shape is the same with the catenoidal solution of
Born-Infeld theory. We also discuss another interesting class of solutions,
membranes embedded holomorphically in four spatial dimensions, which are 1/4
BPS.
