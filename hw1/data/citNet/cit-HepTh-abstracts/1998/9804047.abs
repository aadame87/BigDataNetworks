  The ground, one- and two-particle states of the (1+1)-dimensional massive
sine-Gordon field theory are investigated within the framework of the Gaussian
wave-functional approach. We demonstrate that for a certain region of the
model-parameter space, the vacuum of the field system is asymmetrical.
Furthermore, it is shown that two-particle bound state can exist upon the
asymmetric vacuum for a part of the aforementioned region. Besides, for the
bosonic equivalent to the massive Schwinger model, the masses of the one boson
and two-boson bound states agree with the recent second-order results of a
fermion-mass perturbation calculation when the fermion mass is small.
