  We construct the duality groups for N=2 Supersymmetric QCD with gauge group
SU(2n+1) and N_f=4n+2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. The
groups are generated by two elements $S$ and $T$ that satisfy a relation
$(STS^{-1}T)^{2n+1}=1$. Thus, the groups are not subgroups of $SL(2,Z)$. We
also construct automorphic functions that map the fundamental region of the
group generated by $T$ and $STS$ to the Riemann sphere. These automorphic
functions faithfully represent the duality symmetry in the Seiberg-Witten
curve.
