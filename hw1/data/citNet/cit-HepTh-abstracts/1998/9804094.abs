  We have extended the perturbative expansion method around the Gaussian
effective action to the fermionic field theory, by taking the 2-dimensional
Gross-Neveu model as an example. We have computed both the zero temperature and
the finite temperature effective potentials of the Gross-Neveu model up to the
first perturbative correction terms, and have found that the critical
temperature, at which dynamically broken symmetry is restored, is significantly
improved for small value of the flavour number.
