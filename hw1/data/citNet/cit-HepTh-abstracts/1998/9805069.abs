  Motivated by the space-time uncertainty principle, we establish a conformal
symmetry in the dynamics of D-particles. The conformal symmetry, combined with
the supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem, uniquely determines the
classical form of the effective action for a probe D-particle in the background
of a heavy D-particle source, previously constructed by
Becker-Becker-Polchinski-Tseytlin. Our results strengthen the conjecture
proposed by Maldacena on the correspondence, in the case of D-particles,
between the supergravity and the supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrix models in the
large $N$-limit, the latter being the boundary conformal field theory of the
former in the classical D-particle background in the near horizon limit.
