  Working at the level of Poisson brackets, we describe the extension of the
generalized Wakimoto realization of a simple Lie algebra valued current, J, to
a corresponding realization of a group valued chiral primary field, b, that has
diagonal monodromy and satisfies $Kb'=Jb$. The chiral WZNW field b is subject
to a monodromy dependent exchange algebra, whose derivation is reviewed, too.
