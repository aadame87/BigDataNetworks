  Arguing that the equation for the gonihedric string should have a generalized
Dirac form, we found a new equation which corresponds to a symmetric solution
of the Majorana commutation relations and has non-Jacobian form. The
corresponding generalized gamma-matrices are anticommuting. Explicit formulas
for the mass spectrum lead to nonzero string tension $M^{2}_{j} \geq
M^{2}(j+1)^{2}$. We discuss also new dual transformation of the Dirac equation
and of the proposed generalizations.
