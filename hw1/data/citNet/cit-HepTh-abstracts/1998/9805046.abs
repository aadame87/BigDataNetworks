Title: On Asymptotic Hamiltonian for SU(N) Matrix Theory
Authors: A. Konechny
Comments: 13 pages, Latex; v2: a reference added; v3: References to the papers
  by M.B. Green and M. Gutperle are added. The complete calculation of the
  Witten index for SU(N) matrix theory follows from combination of the results
  of our paper with the results of M.B. Green and M. Gutperle and the results
  obtained by G. Moore, N. Nekrasov, and S. Shatashvili

  We compute the leading contribution to the effective Hamiltonian of SU(N)
matrix theory in the limit of large separation. We work with a gauge fixed
Hamiltonian and use generalized Born-Oppenheimer approximation, extending the
recent work of Halpern and Schwartz for SU(2). The answer turns out to be a
free Hamiltonian for the coordinates along the flat directions of the
potential. Applications to finding ground state candidates and calculation of
the correction (surface) term to Witten index are discussed.
