  In this talk, we give a brief discussion of complex monopole solutions in the
three dimensional Georgi-Glashow model with a Chern-Simons term. We find that
there exist complex monopole solutions of finite action. They dominate the path
integral and disorder the Higgs vacuum, but electric charges are not confined.
Subtleties in the model and issues related to Gribov copies are also noted.
