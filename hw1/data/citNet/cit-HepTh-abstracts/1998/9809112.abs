  We show that the chiral Gross-Neveu model in $2+ \epsilon$ dimensions has for
a small number $N$ of fermions two phase transitions corresponding to pair
formation and pair condensation.
  In the first transition, fermions and antifermions acquire spontaneously a
mass and are bound to pairs which behave like a Bose liquid in a chirally
symmetric state. In the second transition, the Bose liquid condenses into a
coherent state which breaks chiral symmetry. This suggests the possibility that
in particle physics, the generation of quark masses may also happen separately
from the breakdown of chiral symmetry.
