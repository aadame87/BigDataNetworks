  We obtain the characteristic equation for the nonlinear Born-Infeld
electrodynamics. This equation has the form of the characteristic equation for
the linear electrodynamics in some effective Riemann space. The effective
metric include the energy-momentum tensor components of electromagnetic field.
We study a distortion of light beams by the action of some distant solitons.
This distortion corresponds to attraction with the solitons and looks like the
gravitational distortion.
