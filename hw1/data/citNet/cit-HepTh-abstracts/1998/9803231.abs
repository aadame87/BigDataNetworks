  We construct a class of intersecting brane solutions with horizon geometries
of the form adS_k x S^l x S^m x E^n. We describe how all these solutions are
connected through the addition of a wave and/or monopoles. All solutions
exhibit supersymmetry enhancement near the horizon. Furthermore we argue that
string theory on these spaces is dual to specific superconformal field theories
in two dimensions whose symmetry algebra in all cases contains the large N=4
algebra A_{gamma}. Implications for gauged supergravities are also discussed.
