  The theory of the strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), has been
addressed by a variety of non-perturbative techniques over the decades since
its introduction. We have investigated Hamiltonian formulations with different
quantization methods and approximation schemes. In one method, we utilize
light-front coordinates to investigate the role of bosonic zero modes in
leading to confinement. In another method we are able to obtain spectra for the
mesons and baryons using constituent quark masses but no phenomenological
confinement. We survey our principal accomplishments to date and indicate our
future directions.
