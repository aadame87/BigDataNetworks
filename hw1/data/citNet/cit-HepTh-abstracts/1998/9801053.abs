  The entropy of the four dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is derived by
mapping it onto a configuration of intersecting branes with four charges. This
configuration is obtained by performing several boosts and dualities on a
neutral black brane of M-theory to which the Schwarzschild black hole is
related by trivial compactification. The infinite boost limit is well-defined
and corresponds to extremality where the intersecting brane configuration is a
marginal one on which a standard microscopic counting of the entropy can be
safely performed. The result reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
of the four dimensional black hole.
