Title: Quantum field theory can be UV finite if it is taken as effective one
Author: Jifeng Yang (Fudan Univ., Shanghai, P. R. China)
Comments: 11 pages, LaTex, no figures, an explanation of hep-th/9708104
\\
  This is a further explanation of a new and simple renormalization approach
recently proposed by the author (hep-th/9708104, Ref. [1], that is somewhat
sketchy) for any ordinary QFT (whether renormalizable or not) in any spacetime
dimension. We discussed the physical motivations of the new approach and its
efficiency when compared to the existent renormalization approaches. Some other
important issues related are briefly touched.
