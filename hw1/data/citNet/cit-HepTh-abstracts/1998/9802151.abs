  We study two dimensional $N=(4,4)$ supersymmetric gauge theories with various
gauge groups and various hypermultiplets in the fundamental as well as
bi-fundamental and adjoint representations. They have " mirror theories " which
become equivalent to them at the strong coupling. The theory with one
fundamental and one adjoint has a Higgs branch which is parametrized by the
adjoint matter. We also consider theories which involve an orientifold plane.
The brane realization of the Matrix theory formulation of NS 5-branes in Type
II string theories is also considered.
