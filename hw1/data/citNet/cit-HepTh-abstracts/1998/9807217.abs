  We investigate some properties of a system of Dirac fermions in 2+1
dimensions, with a space dependent mass having domain wall like defects.These
defects are defined by the loci of the points where the mass changes sign. In
general, they will be curves lying on the spatial plane. We show how to treat
the dynamics of the fermions in such a way that the existence of localized
fermionic zero modes on the defects is transparent. Moreover, effects due to
the higher, non zero modes, can be quantitatively studied. We also consider the
relevance of the profile of the mass near the region where it changes sign.
Finally, we apply our general results to the calculation of the induced
fermionic current, in the linear response approximation, in the presence of an
external electric field and defects.
