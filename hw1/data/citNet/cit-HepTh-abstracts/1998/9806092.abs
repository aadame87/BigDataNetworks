  We study the type IIB brane box configurations recently introduced by Hanany
and Zaffaroni. We show that even at finite string coupling, one can construct
smooth configurations of branes with fairly arbitrary gauge and flavor
structure. Limiting our attention to the better understood case where NS-branes
do not intersect over a four dimensional surface gives some restrictions on the
theories, but still permits many examples, both anomalous and non-anomalous. We
give several explicit examples of such configurations and discuss what
constraints can be imposed on brane-box theories from bending considerations.
We also discuss the relation between brane bending and beta-functions for
brane-box configurations.
