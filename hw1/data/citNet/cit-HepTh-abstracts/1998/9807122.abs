  It is well-known that all 2d models of gravity---including theories with
nonvanishing torsion and dilaton theories---can be solved exactly, if matter
interactions are absent. An absolutely (in space and time) conserved quantity
determines the global classification of all (classical) solutions. For the
special case of spherically reduced Einstein gravity it coincides with the mass
in the Schwarzschild solution. The corresponding Noether symmetry has been
derived previously by P. Widerin and one of the authors (W.K.) for a specific
2d model with nonvanishing torsion. In the present paper this is generalized to
all covariant 2d theories, including interactions with matter. The related
Noether-like symmetry differs from the usual one. The parameters for the
symmetry transformation of the geometric part and those of the matterfields are
distinct. The total conservation law (a zero-form current) results from a two
stage argument which also involves a consistency condition expressed by the
conservation of a one-form matter ``current''. The black hole is treated as a
special case.
