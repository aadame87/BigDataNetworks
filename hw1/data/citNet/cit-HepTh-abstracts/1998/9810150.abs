  Using the D3-brane as the fundamental tool, we adress two aspects of D-branes
physics. The first regards the interaction between two electromagnetic dual
D-branes in 10 dimensions. In particular, we give a meaning to {\it both} even
and odd spin structure contributions, the latter being non vanishing for non
zero relative velocity $v$ (and encoding the Lorentz-like contribution). The
second aspect regards the D-brane/black holes correspondence. We show how the 4
dimensional configuration corresponding to a {\it single} D3-brane wrapped on
the orbifold T^6/Z_3 represents a regular Reissner-Nordstrom solution of d=4
N=2 supergravity
