  We discuss the theoretical basis for the search of the possible experimental
manifestations of the torsion field at low energies. First, the quantum field
theory in an external gravitational field with torsion is reviewed. The
renormalizability requires the nonminimal interaction of torsion with spinor
and scalar (Higgs) fields. The Pauli-like equation contains new
torsion-dependent terms which have a different structure as compared with the
standard electromagnetic ones. The same concerns the nonrelativistic equations
for spin-${1}/{2}$ particle in an external torsion and electromagnetic fields.
Second, we discuss the propagating torsion. For the Dirac spinor coupled to the
electromagnetic and torsion field there is some additional softly broken local
symmetry associated with torsion. As a consequence of this symmetry, in the
framework of effective field theory, the torsion action is fixed with accuracy
to the values of the coupling constant of the torsion-spinor interaction, mass
of the torsion and higher derivative terms. The introduction of the Higgs field
spoils the consistency of this scheme, and the effective quantum field theory
for torsion embedded into the Standard Model is not possible. The
phenomenological consequences of the torsion-fermion interaction are drown and
the case of the torsion mass of the Planck order is discussed.
