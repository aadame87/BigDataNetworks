  We consider four dimensional heterotic compactifications on smooth elliptic
Calabi-Yau threefolds. Using spectral cover techniques, we study bundle
cohomology groups corresponding to charged matter multiplets. The analysis
shows that in generic situations, the resulting charged matter spectrum is
stable under deformations of the vector bundle.
