  An $\alpha$-parameter representation is derived for gauge field theories.It
involves, relative to a scalar field theory, only constants and derivatives
with respect to the $\alpha$-parameters. Simple rules are given to obtain the
$\alpha$-representation for a Feynman graph with an arbitrary number of loops
in gauge theories in the Feynman gauge.
