  We consider the one-loop effective action due to a spinor loop coupled to an
abelian vector and axial vector field background. After rewriting this
effective action in terms of an auxiliary non-abelian gauge connection, we use
the De Witt expansion to analyze both its anomalous and non-anomalous content.
The same transformation allows us to obtain a novel worldline path integral
representation for this effective action which avoids the usual separation into
the real and imaginary parts of the Euclidean effective action, as well as the
introduction of auxiliary dimensions.
