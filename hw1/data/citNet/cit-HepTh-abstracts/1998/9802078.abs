  The phase space path integral Wess-Zumino-Witten $\to$ Toda reductions are
formulated in a manifestly conformally invariant way. For this purpose, the
method of Batalin, Fradkin, and Vilkovisky, adapted to conformal field
theories, with chiral constraints, on compact two dimensional Riemannian
manifolds, is used. It is shown that the zero modes of the Lagrange multipliers
produce the Toda potential and the gradients produce the WZW anomaly. This
anomaly is crucial for proving the Fradkin-Vilkovisky theorem concerning gauge
invariance.
