Title: Some Functional Solutions of the Yang-Baxter Equation
Authors: D.Ts. Stoyanov

\\
  A general functional definition of the infinite dimensional quantum R-matrix
satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation is given. A procedure for extracting a
finite dimensional R-matrix from the general definition is demonstrated for the
particular cases of the group O(2) and of the group of translations.
