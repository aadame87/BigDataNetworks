  Conventional non-Abelian SO(4) gauge theory is able to describe gravity
provided the gauge field possesses a specific polarized vacuum state. In this
vacuum the instantons and anti-instantons have a preferred direction of
orientation. Their orientation plays the role of the order parameter for
the polarized phase of the gauge field. The interaction of a weak and smooth
gauge field with the polarized vacuum is described by an effective long-range
action which is identical to the Hilbert action of general relativity. In the
classical limit this action results in the Einstein equations of general
relativity. Gravitational waves appear as the mode describing propagation of
the gauge field which strongly interacts with the oriented instantons. The
Newton gravitational constant describes the density of the considered phase of
the gauge field. The radius of the instantons under consideration is comparable
with the Planck radius.
