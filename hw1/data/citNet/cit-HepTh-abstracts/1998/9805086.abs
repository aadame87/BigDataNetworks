  As argued by Witten on the basis of M-theory, QCD strings can end on domain
walls. We present an explanation of this effect in the framework of effective
field theories for the Polyakov loop and the gluino condensate in N=1
supersymmetric QCD. The domain walls separating confined phases with different
values of the gluino condensate are completely wet by a layer of deconfined
phase at the high-temperature phase transition. As a consequence, even at low
temperatures, the Polyakov loop has a non-vanishing expectation value on the
domain wall. Thus, close to the wall, the free energy of a static quark is
finite and the string emanating from it can end on the wall.
