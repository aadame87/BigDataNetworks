  We consider superconformal field theories in three and six dimensions with
eight supercharges which can be realized on the world-volume of M-theory branes
sitting at orbifold singularities. We find that they should admit a N=4 and N=2
supergravity dual in AdS_4 and AdS_7, respectively. We discuss the
characteristics of the corresponding gauged supergravities.
