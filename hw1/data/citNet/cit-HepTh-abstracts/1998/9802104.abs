Title: A Remark on the Geometry of Two-Dimensional Anisotropic Non-Linear
  Sigma-Models
Authors: D. H. T. Franco, M. S. Goes-Negrao, J. A. Helayel-Neto and A. R.

Comments: 11 pages, title changed, a new example of coset space was added that
  elucidates our claim
\\
  One discusses here the connection between \sigma-model gauge anomalies and
the existence of a connection with torsion that does not flatten the Ricci
tensor of the target manifold, by considering a number of non-symmetric coset
spaces. The influence of an eventual anisotropy on a certain direction of the
target manifold is also contemplated.
