  The 256 dimensional M2-brane multiplet contains solitons of many different
intrinsic spins. Using the broken supersymmetry transformations of the
M2-brane, we find supergravity solutions which explicitly display these spins.
This amounts to quantizing the fermionic zero modes and computing the back
reaction on the metric and gauge potential. These spacetime fields are
therefore operator valued and acquire a conventional classical meaning only
after taking expectations in given BPS states. Our spinning spacetimes are not
of the standard Kerr form -- there is a non-vanishing gravitino. Nevertheless,
the solutions have angular momentum and magnetic dipole moments with a g-factor
of 2. We use probe techniques to study scattering of spinning BPS M2-branes.
The static interactions cancel between like-sign branes at leading order, but
there are static spin-spin forces between branes and anti-branes. The general
probe-background Lagrangian contains gravitational spin-spin and magnetic
dipole-dipole forces, as well as gravitino exchanges which allow branes to
change fermion number.
