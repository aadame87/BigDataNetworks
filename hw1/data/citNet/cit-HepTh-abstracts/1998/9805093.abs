Title: Localization and Nonperturbative Local Quantum Physics
Author: B. Schroer (FU-Berlin)
Comments: This is a collection of lecture notes which will appear as CBPF
  "Notas de Aula". There are 3 parts: the tcilatex-file of the main text (235
  pages), a picture and an appendix which consists of a scanned article related
  to chapter 6.8. Because of its length this last file should only be openend
  after having read that chapter. Updated main file
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Mathematical Physics
\\
  The main content of this treatise is a new concept in nonperturbative
non-Lagrangian QFT which explains and extends the ad hoc constructions in
low-dimensional models and incorporates them together with the higher
dimensional theories into a new construction method. Thermal and entropical
properties, which were hitherto restricted to situations with classical
horizons (Killing vectors), are now generic (nonperturbative) aspects of
"modular localization". The underlying more algebraic (and less geometric) mode
of thinking also gives rise to interesting questions in renormalizable
deformatioms of higher spin fields, in particular gauge theories.
