  The most convenient tool to study the renormalization of a Lagrangian field
theory invariant under non linear local or global symmetries is the proper
solution to the master equation of the extended antifield formalism. It is
shown that, from the knowledge of the BRST cohomology, it is possible to
explicitly construct a further extension of the formalism containing all the
observables of the theory and satisfying an extended master equation, with some
of the features of the quantum Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation already
present at the classical level. This solution has the remarkable property that
all its infinitesimal deformations can be extended to complete deformations.
The deformed solutions differs from the original one through the addition of
terms related to coupling constant and anticanonical field-antifield
redefinitions. As a consequence, all theories admitting an invariant
regularization scheme are shown to be renormalizable while preserving the
symmetries, in the sense that both the subtracted and the effective action
satisfy the extended master equation, and this independently of power counting
restrictions. The anomalous case is also studied and a suitable definition of
the Batalin-Vilkovisky ``Delta'' operator in the context of dimensional
renormalization is proposed.
