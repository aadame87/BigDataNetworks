  In certain regions of the moduli space of K3 and Calabi-Yau manifolds,
D-branes wrapped on non-supersymmetric cycles may give rise to stable
configurations. We show that in the orbifold limit, some of these stable
configurations can be described by solvable boundary conformal field theories.
The world-volume theory of N coincident branes of this type is described by a
non-supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory. At the boundary of the region of
stability, there are marginal deformations connecting the non-supersymmetric
brane to a pair of D-branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles. We also discuss
various relationships between BPS and non-BPS D-branes of type II string
theories.
