  Some formal aspects of supersymmetry breaking are reviewed. The classic
"requirements" for supersymmetry breaking include chiral matter, a dynamical
superpotential, and a classical superpotential which completely lifts the
moduli space. These "requirements" may be evaded in theories with large matter
representations. The mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking by confinement and
quantum deformation of the moduli space are explained, with emphasis on the
importance of identifying the relevant degrees of freedom in the ground state.
Supersymmetry breaking and the behavior of the Witten index in non-chiral
theories are discussed. The quantum removal of directions which are classically
unlifted is also illustrated. Examples of product gauge group theories that
admit dual descriptions of the non-supersymmetric ground state are also
presented.
