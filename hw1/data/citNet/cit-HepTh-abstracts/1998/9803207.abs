  The BRST approach is applied to the description of irreducible massless
higher spins representations of the Poincare group in arbitrary dimensions. The
total system of constraints in such theory includes both the first and the
second class constraints. The corresponding nilpotent BRST charge contains
terms up to the seventh degree in ghosts.
