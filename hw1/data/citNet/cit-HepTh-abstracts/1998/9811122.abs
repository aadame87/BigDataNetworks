  It is pointed out that the entanglement entropy of quantum fields near the
horizon of a two-dimensional black hole can be derived by means of the
conformal field theory. This can be done in a way analogous to the computation
of the entropy of BTZ black holes. The important feature of the considered case
is that the degrees of freedom of the conformal theory are states localized in
the physical space-time.
