  We present a manifestly Lorentz invariant and supersymmetric component field
action for $D = 10$, type $IIB$ supergravity, using a newly developed method
for the construction of actions with chiral bosons, which implies only a single
scalar non propagating auxiliary field. With the same method we construct also
an action in which the complex two-form gauge potential and its Hodge-dual, a
complex six-form gauge potential, appear in a symmetric way in compatibility
with supersymmetry and Lorentz invariance. The duals of the two physical
scalars of the theory turn out to be described by a $SL(2,R)$ triplet of
eight-forms whose curvatures are constrained by a single linear relation.
 We present also a supersymmetric action in which the basic fields and their
duals, six-form and eight-form potentials, appear in a symmetric way. All these
actions are manifestly invariant under the global $SL(2,R)$-duality group of $D
= 10$, $IIB$ supergravity and are equivalent to each other in that their
dynamics corresponds to the well known equations of motion of $ D=10$, $IIB$
supergravity.
