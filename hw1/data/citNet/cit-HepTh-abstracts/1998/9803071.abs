  We study the logarithmic superconformal field theories. Explicitly, the
two-point functions of N=1 logarithmic superconformal field theories (LSCFT)
when the Jordan blocks are two (or more) dimensional, and when there are one
(or more) Jordan block(s) have been obtained. Using the well known three-point
fuctions of N=1 superconformal field theory (SCFT), three-point functions of
N=1 LSCFT are obtained. The general form of N=1 SCFT's four-point functions is
also obtained, from which one can easily calculate four-point functions in N=1
LSCFT.
