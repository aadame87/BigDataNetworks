\\
  It is shown that all affine Toda theories admit (1,0) supersymmetric
extensions. The construction is based on classical Lie algebras and
supersymmetric massive sigma models. The supersymmetrized affine Toda theories
have a unique, supersymmetric vacuum, their mass matrix is well defined and
their energy functional is positive semi-definite.
