  In the framework of a generalized iterative scheme introduced previously to
account for the non-analytic coupling dependence associated with the
renormalization-group invariant mass scale Lambda, we establish the
self-consistency equations of the extended Feynman rules (Lambda-modified
vertices of zeroth perturbative order) for the three-gluon vertex, the two
ghost vertices, and the two vertices of massless quarks. Calculations are
performed to one-loop-order, in Landau gauge, and at the lowest approximation
level (r=1) of interest for QCD. We discuss the phenomenon of compensating
poles inherent in these equations, by which the formalism automatically cancels
unphysical poles on internal lines, and the role of composite-operator
information in the form of equation-of-motion condensate conditions. The
observed near decoupling of the four-gluon conditions permits a solution to the
2-and-3-point conditions within an effective one-parameter freedom. There
exists a parameter range in which one solution has all vertex coefficients
real, as required for a physical solution, and a narrower range in which the
transverse-gluon and massless-quark propagators both exhibit complex-conjugate
pole pairs.
