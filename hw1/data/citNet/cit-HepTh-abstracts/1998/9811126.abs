  We present new rotating black brane solutions which solve Einstein's
equations with cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in arbitrary dimension $d$. For
negative $\Lambda$, the branes naturally appear in AdS supergravity
compactifications, and should therefore play some role in the AdS/CFT
correspondence. The spacetimes are warped products of a four-dimensional part
and an Einstein space of dimension $d-4$, which is not necessarily of constant
curvature. As a special subcase, the solutions contain the higher dimensional
generalization of the Kerr-AdS metric recently found by Hawking et al.
