  Several arguments are given for the summability of the superstring
perturbation series. Whereas the Schottky group coordinatization of moduli
space may be used to provide refined estimates of large-order bosonic string
amplitudes, the super-Schottky group variables define a measure for the
supermoduli space integral which leads to upper bounds on superstring
scattering amplitudes.
