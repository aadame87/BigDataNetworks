  The problem of Wu-Yang ambiguities in 3 dimensions is related to the problem
of existence of torsion free driebeins for an arbitrary potential. The
ambiguity is only at the level of boundary conditions. We also find that in 3
dimensions any smooth Yang-Mills field tensor can be uniquely written as the
non-Abelian magnetic field of a smooth Yang-Mills potential.
