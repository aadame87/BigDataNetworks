  It is shown that, under quite general conditions, thermal correlation
functions in relativistic quantum field theory have stronger analyticity
properties in configuration space than those imposed by the KMS-condition.
These analyticity properties may be understood as a remnant of the relativistic
spectrum condition in the vacuum sector and lead to a Lorentz-covariant
formulation of the KMS-condition involving all space-time variables.
