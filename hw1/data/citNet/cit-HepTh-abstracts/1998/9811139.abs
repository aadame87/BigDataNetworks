  We show that a set of parallel 3-brane probes near a conifold singularity can
be mapped onto a configuration of intersecting branes in type IIA string
theory. The field theory on the probes can be explicitly derived from this
formulation. The intersecting-brane metric for our model is obtained using
various dualities and related directly to the conifold metric. The M-theory
limit of this model is derived and turns out to be remarkably simple. The
global symmetries and counting of moduli are interpreted in the M-theory
picture.
