Title: Probing Matrix Black Holes
Authors: Miao Li and Emil Martinec

\\
  Black holes in matrix theory may consist of interacting clusters (correlated
domains) which saturate the uncertainty principle. We show that this assumption
qualitatively accounts for the thermodynamic properties of both charged and
neutral black holes, and reproduces the asymptotic geometry seen by probes.
