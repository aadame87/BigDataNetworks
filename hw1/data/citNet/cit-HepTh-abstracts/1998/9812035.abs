  We analyze a particular SU(2) invariant sector of the scalar manifold of
gauged N=8 supergravity in five dimensions, and find all the critical points of
the potential within this sector. The critical points give rise to Anti-de
Sitter vacua, and preserve at least an SU(2) gauge symmetry. Consistent
truncation implies that these solutions correspond to Anti-de Sitter
compactifications of IIB supergravity, and hence to possible near-horizon
geometries of 3-branes. Thus we find new conformal phases of softly broken N=4
Yang--Mills theory. One of the critical points preserves N=2 supersymmetry in
the bulk and is therefore completely stable, and corresponds to an N=1
superconformal fixed point of the Yang--Mills theory. The corresponding
renormalization group flow from the N=4 point has c_{IR}/c_{UV} = 27/32. We
also discuss the ten-dimensional geometries corresponding to these critical
points.
