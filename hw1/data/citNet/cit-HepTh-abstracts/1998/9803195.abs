  D-brane backgrounds are specified in closed string theories by holes with
appropriate mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the string
worldsheet. As presently stated, the prescription defining D-brane backgrounds
is such that the Einstein equation is not equivalent to the condition for scale
invariance on the string worldsheet. A modified D-brane prescription is found,
that leads to the desired equivalence, while preserving all known D-brane lore.
A possible interpretation is that the worldsheet cutoff is finite. Possible
connections to recent work of Maldacena and Strominger, and Gopakumar and Vafa
are suggested.
