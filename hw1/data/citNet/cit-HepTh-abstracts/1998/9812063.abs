  We describe three ways of modifying the relativistic Heisenberg algebra -
first one not linked with quantum symmetries, second and third related with the
formalism of quantum groups. The third way is based on the identification of
generalized deformed phase space with the semidirect product of two dual Hopf
algebras describing quantum group of motions and the corresponding quantum Lie
algebra. As an example the $\kappa$-deformation of relativistic Heisenberg
algebra is given, determined by $\kappa$-deformed D=4 Poincar\'{e} symmetries.
