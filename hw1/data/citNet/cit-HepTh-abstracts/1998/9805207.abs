  We discuss quotients of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime by a discrete group in
light of the AdS-CFT correspondence. Some quotients describe closed universes
which expand from zero volume to a maximum size and then contract. Maldacena's
conjecture suggests that they should be represented in string theory by
suitable quotients of the boundary conformal field theory. We discuss the
required identifications, and construct the states associated with the
linearized supergravity modes in the cosmological background.
