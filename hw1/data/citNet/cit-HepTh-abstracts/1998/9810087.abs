  It was recently shown that the renormalization of quantum field theory is
organized by the Hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees, whose coproduct
identifies the divergences requiring subtraction and whose antipode achieves
this. We automate this process in a few lines of recursive symbolic code, which
deliver a finite renormalized expression for any Feynman diagram. We thus
verify a representation of the operator product expansion, which generalizes
Chen's lemma for iterated integrals. The subset of diagrams whose forest
structure entails a unique primitive subdivergence provides a representation of
the Hopf algebra ${\cal H}_R$ of undecorated rooted trees. Our undecorated Hopf
algebra program is designed to process the 24,213,878 BPHZ contributions to the
renormalization of 7,813 diagrams, with up to 12 loops. We consider 10 models,
each in 9 renormalization schemes. The two simplest models reveal a notable
feature of the subalgebra of Connes and Moscovici, corresponding to the
commutative part of the Hopf algebra ${\cal H}_T$ of the diffeomorphism group:
it assigns to Feynman diagrams those weights which remove zeta values from the
counterterms of the minimal subtraction scheme. We devise a fast algorithm for
these weights, whose squares are summed with a permutation factor, to give
rational counterterms.
