  We study the large N limit of matrix models of M5-branes, or (2,0)
six-dimensional superconformal field theories, by making use of the
Bulk/Boundary correspondence. Our emphasis is on the relation between the
near-horizon limit of branes and the light-like limit of M-theory. In
particular we discuss a conformal symmetry in the D0 + D4 system, and interpret
it as a conformal symmetry in the discrete light-cone formulation of M5-branes.
We also compute two-point functions of scalars by applying the conjecture for
the AdS/CFT correspondence to the near-horizon geometry of boosted M5-branes.
We find an expected result up to a point subtle, but irrelevant to the IR
behavior of the theory. Our analysis matches with the Seiberg and Sen's
argument of a justification for the matrix model of M-theory.
