  We investigate the low energy dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric SO(N) gauge
theories with a single symmetric tensor matter field. These theories exhibit
non-trivial matching of global 't Hooft anomalies at the origin of moduli
space. We argue that their quantum moduli spaces possess distinct Higgs and
confining branches which touch at the origin in an interacting non-Abelian
Coulomb phase. The matching of anomalies between microscopic degrees of freedom
and colorless moduli therefore appears to be coincidental. We discuss a formal
mathematical relation between the SO(N) model and an analogous Sp(2N) theory
with a single antisymmetric matter field which provides an explanation for the
anomaly matching coincidence.
