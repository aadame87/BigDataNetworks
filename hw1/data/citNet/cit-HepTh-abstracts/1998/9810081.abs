  The superembedding approach to $p$-branes is used to study a class of
$p$-branes which have linear multiplets on the worldvolume. We refer to these
branes as L-branes. Although linear multiplets are related to scalar multiplets
(with 4 or 8 supersymmetries) by dualising one of the scalars of the latter to
a $p$-form field strength, in many geometrical situations it is the linear
multiplet version which arises naturally. Furthermore, in the case of 8
supersymmetries, the linear multiplet is off-shell in contrast to the scalar
multiplet. The dynamics of the L-branes are obtained by using a systematic
procedure for constructing the Green-Schwarz action from the superembedding
formalism. This action has a Dirac-Born-Infeld type structure for the $p$-form.
In addition, a set of equations of motion is postulated directly in superspace,
and is shown to agree with the Green-Schwarz equations of motion.
