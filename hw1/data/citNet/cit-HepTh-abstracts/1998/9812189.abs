\\
  Several quantum mechanical wave equations for $p$-branes are proposed based
on the role that the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms group has on the physics
of extended objects. The $p$-brane quantum mechanical wave equations determine
the quantum dynamics involving the creation/destruction of $p$-branes in a $D$
dimensional spacetime background with a given world-volume measure
configuration in a given quantum state $\Psi$.
