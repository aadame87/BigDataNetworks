  Using the well-known Chern-Weil formula and its generalization, we
systematically construct the Chern-Simons forms and their generalization
induced by torsion as well as the Nieh-Yan (N-Y) forms. We also give an
argument on the vanishing of integration of N-Y form on any compact manifold
without boundary. A systematic construction of N-Y forms in D=4n dimension is
also given.
