  We construct N=1 supersymmetric versions of four-dimensional
Freedman-Townsend models and generalizations thereof found recently by Henneaux
and Knaepen, with couplings between 1-form and 2-form gauge potentials. The
models are presented both in a superfield formulation with linearly realized
supersymmetry and in WZ gauged component form. In the latter formulation the
supersymmetry transformations are nonlinear and do not commute with all the
gauge transformations. Among others, our construction yields N=1 counterparts
of recently found N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories involving vector-tensor
multiplets with gauged central charge.
