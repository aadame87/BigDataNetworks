  We study the time development of correlation functions at both zero and
finite temperature with Shibata-Hashitsume's projection operator method and
carry out the renormalization of ultraviolet divergence that appears in a
time-dependent frequency shift, using a mass counter term. A harmless
divergence of log t-type remains at an initial time t=0 after the lowest order
renormalization.
