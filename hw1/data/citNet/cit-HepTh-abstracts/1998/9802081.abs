  We derive Ward-Takahashi identities including composite fields in Abelian
gauge theories and the matching condition between the elementary field
description and the composite field description. With these we develop an
approach to dynamical symmetry breaking in Abelian gauge theories including the
study of the dynamically generated masses of the gauge boson, the fermions and
the composite Higgs field. The Cornwall-Norton, Jackiw-Johnson and Schwinger
models are taken as examples of the application. The obtained gauge boson
masses are in agreement with the existing results. In this appraoch, we are
able to further obtain new results for the mass of the composite Higgs boson
and the goldstone boson decay constant.
