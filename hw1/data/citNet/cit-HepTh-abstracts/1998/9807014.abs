  We present fivedimensional extreme black hole solutions of M-theory
compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds and study these solutions in the context
of flop transitions in the extended Kahler cone. In particular we consider a
specific model and present black hole solutions, breaking half of N=2
supersymmetry, in two regions of the extended Kahler cone, which are connected
by a flop transition. The conditions necessary to match both solutions at the
flop transition are analysed. Finally we also discuss the conditions to obtain
massless black holes at the flop transition.
