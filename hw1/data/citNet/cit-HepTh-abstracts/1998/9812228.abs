  Different models with nonabelian homogeneous condensate fields are considered
in the one-loop approximation. Effective action in a model of gluodynamics in
curved space is calculated. Free energy and its minimum in a (2+1)-dimensional
model of QCD are investigated. Photon polarization operator (PO) is obtained.
