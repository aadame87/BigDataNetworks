  In the previous paper (hep-th/9712161) it was shown that the nonlinear
Born-Infeld field equations supplemented by the "dynamical condition" (certain
boundary condition for the field along the particle's trajectory) define
perfectly deterministic theory, i.e. particle's trajectory is determined
without any equations of motion. In the present paper we show that this theory
possesses mathematically consistent Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations.
Moreover, it turns out that the "dynamical condition" is already present in the
definition of the physical phase space and, therefore, it is a basic element of
the theory.
