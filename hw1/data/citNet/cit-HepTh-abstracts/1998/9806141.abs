  Five-dimensional non-extreme rotating black holes with large NS-NS five-brane
and fundamental string charge are shown to be described by a conformal sigma
model, which is a marginal integrable deformation of six-dimensional SL(2,R) x
SU(2) WZW model. The two WZW levels are equal to the five-brane charge, while
the parameters of the two marginal deformations generated by the left and right
chiral SU(2) currents are proportional to the two angular momentum components
of the black hole. The near-horizon description is effectively in terms of a
free fundamental string whose tension is rescaled by the five-brane charge. The
microstates are identified with those of left and right moving superconformal
string oscillations in the four directions transverse to the five-brane. Their
statistical entropy reproduces precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the
rotating black hole.
