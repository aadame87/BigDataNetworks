  I argue that for the case of fermions with nonzero bare mass there is a term
in the matter density operator in the light-cone representation which has been
omitted from previous calculations. The new term provides agreement with
previous results in the equal-time representation for mass perturbation theory
in the massive Schwinger model. For the DLCQ case the physics of the new term
can be represented by an effective operator which acts in the DLCQ subspace,
but the form of the term might be hard to guess and I do not know how to
determine its coefficient from symmetry considerations.
