  The relativistic complex scalar field at finite temperature and in presence
of a net conserved charge is studied in reference to recent developments on the
multiplicative anomaly. This quantity, overlooked until now, is computed and it
is shown how it could play a role for this system. Other possible applications
are also mentioned.
