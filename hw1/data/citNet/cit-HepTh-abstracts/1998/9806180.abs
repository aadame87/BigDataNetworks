  We discuss twisted states of AdS orbifolds which couple to N=2 chiral primary
operators not invariant under exchange of the gauge factors. Kaluza-Klein
reduction on the fixed circle gives the correct conformal dimensions of
operators in the superconformal theory and involves some aspects of monopole
dynamics in the non-trivial background. As a byproduct we found evidence for
decoupling of U(1) factors in the four-dimensional gauge theory.
