  In this paper we use the matrix string approach to begin a study of high
energy scattering processes in M-theory. In particular we exhibit an
instanton-type configuration in 1+1 super-Yang-Mills theory that can be
interpreted as a non-perturbative description of a string interaction. This
solution is used to describe high energy processes with non-zero longitudinal
momentum exchange, in which an arbitrary number of eigenvalues get transferred
between the two scattering states. We describe a direct correspondence between
these semi-classical SYM configurations and the Gross-Mende saddle points. We
also study in detail the pair production of D-particles via a one-loop
calculation which in the 1+1D gauge theory language is described by the
(perturbative) transition between states with different electric flux. Finally,
we discuss a possible connection between these calculations in which D-particle
production gives important corrections to the Gross-Mende process.
