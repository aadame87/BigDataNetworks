  We reexamine the solvable model problem of two static, fundamental quarks
interacting with a SU(2) Yang-Mills field on a spatial circle, introduced by
Engelhardt and Schreiber. If the quarks are at the same point, the model
exhibits a quantum mechanical supersymmetry. At finite separation, the
supersymmetry is explicitly broken in a way which naturally explains the
geometrical nature of spectrum and state vectors of this system.
