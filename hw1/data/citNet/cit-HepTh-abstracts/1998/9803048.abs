  We study the properties of wrapped membranes in matrix theory on ALE spaces.
We show that the only BPS bound states of wrapped membranes that can form are
roots of the $A$-$D$-$E$ group. We determine a bound on the energy of a bound
state and find the correct dependence on the blow-up parameters and
longitudinal momentum expected from M-Theory. For the $A_{n-1}$ series, we
construct explicit classical solutions for the wrapped membrane bound states.
These states have a very rich structure and have a natural interpretation in
terms of noncommutative geometry. In the $A_1$ case, we examine the spectrum of
excitations around the wrapped membrane solution and provide an explicit
calculation of their energies. The results agree exactly with supergravity
calculations.
