Title: Effective action for Dirac spinors in the uniform electromagnetic
  background fields
Authors: Roberto Soldati, Lorenzo Sorbo

  International Conference on Path-Integrals from peV to TeV, Firenze
\\
  Some new expressions are found, concerning the effective action as a
regularized path-integral for Dirac's spinors in {\it 3+1} dimensions, in the
presence of general uniform (i.e., constant and homogeneous) electric and
magnetic fields. The rate of $e^+e^-$ pairs production is computed and briefly
discussed.
