Title: The Graviton in the AdS-CFT correspondence: Solution via the Dirichlet
  Boundary value problem
Authors: W. M\"uck and K. S. Viswanathan
Comments: 12 pages, LaTeX2e with amsmath, amsfonts packages
\\
  Using the AdS-CFT correspondence we calculate the two point function of CFT
energy momentum tensors. The AdS gravitons are considered by explicitly
solving the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $x_0=\epsilon$. We consider
this treatment as complementary to existing work, with which we make contact.
