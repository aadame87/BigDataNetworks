Title: A Note on AdS/SYM Correspondence on the Coulomb Branch
Authors: Yi-Yen Wu (Johns Hopkins University)
Comments: LaTeX, 11 pages. Four references are added. Two remarks (a note in
  Sec.1, and Footnote 5) concerning M2-branes in AdS_4 and M5-branes in AdS_7
  are added. A typo in Footnote 5 is corrected
Report-no: JHU-TIPAC-98009
\\
  We study Maldacena's conjecture and the AdS/SYM correspondence on the Coulomb
branch. Several interesting aspects of this conjectured AdS/SYM correspondence
on the Coulomb branch are pointed out and clarified.
