Title: Linear Stability of Dilatonic Black Holes
Author: Panagiota Kanti (University of Ioannina)
Comments: Latex2e, 11 pages, 3 postscript figures included, Talk presented at
  the "International Workshop on Recent Developments in High Energy Physics"
  organized by the Hellenic Society for the Study of High Energy Physics at
  Democritos NRC, Athens, Greece, April 9-11, 1998
\\
  In this talk, we recall the most important features of the Dilatonic Black
Holes which arise in the framework of the Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet theory
and which are dressed with a classical long range dilaton field in
contradiction with the existing "no-hair" theorems of the Theory of General
Relativity. We demonstrate linear stability of these black hole solutions under
small spacetime-dependent perturbations by making use of a semi-analytic method
based on the Fubini-Sturm's theorem. As a result, the Dilatonic Black Holes
constitute one of the very few examples of stable black hole solutions with
non-trivial "hair" that arise in the framework of a more generalised theory of
gravity.
