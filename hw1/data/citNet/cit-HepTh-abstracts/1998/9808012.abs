  We formulate the notion of parity for the periodic XXZ spin chain within the
Quantum Inverse Scattering Method. We also propose an expression for the
eigenvalues of the charge conjugation operator. We use these discrete
symmetries to help classify low-lying S^z=0 states in the critical regime, and
we give a direct computation of the S matrix.
