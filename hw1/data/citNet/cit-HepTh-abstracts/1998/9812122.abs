Title: On the Effective Potential for Local Composite Operators
Authors: E. V. Gorbar (Instituto de Fisica Teorica, Sao Paulo, Brazil)
Comments: 17 pages, LaTeX, the analysis of the O(N) model with finite cut-off
  have been reconsidered and the corresponding important reference have been
  added

  We show that the effective potential for local composite operators is a
useful object in studing dynamical symmetry breaking by calculating the
effective potential for the local composite operators $\bar{\psi} \psi$ and
$\phi^2$ in the Gross-Neveu (GN) and O(N) models, respectively. Since the
effective potential for local composite operators can be calculated by using
the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective potential in theory with
additional bare mass terms, we show that divergences in the effective potential
for local composite operators are the same as in the CJT effective potential.
We compare the results obtained with the results give by the auxiliary field
method.
