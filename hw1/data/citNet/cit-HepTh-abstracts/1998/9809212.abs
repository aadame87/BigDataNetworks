  We study the classical and quantum motion of a relativistic charged particle
on the spacetime produced by a global monopole. The self-potential, which is
present in this spacetime, is considered as an external electrostatic
potential. We obtain classical orbits and quantum states for a spin-1/2 and
spin-0 particles.
