  We derive some explicit expressions for correlators on Grassmannian G_r(C^n)
as well as on the moduli space of holomorphic maps, of a fixed degree d, from
sphere into the Grassmannian. Correlators obtained on the Grassmannain are a
first step generalization of the Schubert formula for the self-intersection.
The intersection numbers on the moduli space for r=2,3 are given explicitly by
two closed formulas, when r=2 the intersection numbers, are found to generate
the alternate Fibonacci numbers, the Pell numbers and in general a random walk
of a particle on a line with absorbing barriers. For r=3 the intersection
numbers form a well organized pattern.
