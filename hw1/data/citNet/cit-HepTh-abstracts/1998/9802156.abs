  This paper is a brief review of background field method and some of its
applications in N=2 super Yang-Mills theories with a matter within harmonic
superspace approach. A general structure of effective action is discussed, an
absence of two-loop quantum corrections to first non-leading term in effective
action is proved and N=2 non-renormalization theorem in this approach is
considered.
