  D0-brane gas picture of Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) is considered in the
large N regime of Matrix theory. An entropy formula, which reproduces the
thermodynamics of SBH in the large N limit for all dimensions ($D\geq 6$), is
proposed. The equations of states for low temperature are obtained. We also
give a proof of the Newton gravitation law between two SBHs, whose masses are
not equal. Our result in some extent supports that the physics of Matrix theory
is Lorentz invariant.
