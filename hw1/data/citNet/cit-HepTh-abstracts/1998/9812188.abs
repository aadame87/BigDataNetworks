  We construct the effective action of the KK-monopole in a massive Type IIA
background. We follow two approaches. First we construct a massive M-theory
KK-monopole from which the IIA monopole is obtained by double dimensional
reduction. This eleven dimensional monopole contains two isometries: one under
translations of the Taub-NUT coordinate and the other under massive
transformations of the embedding coordinates. Secondly, we construct the
massive T-duality rules that map the Type IIB NS-5-brane onto the massive Type
IIA KK-monopole. This provides a check of the action constructed from eleven
dimensions.
