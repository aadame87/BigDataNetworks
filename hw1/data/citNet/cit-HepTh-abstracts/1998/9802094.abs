  In this talk we discuss the description of the moduli space of principal
G-bundles on an elliptic fibration X-->S in terms of cameral covers and their
distinguished Prym varieties. We emphasize the close relationship between this
problem and the integrability of Hitchin's system and its generalizations. The
discussion roughly parallels that of [D2], but additional examples are included
and some important steps of the argument are illustrated. Some of the
applications to heterotic/F-theory duality were described in the accompanying
ICMP talk (hep-th/9802093).
