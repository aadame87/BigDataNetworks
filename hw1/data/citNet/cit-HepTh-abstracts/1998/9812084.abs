  It was recently pointed out by E. Witten that for a D-brane to consistently
wrap a submanifold of some manifold, the normal bundle must admit a Spin^c
structure. We examine this constraint in the case of type II string
compactifications with vanishing cosmological constant, and argue that in all
such cases, the normal bundle to a supersymmetric cycle is automatically
Spin^c.
