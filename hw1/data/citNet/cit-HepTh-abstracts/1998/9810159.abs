  We study the duality relationship between M-theory and heterotic string
theory at the classical level, emphasising the transformations between the
Kaluza-Klein reductions of these two theories on the K3 and T^3 manifolds.
Particular attention is devoted to the corresponding structures of sigma-model
cosets and the correspondence between the p-brane charge lattices. We also
present simple and detailed derivations of the global symmetries and coset
structures of the toroidally-compactified heterotic theory in all dimensions D
\ge 3, making use of the formalism of solvable Lie algebras.
