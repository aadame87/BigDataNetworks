  We give a classification and overview of the confining N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theories. For simplicity we consider only theories based on simple gauge
groups and no tree-level superpotential. Classification of these theories can
be done according to whether or not there is a superpotential generated for the
confined degrees of freedom. The theories with the superpotential include
s-confining theories and also theories where the gauge fields participate in
the confining spectrum, while theories with no superpotential include theories
with a quantum deformed moduli space and theories with an affine moduli space.
