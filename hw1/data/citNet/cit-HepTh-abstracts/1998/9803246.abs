  We consider the gravitationally induced particle production from the quantum
vacuum which is defined by a free, massless and minimally coupled scalar field
during the formation of a gauge cosmic string. Previous discussions of this
topic estimate the power output per unit length along the string to be of the
order of $10^{68}$ ergs/sec/cm in the s-channel. We find that this production
may be completely suppressed. A similar result is also expected to hold for the
number of produced photons.
