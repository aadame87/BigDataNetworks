  The structure of counterterms in higher derivative quantum gravity is
reexamined. Nontrivial dependence of charges on the gauge and parametrization
is established. Explicit calculations of two-loop contributions are carried out
with the help of the generalized renormgroup method demonstrating consistency
of the results obtained.
