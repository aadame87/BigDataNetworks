Title: Ground State Energy for Massive Fields and Renormalisation
Authors: M Bordag
Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures, Latex, corrected for an incorrect statement in
  the massless case

  We discuss the renormalisation of the ground state energy of massive fields
obeying boundary conditions, i.e., of the Casimir effect, and emphasise the
role of the mass for its understanding. This is an extended abstract of a talk
given at the topical group meeting on Casimir Forces at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics on March 15-29, 1998.
