  The massive Schwinger model may be analysed by a perturbation expansion in
the fermion mass. However, the results of this mass perturbation theory are
sensible only for sufficiently small fermion mass. By performing a
renormal-ordering, we arrive at a chiral perturbation expansion where the
expansion parameter remains small even for large fermion mass. We use this
renormal-ordered chiral perturbation theory for a computation of the Schwinger
mass and compare our results with lattice computations.
