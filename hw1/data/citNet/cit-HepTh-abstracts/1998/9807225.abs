  We consider (3 + 1)-dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills theory with a
nonvanishing scalar Higgs vacuum expectation value, and compare this theory to
AdS supergravity with branes in the bulk. We show that the one-loop effective
potential for excitations of the Yang-Mills field agrees with the classical
linearized potential for brane waves in the AdS picture in the limit of long
wavelengths. This supports the idea that the AdS/CFT correspondance fits into
string theory as expected from previous work.
