  We study string propagation on $AdS_3$ times a compact space from an ``old
fashioned'' worldsheet point of view of perturbative string theory. We derive
the spacetime CFT and its Virasoro and current algebras, thus establishing the
conjectured $AdS$/CFT correspondence for this case in the full string theory.
Our results have implications for the extreme IR limit of the $D1-D5$ system,
as well as to 2+1 dimensional BTZ black holes and their Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy.
