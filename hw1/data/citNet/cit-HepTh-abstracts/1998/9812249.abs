  We consider D-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with 8 supercharges
(D<6,$~\cN=8$) in the framework of harmonic superspaces. The effective Abelian
low-energy action for D=5 contains the free and Chern-Simons terms. Effective
$\cN=8$ superfield actions for D<4 can be written in terms of the
superpotentials satisfying the superfield constraints and (6-D)-dimensional
Laplace equations. The role of alternative harmonic structures is discussed.
