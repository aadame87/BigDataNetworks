  We consider the (1,0) supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet coupled to a
self-dual tensor multiplet in six dimensions. It is shown that the counterterm
required to cancel the one-loop gauge anomaly modifies the classical equations
of motion previously obtained by Bergshoeff, Sezgin and Sokatchev (BSS). We
discuss the supermultiplet structure of the anomalies exhibited in the
resulting equations of motion. The anomaly corrected field equations agree with
the global limit, recently obtained by Duff, Liu, Lu and Pope, of a matter
coupled supergravity theory in six dimensions. We also obtain the dual
formulation of the BSS model in which the tensor multiplet is free while the
field equations of the Yang-Mills multiplet contain the fields of the tensor
multiplet at the classical level.
