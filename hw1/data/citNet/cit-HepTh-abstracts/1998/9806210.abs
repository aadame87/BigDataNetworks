  In some recent papers it is claimed that the physical significance of the
vacuum angle theta for QCD-like theories depends on the chosen gauge condition.
We criticise the arguments that were given in support of this claim, and show
by explicit construction for the case of QED$_2$ that and why they fail,
confirming thereby the commonly accepted point of view.
