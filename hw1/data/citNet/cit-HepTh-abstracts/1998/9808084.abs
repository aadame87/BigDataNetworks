  The space-time disclination is studied by making use of the decomposition
theory of gauge potential in terms of antisymmetric tensor field and
$\phi$-mapping method. It is shown that the self-dual and anti-self-dual parts
of the curvature compose the space-time disclinations which are classified in
terms of topological invariants--winding number. The projection of space-time
disclination density along an antisymmetric tensor field is quantized
topologically and characterized by Brouwer degree and Hopf index.
