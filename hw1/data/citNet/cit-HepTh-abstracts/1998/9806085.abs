  We show that a simple OSp(1/2) worldline gauge theory in 0-brane phase space
(X,P), with spin degrees of freedom, formulated for a d+2 dimensional spacetime
with two times X^0,, X^0', unifies many physical systems which ordinarily are
described by a 1-time formulation. Different systems of 1-time physics emerge
by choosing gauges that embed ordinary time in d+2 dimensions in different
ways. The embeddings have different topology and geometry for the choice of
time among the d+2 dimensions. Thus, 2-time physics unifies an infinite number
of 1-time physical interacting systems, and establishes a kind of duality among
them. One manifestation of the two times is that all of these physical systems
have the same quantum Hilbert space in the form of a unique representation of
SO(d,2) with the same Casimir eigenvalues. By changing the number n of spinning
degrees of freedom the gauge group changes to OSp(n/2). Then the eigenvalue of
the Casimirs of SO(d,2) depend on n and then the content of the 1-time physical
systems that are unified in the same representation depend on n. The models we
study raise new questions about the nature of spacetime.
