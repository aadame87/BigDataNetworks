  We compute the interaction potential between two parallel transversely
boosted wrapped membranes (with fixed momentum $p_-$) in D=11 supergravity with
compact light-like direction. We show that the supergravity result is in exact
agreement with the potential following from the all-order Born-Infeld-type
action conjectured to be the leading planar infra-red part of the quantum super
Yang-Mills effective action. This provides a non-trivial test of consistency of
the arguments relating Matrix theory to a special limit of type II string
theory. We also find the potential between two (2+0) D-brane bound states in
D=10 supergravity (corresponding to the case of boosted membrane configuration
in 11-dimensional theory compactified on a space-like direction). We
demonstrate that the result reduces to the SYM expression for the potential in
the special low-energy ($\a'\to 0$) limit, in agreement with previous
suggestions. In appendix we derive the action obtained from the D=11 membrane
action by the world-volume duality transformation of the light-like coordinate
$x^-$ into a 3-vector.
