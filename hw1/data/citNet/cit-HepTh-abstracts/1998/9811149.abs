  We investigate the quantum conformal algebras of N=2 and N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theories. Phenomena occurring at strong coupling are analysed using the
Nachtmann theorem and very general, model-independent, arguments. The results
lead us to introduce a novel class of conformal field theories, identified by a
closed quantum conformal algebra. We conjecture that they are the exact
solution to the strongly coupled large-N_c limit of the open conformal field
theories. We study the basic properties of closed conformal field theory and
work out the operator product expansion of the conserved current multiplet T.
The OPE structure is uniquely determined by two central charges, c and a. The
multiplet T does not contain just the stress-tensor, but also R-currents and
finite mass operators. For this reason, the ratio c/a is different from 1. On
the other hand, an open algebra contains an infinite tower of non-conserved
currents, organized in pairs and singlets with respect to renormalization
mixing. T mixes with a second multiplet T* and the main consequence is that c
and a have different subleading corrections. The closed algebra simplifies
considerably at c=a, where it coincides with the N=4 one.
