  Following Kachru, Kumar and Silverstein, we construct a set of
non-supersymmetric Type II string models which have equal numbers of bosons and
fermions at each mass level. The models are asymmetric {\bf Z}_2 \otimes {\bf
Z}_2^{\prime} orbifolds. We demonstrate that this bose-fermi degeneracy feature
implies that both the one-loop and the two-loop contributions to the
cosmological constant vanish. We conjecture that the cosmological constant
actually vanishes to all loops. We construct a strong-weak dual pair of models,
both of which have bose-fermi degeneracy. This implies that at least some of
the non-perturbative corrections to the cosmological constant are absent.
