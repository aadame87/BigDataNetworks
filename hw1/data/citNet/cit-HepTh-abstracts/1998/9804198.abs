  Light Cone Gauge

  In this work we present a proof of the discreteness of the spectrum for
bosonic membrane, in a flat minkowski space. This may be useful to show the
quantum mechanical consistence of others bosonics extended models. This proof
includes the BRST residual symmetry and was directly performed over the
discretized membrane model. The BRST residual invariant effective action is
explicity constructed.
