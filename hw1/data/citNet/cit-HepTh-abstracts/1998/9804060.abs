  We analyze the large $N$ spectrum of chiral primary operators of three
dimensional fixed points of the renormalization group. Using the space-time
picture of the fixed points and the correspondence between anti-de Sitter
compactifications and conformal field theories we are able to extract the
dimensions of operators in short superconformal multiplets. We write down some
of these operators in terms of short distance theories flowing to these
non-trivial fixed points in the infrared.
