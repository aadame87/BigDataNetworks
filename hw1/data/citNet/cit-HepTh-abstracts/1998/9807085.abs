  We give a reinterpretation of the matrix theory discussed by Moore, Nekrasov
and Shatashivili (MNS) in terms of the second quantized operators which
describes the homology class of the Hilbert scheme of points on surfaces. It
naturally relate the contribution from each pole to the inner product of
orthogonal basis of free boson Fock space. These basis can be related to the
eigenfunctions of Calogero-Sutherland (CS) equation and the deformation
parameter of MNS is identified with coupling of CS system. We discuss the
structure of Virasoro symmetry in this model.
