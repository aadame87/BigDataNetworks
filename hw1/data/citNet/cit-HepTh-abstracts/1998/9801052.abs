  The derivation of the conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled electromagnetic
field in curved space is presented. The models of this sort naturally appear in
stringy gravity or after spherical reduction of multidimensional
Einstein-Maxwell theory. It is shown that unlike the case of minimal vector in
curved space or dilaton coupled scalar the anomaly induced effective action
cannot be derived. The reason is the same why anomaly induced effective action
cannot be constructed for interacting theories (like QED) in curved space.
