  topological quantization

  In the light of $\phi $--mapping method and topological current theory, the
topological structure and the topological quantization of arbitrary dimensional
topological defects are investigated. It is pointed out that the topological
quantum numbers of the defects are described by the Winding numbers of $\phi
$--mapping which are determined in terms of the Hopf indices and the Brouwer
degrees of $\phi$--mapping. Furthermore, it is shown that all the topological
defects are generated from where $\vec \phi =0$, i.e. from the zero points of
the $\phi $--mapping.
