  We discuss the effects of instantons in partially broken gauge groups on the
low-energy effective gauge theory. Such effects arise when some of the
instantons of the original gauge group G are no longer contained in (or can not
be gauge rotated into) the unbroken group H. In cases of simple G and H, a good
indicator for the existence of such instantons is the ``index of embedding.''
However, in the general case one has to examine \pi_3(G/H) to decide whether
there are any instantons in the broken part of the gauge group. We give several
examples of supersymmetric theories where such instantons exist and leave their
effects on the low-energy effective theory.
