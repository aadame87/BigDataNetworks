  Recently, the AdS/CFT conjecture of Maldacena has been investigated in
Lorentzian signature by Balasubramanian et. al. We extend this investigation to
Lorentzian BTZ black hole spacetimes, and study the bulk and boundary behaviour
of massive scalar fields both in the non-extremal and extremal case. Using the
bulk-boundary correspondence, we also evaluate the two-point correlator of
operators coupling to the scalar field at the boundary of the spacetime, and
find that it satisfies thermal periodic boundary conditions relevant to the
Hawking temperature of the BTZ black hole.
