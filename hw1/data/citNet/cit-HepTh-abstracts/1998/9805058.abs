  We study topological A-model disk amplitudes with Calabi-Yau target spaces by
mirror symmetries. This allows us to calculate holomorphic instantons of
Riemann surfaces with boundaries that are mapped into susy cycles in Calabi-Yau
d-folds. Also we analyse disk amplitudes in Fano manifold cases by considering
fusion relations between A-model operators.
