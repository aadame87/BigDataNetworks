  It is well-known that the low energy string theory admits a non-singular
solitonic super five-brane solution which is the magnetic dual to the
fundamental string solution. By using the symmetry of the type IIB string
theory, we construct an SL(2, Z) multiplet of magnetically charged super
five-branes starting from this solitonic solution. These solutions are
characterized by two integral three-form charges $(q_1, q_2)$ and are stable
when the integers are coprime. We obtain an expression for the tension of these
$(q_1, q_2)$ five-branes as envisaged by Witten. The SL(2, Z) multiplets of
black strings and black fivebranes and the existence of similar magnetic dual
solutions of strings in type II string theory in $D < 10$ have also been
discussed.
