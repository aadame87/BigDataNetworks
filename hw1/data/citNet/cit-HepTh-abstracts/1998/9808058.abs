  Bosonisation of the massive Thirring model, with a non-minimal and
non-abelian gauging is studied in 2+1-dimensions. The static abelian model is
solved completely in the large fermion mass limit and the spectrum is obtained.
The non-abelian model is solved for a restricted class of gauge fields. In both
cases explicit expressions for bosonic currents corresponding to the fermion
currents are given.
