Title: Particle Physics and QFT at the Turn of the Century Old principles with
  new concepts (an essay on local quantum physics)
Authors: Bert Schroer (presently CBPF Rio de Janeiro)
Comments: This is an invited contribution to the special Y2K issue of JMP. The
  Title and part of the original content of my notes hep-th/9810080 was used in
  the present essay

  The present state of QFT is analysed from a new viewpoint whose mathematical
basis is the modular theory of von Neumann algebras. Its physical consequences
suggest new ways of dealing with interactions, symmetries, Hawking-Unruh
thermal properties and possibly also extensions of the scheme of renormalized
perturbation theory. Interactions are incorporated by using the fact that the
S-matrix is a relative modular invariant of the interacting- relative to the
incoming- net of wedge algebras. This new point of view allows many interesting
comparisions with the standard quantization approach to QFT and is shown to be
firmly rooted in the history of QFT. Its radical ``change of paradigm'' aspect
becomes particularily visible in the quantum measurement problem. Key words:
Quantum Field Theory, S-matrix Theory, Tomita-Takesaki Modular Theory.
