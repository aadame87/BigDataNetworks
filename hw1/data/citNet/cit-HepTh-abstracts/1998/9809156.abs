  This paper reviews some recent work on (s)pin structures and the Dirac
operator on hypersurfaces (in particular, on spheres), on real projective
spaces and quadrics. Two approaches to spinor fields on manifolds are compared.
The action of space and time reflections on spinors is discussed, also for
two-component (chiral) spinors.
