  We review some aspects of minimal cycles in string compactifications and
their role in constructing new critical theories in six and lower dimensions as
well as in accounting for black hole entropy. (Based on a talk presented at the
Salam Memorial Meeting, the Abdus Salam International Center for Theoretical
Physics, Fall 1997)
