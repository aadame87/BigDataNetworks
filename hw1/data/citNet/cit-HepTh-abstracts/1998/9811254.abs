  The Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) of a supersymmetric SU(N) gauge
theory in 1+1 dimensions is discussed, with particular emphasis given to the
inclusion of all dynamical zero modes. Interestingly, the notorious `zero-mode
problem' is now tractable because of special supersymmetric cancellations. In
particular, we show that anomalous zero-mode contributions to the currents are
absent, in contrast to what is observed in the non-supersymmetric case. We find
that the supersymmetric partner of the gauge zero mode is the diagonal
component of the fermion zero mode. An analysis of the vacuum structure is
provided and it is shown that the inclusion of zero modes is crucial for
probing the phase properties of the vacua. In particular, we find that the
ground state energy is zero and N-fold degenerate, and thus consistent with
unbroken supersymmetry. We also show that the inclusion of zero modes for the
light-cone supercharges leaves the supersymmetry algebra unchanged. Finally, we
remark that the dependence of the light-cone Fock vacuum in terms of the gauge
zero is unchanged in the presence of matter fields.
