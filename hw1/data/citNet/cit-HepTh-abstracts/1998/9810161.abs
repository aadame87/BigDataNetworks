  We report on the status of the string-inspired world line path integral
formalism, a recently developed powerful tool for the reorganisation of
standard perturbative amplitudes in quantum field theory. The method is
outlined and the present range of its applicability surveyed. The emphasis is
on QED and QCD photon/gluon amplitudes, with a short discussion of axial
couplings.
