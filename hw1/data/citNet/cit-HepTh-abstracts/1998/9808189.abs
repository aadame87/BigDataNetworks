  Static color charges in Yang-Mills theory are considered in the Schr\"odinger
picture. Stationary states containing color sources, interquark potential and
confinement criterion are discussed within the framework based on integration
over gauge transformations which projects the vacuum wave functional on the
space of physical, gauge-invariant states.
