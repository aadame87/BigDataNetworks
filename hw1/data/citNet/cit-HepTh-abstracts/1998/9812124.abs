  The short survey of computation and properties of effective Lagrange function
of intensive field in two-loop approximation accounting for radiative
interaction of virtual electrons is given. The renormalization of field, charge
and mass is completely defined by the weak field behaviour of the exact
Lagrange function: its real part must be Maxwellian and imaginary part must be
quasiclassical $\propto \exp (-\pi m^2c^3/\hbar e\epsilon)$. For weak electric
field radiative interaction manifests itself as electron mass shift. Using the
renorminvariance at strong field and exponentiation at weak field it is
possible to obtain information about contributions of high order in $\alpha$.
