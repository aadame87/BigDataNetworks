  We have constructed a four-fermion theory coupled to a
Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge field which admits static multi-vortex solutions.
This is achieved through the introduction of an anomalous magnetic interation
term in addition to the usual minimal coupling, and the appropriate choice of
the fermion quartic coupling constant.
