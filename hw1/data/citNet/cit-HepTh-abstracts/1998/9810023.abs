  We investigate BPS properties of the charged soliton solutions of D-brane
worldvolume theory, which is described by the supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld
action, by means of the N=2 target-space supersymmetry algebra. Our results
agree with those obtained previously. We also extend our BPS analysis to the
case where axion background exists.
