Title: SU(2) -- Monopole: Interbasis Expansion

  This article deals with a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical study of a
charge-dyon system with the SU(2)--monopole in five dimensions. The
Schr\"odinger equation for this system is separable in the hyperspherical and
parabolic coordinates. The problem of interbasis expansion of the wave
functions is completely solved. The coefficients for the expansion of the
parabolic basis in terms of the hyperspherical basis can be expressed through
the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the group SU(2).
