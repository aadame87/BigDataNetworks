  The N=1 superspace generalization of the 3-brane action in 6 dimensions with
partially broken N=2 supersymmetry can be constructed using N=1 chiral, complex
linear, or real linear superfields. The physical scalars of these multiplets
give equivalent descriptions of the two transverse coordinates. The second
supersymmetry is realized nonlinearly in all these actions. We derive the
superspace brane actions and their nonlinear supersymmetry for both kinds of
linear superfields when we break N=2 supersymmetry spontaneously. This breaking
is realized in the free action of hypermultiplets that live in N=2 projective
superspace by constraining the N=2 multiplets to reduce them to a pure
Goldstone multiplet. For the chiral superfield, the superspace brane action and
nonlinear supersymmetry can be deduced by dualizing the brane action of either
linear superfield. We find that the dual action is unique up to field
redefinitions that introduce arbitrariness in the dependence on the auxiliary
fields.
