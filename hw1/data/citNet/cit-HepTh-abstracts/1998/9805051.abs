  A wide class of Seiberg-Witten models constructed by M-theory techniques and
described by non-hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces are shown to possess an
associative algebra of holomorphic differentials. This is a first step towards
proving that also these models satisfy the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde
equation. In this way, similar results known for simpler Seiberg-Witten models
(described by hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces and constructed without recourse
to M-theory) are extended to certain non-hyperelliptic cases constructed in
M-theory. Our analysis reveals a connection between the algebra of holomorphic
differentials on the Riemann surface and the configuration of M-theory branes
of the corresponding Seiberg-Witten model.
