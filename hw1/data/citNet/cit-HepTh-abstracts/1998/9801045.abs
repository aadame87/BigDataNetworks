Title: Superconnections and Matter

  In a previous paper (hep-th/9801040), the superconnection formalism was used
to fit the Higgs field into a U(n) gauge theory with particular emphasis on the
n=2 case, aiming at the reconstruction of certain parts of the Standard Model.
The approach provides an alternative to the one bases on non-commutative
geometry. This work is continued by including matter fields (leptons only). We
extend the Standard Model by including the right-handed neutrino field. The
possibility of a finite neutrino mass is thus accounted for.
