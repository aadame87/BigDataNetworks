Title: On the Relation between Wilson Action and CJT Effective Action
Authors: Giovanni Amelino-Camelia and Jean-Pierre Derendinger
Comments: 4 pages, LaTex. To appear in the proceedings of the {6-th
  International Conference on Path Integrals from peV to TeV
Report-no: NEIP-98-016
\\
  A relation between Wilson action and the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective
action, which was recently suggested by Periwal, is here derived using
path-integral techniques.
