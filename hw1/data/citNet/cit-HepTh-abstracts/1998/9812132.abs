  We calculate by the method of dimensional regularization and derivative
expansion the one-loop effective action for a Dirac fermion with a
Lorentz-violating and CPT-odd kinetic term in the background of a gauge field.
We show that this term induces a Chern-Simons modification to Maxwell theory.
Some related issues are also discussed.
