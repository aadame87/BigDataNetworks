  We compute the influence of boundary conditions on the Euler-Heisenberg
effective Lagrangian scalar QED scalar for the case of a pure magnetic field.
The boundary conditions constrain the quantum scalar field to vanish on two
parallel planes separeted by a distance $a$ and the magnetic field is assumed
to be constant, uniform and perpendicular to the planes. The effective
Lagrangian is obtained using Schwinger's proper-time representation and
exhibits new contributions generated by the boundary condition much in the same
way as a material pressed between two plates exhibits new magnetic properties.
The confined bosonic vacuum presents the expected diamagnetic properties and
besides the new non-linear $a$-dependent contributions to the susceptibility we
show that there exists also a new $a$-dependent contribution for the vacuum
permeability in the linear approximation.
