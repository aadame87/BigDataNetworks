  In the (non-supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory in the large N limit there
exists an infinite set of non-degenerate vacua. The distinct vacua are
separated by domain walls whose tension determines the decay rate of the false
vacua. I discuss the phenomenon from a field-theoretic point of view, starting
from supersymmetric gluodynamics and then breaking supersymmetry, by
introducing a gluino mass. By combining previously known results, the decay
rate of the excited vacua is estimated, \Gamma \sim \exp (-const \times N^4).
The fourth power of N in the exponent is a consequence of the fact that the
wall tension is proportional to N.
