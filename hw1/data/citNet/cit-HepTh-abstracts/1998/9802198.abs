  A large class of extremal and near-extremal four dimensional black holes in
M-theory feature near horizon geometries that contain three dimensional
asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces. Globally, these geometries are derived
from AdS_3 by discrete identifications. The microstates of such black holes can
be counted by exploiting the conformal symmetry induced on the anti-de Sitter
boundary, and the result agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. This
approach, pioneered by Strominger, clarifies the physical nature of the black
hole microstates. It also suggests that recent analyses of the relationship
between boundary conformal field theory and supergravity can be extended to
orbifolds of AdS spaces.
