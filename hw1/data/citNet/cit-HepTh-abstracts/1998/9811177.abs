Title: Brane Dynamics and Four-Dimensional Quantum Field Theory
Authors: N.D. Lambert and P.C. West
Comments: 10 pages, sprocl.sty. To appear in the proceedings of the Trieste
  Conference on Superfivebranes and Physics in 5+1 Dimensions, April 1998
Report-no: KCL-TH-98-57
\\
  We review the relation between the classical dynamics of the M-fivebrane and
the quantum low energy effective action for N=2 Yang-Mills theories. We also
discuss some outstanding issues in this correspondence.
