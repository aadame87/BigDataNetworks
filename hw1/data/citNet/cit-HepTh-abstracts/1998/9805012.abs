  We show that the instability of the singular Vilenkin instanton describing
the creation of an open universe can be avoided using, instead of a minimally
coupled scalar field, an axionic massless scalar field which gives rise to the
Giddings-Strominger instanton. However, if we replace the singularity of the
Hawking Turok instanton for an axionic wormhole some interpretational and
technical difficulties would appear which can be overcome by introducing a
positive cosmological constant in the action. This would make the instanton
finite and free constant in the action. This would make the instanton finite
and free from any instabilities.
