  We compute the effective action for scattering of three well-separated
extremal brane solutions, in 11d supergravity, with zero p_ transfer and small
transverse velocities. Using an interpretation of the conjecture of Maldacena,
following Hyun, this can be viewed as the large N limit of the Matrix theory
description of three supergraviton scattering at leading order. The result is
consistent with the perturbative supergravity calculation.
