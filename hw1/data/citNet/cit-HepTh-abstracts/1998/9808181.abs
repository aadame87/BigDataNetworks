  In this note we extend our work in a previous paper hep-th/9801038. We show
here that various intersecting brane-like configurations can be found in the
vacuum of $D=4, N=4$ supergravity with gauged R-symmetry group $SU(2)\times
SU(2)$. These include intersections of domain-walls, strings and point-like
objects. Some of these intersecting configurations preserve 1/2 and 1/4 of
supersymmetry. We observe that the previously obtained $AdS_3\times R^1$ pure
axionic vacuum or `axio-vac' is an intersection of domain-wall with extended
string with 1/2 supersymmetries. Also the solutions known as `electro-vac' with
geometry $AdS_2\times R^2$ can be simply interpreted as the intersection of
domain-wall with point-like object.
