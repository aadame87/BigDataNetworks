  A thought experiment is formulated to unify quantum mechanics and general
relativity in a topological manner. An analysis of the interactions in Nature
is then presented. The universal ground state of the constructed theory derives
from the cyclic properties ($S^1$ homotopy) of the topological manifold
$Q=2T^3\oplus 3S^1\times S^2$ which has 23 intrinsic degrees of freedom,
discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\times Z_3$ internal groups, an SU(5) or SO(10) gauge
group, and leads to an anomalous U(1) symmetry on a lattice. These properties
can in principle reproduce the standard model with a stable proton. The general
equation of motion for the unified theory is derived up to the Planck energy
and leads to a Higgs field with possible inflation. The thermodynamic
properties of $Q$ are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmic
microwave background fluctuations. The manifold $Q$ possesses internal energy
scales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but which
constrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular the
electron and its neutrino are identified as particle ground states and their
masses are predicted. The mass of the electron agrees very well with
observations. A heuristic argument for the occurrence and magnitude of CP
violation is given. Future extensions of the presented framework are discussed.
