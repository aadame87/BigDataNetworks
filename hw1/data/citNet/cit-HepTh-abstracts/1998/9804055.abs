Title: Green-Schwarz type formulation of D=11 S - invariant superstring and
  superparticle actions
Authors: A.A. Deriglazov and D.M. Gitman
Comments: Revised version, in particular, discussion of SO(2,9) case is
  included. To be published in Int. J. Mod. Phys. A
\\
  A manifestly Poincare invariant formulations for $SO(1,10)$ and SO(2,9)
superstring actions are proposed. The actions are invariant under a local
fermionic $\kappa$-symmetry as well as under a number of global symmetries,
which turn out to be on-shell realization of the known ``new supersymmetry``
S-algebra. Canonical quantization of the theory is performed and relation of
the quantum state spectrum with that of type IIA Green-Schwarz superstring is
discussed. Besides, a mechanical model is constructed, which is a zero tension
limit of the D=11 superstring and which incorporates all essential features of
the latter. A corresponding action invariant under off-shell closed realization
of the S-algebra is obtained.
