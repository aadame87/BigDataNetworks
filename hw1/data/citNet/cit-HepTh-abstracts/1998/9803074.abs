Title: Magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking and the Pauli problem
Author: Y. Jack Ng
Comments: 7 pages, Tex; to appear in the Proceedings of the Conference on
  Quantum Aspects of Beam Physics, held at Monterey, California in January 1998

  The non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson equation is used to show that chiral
symmetry is dynamically broken in QED at weak gauge couplings when an external
uniform magnetic field is present. A complete analysis of this phenomenon may
shed light on the Pauli problem, namely, why $\alpha$ = 1/137.
