  For each lattice one can define a free boson theory propagating on the
corresponding torus. We give an alternative definition where one employs any
automorphism of the group $M^*/M$. This gives a wealth of conformal data, which
we realize as some bosonic theory, in all the `regular' cases. We discuss the
generalization to affine theories. As a byproduct, we compute the gauss sum for
any lattice and any diagonal automorphism.
