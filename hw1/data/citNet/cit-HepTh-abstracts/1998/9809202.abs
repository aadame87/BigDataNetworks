  In the framework of special Kahler geometry we consider the
supergravity-matter system which emerges on a K3-fibered Calabi-Yau manifold.
By applying the rigid limit procedure in the vicinity of a conifold singularity
we compute the Kahler potential of the scalars and the kinetic matrix of the
vectors to first order in the gravitational coupling.
