  We consider the quantum sinh-Gordon model in this paper. Using known formulae
for form factors we sum up all their contributions and obtain a closed
expression for a correlation function. This expression is a determinant of an
integral operator. Similar determinant representations were proven to be useful
not only in the theory of correlation functions, but also in the matrix models.
