  We demonstrate the equality between the universal chiral partition function,
which was first found in the context of conformal field theory and
Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and the exclusion statistics introduced by Haldane
in the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect. The phenomena of multiple
representations of the same conformal field theory by different sets of
exclusion statistics is discussed in the context of the ${\hat u}(1)$ theory of
a compactified boson of radius $R.$
