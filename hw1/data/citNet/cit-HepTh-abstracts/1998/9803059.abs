  Coupled to Scalar Matter
Authors: A.T. Filippov, V.G. Ivanov
Comments: LaTeX, 8 pages, no figures. Talk given at the VIII International
  Conference on Symmetry Methods in Physics (Dubna 1997), to be published at
  Phys. of At. Nucl. 1998, vol. 61, #10

  Integrable models of 1+1 dimensional gravity coupled to scalar and vector
fields are briefly reviewed. A new class of integrable models with nonminimal
coupling to scalar fields is constructed and discussed.
