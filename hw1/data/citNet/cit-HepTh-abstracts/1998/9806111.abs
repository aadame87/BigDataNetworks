  We discuss the problem of time in spherically symmetric pure Einstein gravity
with the cosmological term by using an exact solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation. A positive definite inner product is defined, based on the momentum
constraint rather than the hamiltonian constraint. A natural notion of time is
introduced via the Heisenberg equation. This notion enables one to reproduce
the time-time component of the classical metric. Non-Hermiticity of the
hamiltonian is essential in the definition of time.
