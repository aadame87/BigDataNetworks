  We derive a dual theory of the four-dimensional anomalous U(1) gauge theory
with a Wess--Zumino (WZ) term and with a St\"uckelberg type mass term by means
of a duality transformation at each of the classical and quantum levels. It is
shown that in the dual anomalous U(1) gauge theory, the $BF$ term with a
rank-two antisymmetric tensor field plays the roles of the WZ term as well as
the mass term of the U(1) gauge field. Similar anomalous U(1) gauge theory with
$BF$ term is considered in six-dimensions by introducing a rank-four
antisymmetric tensor field. In addition to this theory, we propose a
six-dimensional anomalous U(1) gauge theory including an extended $BF$ term
with a rank-two antisymmetric tensor field, discussing a difference between the
two theories. We also consider a four-dimensional anomalous SU(2)$\times$U(1)
gauge theory with $BF$ term and recognize a crucial role of the $BF$ term in
cancelling the non-abelian chiral anomaly.
