  It is outlined how deformations of field theoretical rigid symmetries can be
constructed and classified by cohomological means in the extended antifield
formalism. Special attention is devoted to deformations referring only to a
subset of the rigid symmetries of a given model and leading to a nontrivial
extension of the graded Lie algebra associated with that subset. The method is
illustrated for a D=4, N=2 supersymmetric model where the central extension of
the supersymmetry algebra emerges via a deformation. Deformations of gauge
fixed actions with a BRST symmetry are discussed too and illustrated by the
Curci-Ferrari model.
