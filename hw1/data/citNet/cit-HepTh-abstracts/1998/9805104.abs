  We compute, in the large N limit, the quark potential for ${\cal N}=4$
supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory broken to $SU(N_1) \times SU(N_2)$. At
short distances the quarks see only the unbroken gauge symmetry and have an
attractive potential that falls off as 1/L. At longer distances the interquark
interaction is sensitive to the symmetry breaking, and other QCD states appear.
These states correspond to combinations of the quark-antiquark pair with some
number of W-particles. If there is one or more W-particles then this state is
unstable because of the coulomb interaction between the W-particles and between
the W's and the quarks. As L is decreased the W-particles delocalize and these
coulomb branches merge onto a branch with a linear potential. The quarks on
this branch see the unbroken gauge group, but the flux tube is unstable to the
production of W-particles.
