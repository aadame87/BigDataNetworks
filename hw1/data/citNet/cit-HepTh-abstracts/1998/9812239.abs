  The leading terms in the long-range interaction potential between an
arbitrary pair of matrix theory objects are calculated at one-loop order. This
result generalizes previous calculations by including arbitrary fermionic
background field configurations. The interaction potential at orders 1/r^7 and
1/r^8 is shown to correspond precisely with the leading terms expected from
linearized supergravity interactions between arbitrary objects in M-theory.
General expressions for the stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current
of an arbitrary matrix configuration are derived, including fermionic
contributions. Supergravity effects which are correctly reproduced include
membrane/5-brane interactions, 0-brane/6-brane interactions,
supercurrent/supercurrent interactions and the spin contributions to moments of
the supergravity currents. The matrix theory description of the supergravity
stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current are used to propose an
explicit formulation of matrix theory in an arbitrary background metric and
3-form field.
