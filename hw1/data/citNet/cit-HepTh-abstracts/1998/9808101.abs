  We construct vacua of M-theory on S^1/Z_2 associated with Calabi-Yau
three-folds. These vacua are appropriate for compactification to N=1
supersymmetry theories in both four and five dimensions. We allow for general
E_8 x E_8 gauge bundles and for the presence of five-branes. The five-branes
span the four-dimensional uncompactified space and are wrapped on holomorphic
curves in the Calabi-Yau space. Properties of these vacua, as well as of the
resulting low-energy theories, are discussed. We find that the low-energy gauge
group is enlarged by gauge fields that originate on the five-brane
world-volumes. In addition, the five-branes increase the types of new E_8 x E_8
breaking patterns allowed by the non-standard embedding. Characteristic
features of the low-energy theory, such as the threshold corrections to the
gauge kinetic functions, are significantly modified due to the presence of the
five-branes, as compared to the case of standard or non-standard embeddings
without five-branes.
