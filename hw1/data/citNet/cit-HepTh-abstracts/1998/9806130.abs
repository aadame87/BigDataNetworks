  We consider g coincident M-5-branes on top of each other, in the KK monopole
background Q of multiplicity N. The worldvolume of each M-5-brane is supposed
to be given by the local product of the four-dimensional spacetime and an
elliptic curve. In the coincidence limit, all these curves yield a single
(Seiberg-Witten) hyperelliptic curve, while the gauge symmetry is enhanced to
U(N). We make this gauge symmetry enhancement manifest by considering the
hypermultiplet LEEA which is given by the spacetime N=2 non-linear sigma-model
(NLSM) having Q as the target space. The hyper-K"ahler manifold Q is given by
the multicentre Taub-NUT space, which in the coincidence limit amounts to the
multiple Eguchi-Hanson (ALE) space Q. The NLSM is most naturally described in
terms of the hyper-K"ahler coset construction on SU(N,N)/U(N) in harmonic
superspace, by using the auxiliary (in classical theory) N=2 vector superfields
as Lagrange multipliers, with FI terms resolving the singularity. The Maldacena
limit, in which the hypermultiplet LEEA becomes extended to the N=4 SYM with
the gauge group U(N), arises in quantum field theory due to a dynamical
generation of the N=2 vector and hypermultipet superfields, when sending the FI
terms to zero.
