  A free spinor field on a noncommutative sphere is described starting from a
canonical realization of the enveloping algebra U(u(2|1)). The gauge extension
of the model - the Schwinger model on a noncommutative sphere is defined and
the model is quantized. The model contains only finite number degrees of
freedom and is nonperturbatively UV-regular. The chiral anomaly and the
effective actions are calculated. In the nomcommutative limit standard formulas
are recovered.
