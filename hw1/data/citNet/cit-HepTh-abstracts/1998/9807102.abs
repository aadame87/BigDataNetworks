Title: Algebraic Renormalization of the Electroweak Standard Model
Authors: Elisabeth Kraus (Univ. Bonn)
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX, Talk presented at the DESY Zeuthen Workshop on
  Elementary Particle Theory ``Loops and Legs in Gauge Theories'', Rheinsberg,
  Germany, April 19-24, 1998, to appear in Acta Phys. Pol
Report-no: Bonn-TH-98-15

\\
  The algebraic method of renormalization is applied to the standard model of
electroweak interactions. We present the most important modifications compared
to theories with simple groups.
