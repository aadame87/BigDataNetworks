  We study the self-duality of Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons theory which can be
interpreted as a massive D2 brane in IIA string theory and exhibit the
self-dual formulation in terms of the gauge invariant master Lagrangian. The
proposed master Lagrangian contains the nonlocal auxiliary field and approaches
self-dual formulation of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in a point-particle limit
with the weak string-coupling limit. The consistent canonical brackets of dual
system are derived.
