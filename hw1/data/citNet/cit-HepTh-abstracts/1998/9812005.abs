  We study the propagation of gauge fields with arbitrary integer spins in the
symmetrical Einstein space of any dimensionality. We reduce the problem of
obtaining a gauge-invariant Lagrangian of integer spin fields in such
background to an purely algebraic problem of finding a set of operators with
certain features using the representation of high-spin fields in the form of
some vectors of pseudo-Hilbert space. We consider such construction in the
linear order in the Riemann tensor and scalar curvature and also present an
explicit form of interaction Lagrangians and gauge transformations for massive
particles with spins 1 and 2 in terms of symmetrical tensor fields.
