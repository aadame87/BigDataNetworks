  The transition amplitude is obtained for a free massive particle of arbitrary
spin by calculating the path integral in the index-spinor formulation within
the BFV-BRST approach. None renormalizations of the path integral measure were
applied. The calculation has given the Weinberg propagator written in the
index-free form with the use of index spinor. The choice of boundary conditions
on the index spinor determines holomorphic or antiholomorphic representation
for the canonical description of particle/antiparticle spin.
