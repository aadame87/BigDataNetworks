  We use the M theory approach in the presence of an orientifold O6 plane to
understand some aspects of the moduli space of vacua for N=1 supersymmetric
$SO(N_c)/Sp(N_c)$ gauge theories in four dimensions. By exploiting some general
properties of the O6 orientifold, we reproduce some results obtained previously
with an orientifold O4 plane when the flavor group arises from the worldvolume
dynamics of D6 branes. By using semi-infinite D4 branes instead of D6 branes,
we derive the most general form of the rotated curve describing the moduli
space of vacua for N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with massive matter.
