  For massive and conformal quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions with a
global gauge group we consider soliton automorphisms, viz. automorphisms of the
quasilocal algebra which act like two different global symmetry transformations
on the left and right spacelike complements of a bounded region. We give a
unified treatment by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence and Poincare' covariance of soliton automorphisms which is applicable
to a large class of theories. In particular, our construction applies to the
QFT models with the local Fock property -- in which case the latter property is
the only input from constructive QFT we need -- and to holomorphic conformal
field theories. In conformal QFT soliton representations appear as twisted
sectors, and in a subsequent paper our results will be used to give a rigorous
analysis of the superselection structure of orbifolds of holomorphic theories.
