  The complete spectrum of D=6, N=4b supergravity with n tensor multiplets
compactified on AdS_3 x S^3 is determined. The D=6 theory obtained from the K_3
compactification of Type IIB string requires that n=21, but we let n be
arbitrary. The superalgebra that underlies the symmetry of the resulting
supergravity theory in AdS_3 coupled to matter is SU(1,1|2)_L x SU(1,1|2)_R.
The theory also has an unbroken global SO(4)_R x SO(n) symmetry inherited from
D=6. The spectrum of states arranges itself into a tower of spin-2
supermultiplets, a tower of spin-1, SO(n) singlet supermultiplets, a tower of
spin-1 supermultiplets in the vector representation of SO(n) and a special
spin-1/2 supermultiplet also in the vector representation of SO(n). The SU(2)_L
x SU(2)_R Yang-Mills states reside in the second level of the spin-2 tower and
the lowest level of the spin-1, SO(n) singlet tower and the associated field
theory exhibits interesting properties.
