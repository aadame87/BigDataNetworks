  By making use of the path integral duality transformation, we derive the
string representation for the partition function of an extended Dual Abelian
Higgs Model containing gauge fields of external currents of electrically
charged particles. By the same method, we obtain the corresponding
representations for the generating functionals of gauge field and monopole
current correlators. In the case of bilocal correlators, the obtained results
are found to be in agreement with the dual Meissner scenario of confinement and
with the Stochastic Model of the QCD vacuum.
