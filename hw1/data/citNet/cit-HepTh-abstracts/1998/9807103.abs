Title: On Finite Size Effects in $d=2$ Quantum Gravity

  A systematic investigation is given of finite size effects in $d=2$ quantum
gravity or equivalently the theory of dynamically triangulated random
surfaces. For Ising models coupled to random surfaces, finite size effects are
studied on the one hand by numerical generation of the partition function to
arbitrary accuracy by a deterministic calculus, and on the other hand by an
analytic theory based on the singularity analysis of the explicit parametric
form of the free energy of the corresponding matrix model. Both these reveal
that the form of the finite size corrections, not surprisingly, depend on the
string susceptibility. For the general case where the parametric form of the
matrix model free energy is not explicitly known, it is shown how to perform
the singularity analysis. All these considerations also apply to other
observables like susceptibility etc. In the case of the Ising model it is shown
that the standard Fisher-scaling laws are reproduced.
