  The derivation of the explicit formula for the vacuum expectation value of
the Wilson loop functional for an arbitrary gauge group on an arbitrary
orientable two-dimensional manifold is considered both in the continuum case
and on the lattice. A contribution to this quantity, coming from the space of
invariant connections, is also analyzed and is shown to be similar to the
contribution of monopoles.
