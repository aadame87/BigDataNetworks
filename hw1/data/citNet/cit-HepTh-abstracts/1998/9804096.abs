  We provide the first example of a cosmological solution of the Horava-Witten
supergravity. This solution is obtained by exchanging the role of time with the
radial coordinate of the transverse space to the five-brane soliton. On the
boundary this corresponds to rotating an instanton solution into a tunneling
process in a space with Lorentzian signature, leading to an expanding universe.
Due to the freedom to choose different non-trivial Yang-Mills backgrounds on
the boundaries, the two walls of the universe ( visible and hidden worlds)
expand differently. However at late times the anisotropy is washed away by
gravitational interactions.
