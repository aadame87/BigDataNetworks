  General solution of the non-abelian Gauss law in terms of covariant curls and
gradients is presented. Also two non-abelian analogs of the Hodge decomposition
in three dimensions are addressed. i) Decomposition of an isotriplet vector
field $V_{i}^{a}(x)$ as sum of covariant curl and gradient with respect to an
arbitrary background Yang-Mills potential is obtained. ii) A decomposition of
the form $V_{i}^{a}=B_{i}^{a}(C)+D_{i}(C) \phi^{a} $ which involves non-abelian
magnetic field of a new Yang-Mills potential C is also presented. These results
are relevant for duality transformation for non-abelian gauge fields.
