  We study curved space versions of matrix string theory taking as a definition
of the theory a gauged matrix sigma model. By analyzing the divergent terms in
the loop expansion for the effective action we reduce the problem to a simple
matrix generalization of the standard string theory beta function calculation.
It is then demonstrated that the model can only be consistent for Ricci flat
manifolds with vanishing six-dimensional Euler density.
