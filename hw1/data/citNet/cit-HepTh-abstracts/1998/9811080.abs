  We consider the 5-brane placed at one end of the world in the Heterotic $E_8
\times E_8$ theory. The low energy theory is a 6 dimensional $(1,0)$
superconformal theory with $E_8$ as a global symmetry. We calculate the
two-point correlator of the $E_8$ current in 6 dimensions and in 4 dimensions
after compactification on $\MT{2}$. This correlator is derived in 3 different
ways: From field theory, from 11 dimensional supergravity and from F-theory.
