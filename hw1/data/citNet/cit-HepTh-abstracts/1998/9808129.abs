  It has been suggested recently that knots might exist as stable soliton
solutions in a simple three-dimensional classical field theory, opening up a
wide range of possible applications in physics and beyond. We have re-examined
and extended this work in some detail using a combination of analytic
approximations and sophisticated numerical algorithms. For charges between one
and eight, we find solutions which exhibit a rich and spectacular variety of
phenomena, including stable toroidal solitons with twists, linked loops and
also knots. The physical process which allows for this variety is the
reconnection of string-like segments.
