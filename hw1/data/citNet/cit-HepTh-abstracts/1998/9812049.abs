  We study the attractor mechanism in low energy effective D=4, N=2 Yang-Mills
theory weakly coupled to gravity, obtained from the effective action of type
IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. Using special
K\"{a}hler geometry, the general form of the leading gravitational correction
is derived, and from this the attractor equations in the weak gravity limit.
The effective Newton constant turns out to be spacetime-dependent due to QFT
loop and nonperturbative effects. We discuss some properties of the attractor
solutions, which are gravitationally corrected dyons, and their relation with
the BPS spectrum of quantum Yang-Mills theory. Along the way, we obtain a
satisfying description of Strominger's massless black holes, moving at the
speed of light, free of pathologies encountered in some earlier proposals.
