  We show that discrete torsion is implemented in a D-brane world-volume theory
by using a projective representation of the orbifold point group. We study the
example of C^3/Z_2 x Z_2 and show that the resolution of singularities agrees
with that proposed by Vafa and Witten. A new type of fractional brane appears.
