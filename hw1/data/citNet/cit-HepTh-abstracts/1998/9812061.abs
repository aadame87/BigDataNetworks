  We discuss aspects of the heterotic string effective field theories in
orbifold constructions of the heterotic string. We calculate the moduli
dependence of threshold corrections to gauge couplings in (2,2) symmetric
orbifold compactifications. We perform the calculation of the threshold
corrections for a particular class of abelian (2,2) symmetric non-decomposable
orbifold models... internal twist is realized as generalized Coxeter
automorphism. We define the limits for the existence of states causing
singularities in the moduli space in the perturbative regime for a generic
vacuum of the heterotic string. The 'proof' provides evidence for the
explanation of the stringy 'Higgs effect'. Furthermore, we calculate the moduli
dependence of threshold corrections as target space invariant free energies for
non-decomposable orbifolds, identifying the Hauptmodul' functions for the
relevant congruence subgroups. The required solutions provide for the \mu mass
term generation in the effective low energy theory and affect the induced
sypersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation. In addition, we discuss the one
loop gauge and gravitational couplings in (0,2) non-decomposable orbifold
compactifications. In the second part of the Thesis the one loop correction to
the Kahler metric for a generic N=2 orbifold compactification of the heterotic
string is calculated... In this way, with the use of the one loop string
amplitudes, the prepotential of the vector multiplets of the N=2 effective
low-energy heterotic string is calculated in decomposable toroidal
compactifications of the heterotic string ... This method provides the solution
for the one loop correction to the prepotential of the vector multiplets of the
heterotic string compactified on the K_3 \times T^2...
