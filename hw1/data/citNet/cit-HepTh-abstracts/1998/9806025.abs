  A serious problem with the Schwinger-Dyson approach to dynamical mass
generation in QED3 at finite temperature is that the contribution from the
transverse part of the photon propagator, in the Landau gauge, leads to
infrared divergences in both the mass function and the wavefunction
renormalisation. We show how, by using a simple choice of vertex anatz and a
choice of non-local gauge (the `D-gauge') both quantities can be made finite.
We formulate an equation for the physical mass M. and show that it reduces to
the coresponding equation obtained in the constant physical mass approximation
M=M(0,pi T) (which is finite). There for at finite temperature, we are able to
justify a `constant' mass approximation for M, and show that the value of r
(the ratio of twice the physical mass at zero temperature to the critical
temperature) remains close to the value obtained in previous calculations with
retardation.
