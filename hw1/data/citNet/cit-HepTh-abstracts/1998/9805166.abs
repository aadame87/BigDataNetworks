  The magnetic monopole condensate is calculated in the dual Monopole
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with dual Dirac strings suggested in Refs.[1,2] as a
functional of the dual Dirac string shape. The calculation is carried out in
the tree approximation in the scalar monopole-antimonopole collective
excitation field. The integration over quantum fluctuations of the dual-vector
monopole-antimonopole collective excitation field around the Abrikosov flux
line and string shape fluctuations are performed explicitly. We claim that
there are important contributions of quantum and string shape fluctuations to
the magnetic monopole condensate.
