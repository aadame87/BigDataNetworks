  After a brief review of matrix theory compactification leading to
noncommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theory, we present solutions for
the fundamental and adjoint sections on a two-dimensional twisted quantum torus
in two different gauges. We also give explicit transformations connecting
different representations which have appeared in the literature. Finally we
discuss the more mathematical concept of Morita equivalence of C*-algebras as
it applies to our specific case.
