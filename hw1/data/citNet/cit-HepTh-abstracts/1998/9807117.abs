  In a recent paper DeWolfe et al. have shown how to use the self-intersection
number of junctions to constrain the BPS spectrum of N=2, D=4 theories with ADE
flavor symmetry arising on a single D3-brane probe in a 7-brane background.
Motivated by the existence of more general N=2, D=4 theories arising on the
worldvolume of multiple D3-brane probes we show how to compute the
self-intersection number of junctions in the presence of 7-branes and multiple
D3-branes.
