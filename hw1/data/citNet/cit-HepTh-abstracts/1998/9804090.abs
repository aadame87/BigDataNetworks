  A. Ghosh and P. Mitra made the proposal how to explain the area law for the
entropy of extreme black holes in some model calculations. I argue that their
approach implicitly operates with strongly singular geometries and says nothing
about the contribution of regular metrics of extreme black holes into the
partition function.
