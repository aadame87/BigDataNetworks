  We present a new approximation technique for quantum field theory. The
standard one-loop result is used as a seed for a recursive formula that gives a
sequence of improved Gaussian approximations for the generating functional. In
a different setting, the basic idea of this recursive scheme is used in the
second part of the paper to substantialy speed up the standard Monte Carlo
algorithm.
