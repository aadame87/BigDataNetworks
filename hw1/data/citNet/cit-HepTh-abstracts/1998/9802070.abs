  With the third order Monge-Amp\`ere equation as an example, we show that
there exists an infinite number of nonlocal conserved charges associated with
the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations. A general prescription for
the construction of these charges is given and the charge algebra is calculated
bringing out various other interesting features associated with such systems.
