  Using a group-invariant version of the Faddeev-Popov method we explicitly
obtain the partition functions of the Self-Dual Model and Maxwell-Chern-Simons
theory. We show that their ratio coincides with the partition function of
abelian Chern-Simons theory to within a phase factor depending on the
geometrical properties of the manifold.
