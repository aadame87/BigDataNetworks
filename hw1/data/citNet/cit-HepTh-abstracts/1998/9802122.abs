  This paper deals with classical solutions of the modified chiral model on
$R^{2+1}$. Such solutions are shown to correspond to products of various factor
which we call time-dependent unitons. Then the problem of solving the system of
second-order partial differential equations for the chiral field is reduced to
solving a sequence of systems of first-order partial differential equations for
the unitons.
