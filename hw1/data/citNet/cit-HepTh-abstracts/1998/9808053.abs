  By considering N=2 string amplitudes we determine the (2+2)-dimensional
target space action for the physical degrees of freedom: self-dual gravity and
self-dual Yang-Mills, together with their respective infinite towers of
higher-spin inequivalent picture states. Novel `stringy' couplings amongst
these fields are essential ingredients of an action principle for the effective
target space field theory. We discuss the covariant description of this theory
in terms of self-dual fields on a hyperspace parametrised by the target space
coordinate and a commuting chiral spinor.
