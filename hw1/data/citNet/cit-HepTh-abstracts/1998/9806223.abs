Title: Equivalence of Hawking and Unruh Temperatures and Entropies Through Flat
  Space Embeddings
Authors: S. Deser and Orit Levin
Comments: An expanded version of our initial submission: addition of entropy
  derivations to complement those of temperature in the original

  We present a unified description of temperature and entropy in spaces with
either "true" or "accelerated observer" horizons: In their (higher dimensional)
global embedding Minkowski geometries, the relevant detectors have constant
accelerations a_{G}; associated with their Rindler horizons are temperature
a_{G}/2\pi and entropy equal to 1/4 the horizon area. Both quantities agree
with those calculated in the original curved spaces.
  As one example of this equivalence, we obtain the temperature and entropy of
Schwarzschild geometry from its flat D=6 embedding.
