  It is shown that when the underlying sigma model of bosonic string theory is
written in terms of single-valued fields, which live in the covering space of
the target space, Abelian T-duality survives lattice regularization of the
world-sheet. The projection onto the target-space is implemented through a sum
over cohomology, which bears resemblance to summing over topological sectors in
Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the case of string theory on a circle is
shown to be explicitly self-dual in the lattice regulated model and
automatically forbids vortex excitations which would otherwise destroy the
duality. For other target spaces a generalized notion of T-duality is observed
in which the target space and the cohomology coefficient group are interchanged
under duality. Specific examples show that the fundamental group of the target
space may not be preserved in the T-dual theory. Generalized models which
exhibit T-duality behaviour, with dynamical variables that live on the
k-dimensional cells of (p+1)-dimensional world-volumes, are also constructed.
These models correspond to gauge theories, and higher-dimensional analogues, in
which one sums over various topological sectors of the theory.
