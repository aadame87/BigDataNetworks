  The fermion propagator and the 4-fermion Green function in the massless QED2
are explicitly found with topological effects taken into account. The
corrections due to instanton sectors k=+1,-1, contributing to the propagator,
are shown to be just the homogenous terms admitted by the Dyson-Schwinger
equation for S. In the case of the 4-fermion function also sectors k=+2,-2 are
included into consideration. The quark condensates are then calculated and are
shown to satisfy cluster property. The theta-dependence exhibited by the Green
functions corresponds to and may be removed by performing certain chiral gauge
transformation.
