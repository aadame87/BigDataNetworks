  In the given work we study an interaction of second massive state of an open
boson string with the constant electromagnetic field. This state contains
massive fields with spins 3 and 1. Using the method of an open string BRST
quantization, we receive gauge-invariant lagrangian, describing the
electromagnetic interaction of these fields. From the explicit view of
transformations and lagrangian it follows that the presence of external
constant e/m field leads to the mixing of the given level states. Most likely
that the presence of the external field will lead to the mixing of the states
at other mass string levels as well.
