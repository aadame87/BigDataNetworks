  We discuss the relation between string quantization based on the Schild path
integral and the Nambu-Goto path integral. The equivalence between the two
approaches at the classical level is extended to the quantum level by a
saddle--point evaluation of the corresponding path integrals. A possible
relationship between M-Theory and the quantum mechanics of string loops is
pointed out. Then, within the framework of ``loop quantum mechanics'', we
confront the difficult question as to what exactly gives rise to the structure
of spacetime. We argue that the large scale properties of the string condensate
are responsible for the effective Riemannian geometry of classical spacetime.
On the other hand, near the Planck scale the condensate ``evaporates'', and
what is left behind is a ``vacuum'' characterized by an effective fractal
geometry.
