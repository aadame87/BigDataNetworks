  To avoid the problems which are connected with the long distance behavior of
perturbative gauge theories we present a local construction of the observables
which does not involve the adiabatic limit. First we construct the interacting
fields as formal power series by means of causal perturbation theory. The
observables are defined by BRST invariance where the BRST-transformation
$\tilde s$ acts as a graded derivation on the algebra of interacting fields.
Positivity, i.e. the existence of Hilbert space representations of the local
algebras of observables is shown with the help of a local Kugo-Ojima operator
$Q_{\rm int}$ which implements $\tilde s$ on a local algebra and differs from
the corresponding operator $Q$ of the free theory. We prove that the Hilbert
space structure present in the free case is stable under perturbations. All
assumptions are shown to be satisfied in QED in a finite spatial volume with
suitable boundary conditions. As a by-product we find that the
BRST-quantization is not compatible with periodic boundary conditions for
massless free gauge fields.
