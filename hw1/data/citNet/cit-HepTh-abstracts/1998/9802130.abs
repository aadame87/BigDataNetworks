Title: Prepotentials and Riemann surfaces
Author: Robert Carroll (Mathematics Dept., University of Illinois, Urbana, IL)
Comments: Latex, 26 pages. Some typos are corrected and a number of
  improvements are added
\\
  We organize and review some material from various sources about
prepotentials, Riemann surfaces and kernels, WDVV, and the renormalization
group, provide some further connections and information, and indicate some
directions and problems.
