  We describe in superspace a classical theory of two dimensional $(1,1)$
dilaton supergravity with a cosmological constant, both with and without
coupling to a massive superparticle. We give general exact non-trivial
superspace solutions for the compensator superfield that describes the
supergravity in both cases. We then use these compensator solutions to
construct models of two-dimensional supersymmetric cosmological black holes.
