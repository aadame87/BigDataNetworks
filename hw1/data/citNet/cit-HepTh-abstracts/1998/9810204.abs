  We discuss some general features of black holes of five-dimensional
supergravity, such as the first law of black hole mechanics. We also discuss
some special features of rotating supersymmetric black holes. In particular, we
show that the horizon is a non-singular, and {\sl non-rotating}, null
hypersurface whose intersection with a Cauchy surface is a squashed 3-sphere.
We find the Killing spinors of the near-horizon geometry and thereby determine
the near-horizon isometry supergroup.
