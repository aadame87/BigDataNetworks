  An approach to calculating approximate solutions to the continuum
Schwinger-Dyson equations is outlined, with examples for \phi^4 in D=1. This
approach is based on the source Galerkin methods developed by Garcia, Guralnik
and Lawson. Numerical issues and opportunities for future calculations are also
discussed briefly.
