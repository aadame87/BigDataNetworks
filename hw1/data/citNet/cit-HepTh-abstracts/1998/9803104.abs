  We develop Truncated Conformal Space (TCS) technique for perturbations of c=1
Conformal Field Theories. We use it to give the first numerical evidence of the
validity of the non-linear integral equation (NLIE) derived from light-cone
lattice regularization at intermediate scales. A controversy on the
quantization of Bethe states is solved by this numerical comparison and by
using the locality principle at the ultra- violet fixed point. It turns out
that the correct quantization for pure hole states is the one with half-integer
quantum numbers originally proposed by Mariottini et al. Once the correct rule
is imposed, the agreement between TCS and NLIE for pure hole states turns out
to be impressive.
