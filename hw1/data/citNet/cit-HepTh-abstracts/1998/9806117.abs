  The osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of irreducible gauge theories
[hep-th/9712204] is generalized to L-stage reducible theories. The dependence
of the generating functional of Green's functions on the choice of gauge in the
massive case is dicussed and Ward identities related to osp(1,2) symmetry are
given. Massive first stage theories with closed gauge algebra are studied in
detail. The generalization of the Chapline-Manton model and topological
Yang-Mills theory to the case of massive fields is consedered as examples.
