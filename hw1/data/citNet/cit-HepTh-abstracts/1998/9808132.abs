  The product space configuration $AdS_2\times S_2$ (with $l$ and $r$ being
radiuses of the components) carrying the electric charge $Q$ is demonstrated to
be an exact solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations in presence of the
Maxwell field. If the logarithmic UV divergences are absent in the
four-dimensional theory the solution we find is identical to the classical
Bertotti-Robinson space ($r=l=Q$) with no quantum corrections added. In
general, the analysis involves the quadratic curvature coupling $\lambda$
appearing in the effective action. The solutions we find are of the following
types: i) (for arbitrary $\lambda$) charged configuration which is quantum
deformation of the Bertotti-Robinson space; ii) ($\lambda >\lambda_{cr}$) Q=0
configuration with $l$ and $r$ being of the Planck order; iii)
($\lambda<\lambda_{cr}$) $Q\neq 0$ configuration ($l$ and $r$ are of the Planck
order) not connected analytically to the Bertotti-Robinson space. The
interpretation of the solutions obtained and an indication on the internal
structure of the Schwarzschild black hole are discussed.
