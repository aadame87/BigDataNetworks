  The supercurrent components of the N=1, D=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory in the
Wess-Zumino gauge are coupled to the components of a background
supergravitation field in the ``new minimal'' representation, in order to
describe the various conservation laws in a functional way through the Ward
identities for the diffeomorphisms and for the local supersymmetry, Lorentz and
R-transformations. We also incorporate in the same functional formalism the
supertrace identities, which leads however to a slight modification of the new
minimal representation for supergravity, thus leading to a conformal version of
it. The most general classical action obeying all the symmetry constraints is
constructed.
