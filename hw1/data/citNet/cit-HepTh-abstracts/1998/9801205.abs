  It is confirmed that geodesic string junctions are necessary to describe the
gauge vectors of symmetry groups that arise in the context of IIB superstrings
compactified in the presence of nonlocal 7-branes. By examining the moduli
space of 7-brane backgrounds for which the dilaton and axion fields are
constant, we are able to describe explicitly and geometrically how open string
geodesics can fail to be smooth, and how geodesic string junctions then become
the relevant BPS representatives of the gauge bosons. The mechanisms that
guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the BPS representative of any gauge
vector are also shown to generalize to the case where the dilaton and axion
fields are not constant.
