  We consider a free massive spinor field in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space.
The usual Dirac action in bulk is supplemented by a certain boundary term. The
boundary conditions of the field are parametrized by a spinor on the boundary,
subject to a projection. We calculate the dependence of the partition function
on this boundary spinor. The result agrees with the generating functional of
the correlation functions of a quasi-primary spinor operator, of a certain
scaling dimension, in a free conformal field theory on the boundary.
