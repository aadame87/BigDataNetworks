  We calculate the absorption cross section by studying the spin--dependent
wave equation in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space(AdS$_3$). Here the
AdS/CFT correspondence is used. It turns out that the new gauge bosons coupled
to (2,0) and (0,2) operators on the boundary at infinity receive logarithmic
corrections. This shows that the gauge bosons may play the role of singletons
in AdS$_5$. On the other hand, test fields including the intermediate
scalars($\eta, \xi$) and fixed scalar($\lambda$) do not receive any logarithmic
correction in the first-order approximation.
