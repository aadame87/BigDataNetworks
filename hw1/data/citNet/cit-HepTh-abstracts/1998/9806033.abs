Title: Mode Analysis and Duality Symmetry in Different Dimensions

  The problem of duality symmetry in free field models is examined in details
by performing a mode expansion of these fields which provides a mapping with
the purely quantum mechanical example of a harmonic oscillator. By analysing
the duality symmetry in the harmonic oscillator, we show that the massless
scalar theory in two dimensions display, along with the expected discrete $Z_2$
symmetry, the continuous SO(2) symmetry as well. The same holds for the free
Maxwell theory in four dimensions, which is usually regarded to manifest only
the SO(2) symmetry. This leads to the new result that, following a proper
interpretation, the duality groups in two and four dimensions become identical.
Incidentally, duality in quantum mechanics is generally not covered in the
literature that considers only $D=4k$ or $D=4k+2$ spacetime dimensions, for
integral $k$.
