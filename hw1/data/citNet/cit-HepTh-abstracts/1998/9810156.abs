  We study caustics in classical and quantum mechanics for systems with
quadratic Lagrangians. We derive a closed form of the transition amplitude on
caustics and discuss their physical implications in the Gaussian slit
(gedanken-)experiment. Application to the quantum mechanical rotor casts doubt
on the validilty of Jevicki's correspondence hypothesis which states that in
quantum mechanics, stationary points(instantons) arise as simple poles.
