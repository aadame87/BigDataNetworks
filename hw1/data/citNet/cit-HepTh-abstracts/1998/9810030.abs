  Statistical method is applied to Neveu and Schwartz model for obtaining the
average characteristics of the heavy resonances: spin distribution, decay
widths etc. The properties of the dual model spectrum of states constructed of
both commuting and anticommuting operators are considered. In this case the
spin characteristics coincide with the results of the statistical bootstrap
model.
