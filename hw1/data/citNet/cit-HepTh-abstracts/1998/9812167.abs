  We discuss the application of the method of the gaugeless Hamiltonian
reduction to general relativity. This method is based on explicit resolving the
global part of the energy constraint and on identification of one of the metric
components with the evolution parameter of the equivalent unconstrained
(reduced) system. The Hamiltonian reduction reveals a possibility to unify
General Relativity and Standard Model of strong and electro-weak interactions
with the modulus of the Higgs field identified with the product of the
determinant of 3D metric and the Planck constant. We give the geometrical
foundation of the scalar field, derive and discuss experimental consequences of
this unified model: the cosmic Higgs vacuum, the Hoyle-Narlikar cosmology, a
$\sigma$-model version of Standard Model without Higgs particle excitations and
inflation.
