  We computed the statistical entropy of nonextremal 4D and extremal 5D
Calabi-Yau black holes and found exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy. The computation is based on the fact that the near-horizon geometry of
equivalent representations contains as a factor the
Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole and on subsequent use of Strominger's
proposal generalizing the statistical count of microstates of the BTZ black
hole due to Carlip.
