Title: Vortex Solutions of a Fermion Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory

  We explain how static multi-vortex solutions arise in non-linear field
theories, by taking the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation coupled to
Chern-Simons field (Jackiw-Pi model) and a fermion Chern-Simons theory as
simple examples. We then construct a fermion Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory which
has consistent static field equations, and show that it has the same vortex
solutions as the Jackiw-Pi model, but gives rise to quite different vortex
dynamics.
