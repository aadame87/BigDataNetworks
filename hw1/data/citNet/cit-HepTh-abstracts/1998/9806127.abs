  We find the inconsistency of dimensional reduction and naive dimensional
regularization in their applications to Chern-Simons type gauge theories.
Further we adopt a consistent dimensional regularization to investigate the
quantum correction to non-Abelian Chern-Simons term coupled with fermionic
matter. Contrary to previous results, we find that not only the Chern-Simons
coefficient receives quantum correction from spinor fields, but the spinor
field also gets a finite quantum correction.
