  It is proved that the quantum massive gauge field theory established in the
former papers is renormalizable. This conclusion is achieved with the aid of
the Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by the generating functionals which
were derived in the preceding paper based on the BRST-symmetry of the theory.
By the use of the Ward-Takahashi identity, it is shown that the S-matrix
evaluated by the massive gauge field theory is gauge-independent and hence
unitary. This fact allows us to prove the renormalizability of the theroy
firstly in the physical Landau gauge and then extend the proof to the other
gauges. As a result of the proof, it is found that the renormalization
constants for the massive gauge field theory comply with the same identity as
that for the massless gauge field theory.
