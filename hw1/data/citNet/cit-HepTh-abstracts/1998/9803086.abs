  We show how to use D and NS fivebranes in Type IIB superstring theory to
construct large classes of finite N=1 supersymmetric four dimensional field
theories. In this construction, the beta functions of the theories are directly
related to the bending of branes; in finite theories the branes are not bent,
and vice versa. Many of these theories have multiple dimensionless couplings. A
group of duality transformations acts on the space of dimensionless couplings;
for a large subclass of models, this group always includes an overall
$SL(2,\ZZ)$ invariance. In addition, we find even larger classes of theories
which, although not finite, also have one or more marginal operators.
