  We use different techniques to analyze the system formed by a D0 brane and a
D6 brane (with background gauge fields) in relative motion. In particular,
using the closed string formalism of boosted boundary states, we show the
presence of a term linear in the velocity, corresponding to the Lorentz force
experienced by the D0 brane moving in the magnetic background produced by the
D6 brane. This term, that was missed in previous analyses of this system, comes
entirely from the R-R odd spin structure and is also reproduced by a M(atrix)
theory calculation.
