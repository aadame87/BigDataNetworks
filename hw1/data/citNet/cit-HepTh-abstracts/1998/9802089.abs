  Wilsonian effective actions are interpreted as free energies in ensembles
with prescribed field expectation values and prescribed connected two-point
functions. Since such free energies are directly obtained from
two-particle-irreducible functionals, it follows that Wilsonian effective
actions satisfy elementary perturbative consistency conditions, and
non-perturbative convexity conditions. In particular, the exact determination
of a Wilsonian action by other means (e.g. supersymmetry) allows one to extract
restrictions on the particular cutoff scheme and field reparametrization that
would lead to such a Wilsonian action from an underlying microscopic action.
