  A type IIA string (or F-theory) compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold is
believed to be dual to a heterotic string on a K3 surface times a 2-torus (or
on a K3 surface). We consider how the resulting moduli space of hypermultiplets
is identified between these two pictures in the case of the E8xE8 heterotic
string. As examples we discuss SU(2)-bundles and G2-bundles on the K3 surface
and the case of point-like instantons. We are lead to a rather beautiful
identification between the integral cohomology of the Calabi-Yau threefold and
some integral structures on the heterotic side somewhat reminiscent of mirror
symmetry. We discuss the consequences for probing nonperturbative effects in
the both the type IIA string and the heterotic string.
