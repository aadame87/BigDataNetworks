  We propose an algorithm, based on Algebraic Renormalization, that allows the
restoration of Slavnov-Taylor invariance at every order of perturbation
expansion for an anomaly-free BRS invariant gauge theory. The counterterms are
explicitly constructed in terms of a set of one-particle-irreducible Feynman
amplitudes evaluated at zero momentum (and derivatives of them). The approach
is here discussed in the case of the abelian Higgs-Kibble model, where the zero
momentum limit can be safely performed. The normalization conditions are
imposed by means of the Slavnov-Taylor invariants and are chosen in order to
simplify the calculation of the counterterms. In particular within this model
all counterterms involving BRS external sources (anti-fields) can be put to
zero with the exception of the fermion sector.
