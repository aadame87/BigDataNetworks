  The general solution of a 7D analogue of the 3D Euler top equation is shown
to be given by an integration over a Riemann surface with genus 9. The 7D model
is derived from the 8D $Spin(7)$ invariant self-dual Yang-Mills equation
depending only upon one variable and is regarded as a model describing
self-dual membrane instantons. Several integrable reductions of the 7D top to
lower target space dimensions are discussed and one of them gives 6, 5, 4D
descendants and the 3D Euler top associated with Riemann surfaces with genus 6,
5, 2 and 1, respectively.
