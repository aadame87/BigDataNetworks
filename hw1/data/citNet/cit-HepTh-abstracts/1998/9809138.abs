  If constituent quarks are to emerge from QCD they must have well defined
colour and be energetically favoured. After reviewing the general properties of
charges in gauge theories, a method for constructing charges is presented and
applied to the infra-red structure of the theory and to the interquark
potential. Both of these applications supply a physical interpretation of the
structures found in the construction of charges. We will see that constituent
structures arise in QCD.
