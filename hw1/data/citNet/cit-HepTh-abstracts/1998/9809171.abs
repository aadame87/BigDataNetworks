Title: New supersymmetry algebras from partial supersymmetry breaking
Authors: Jonathan A. Bagger and Richard Altendorfer
Comments: Talk delivered at PASCOS 98 (Boston, MA) and SUSY 98 (Oxford, UK)
\\
  In this talk we will study the partial breaking of supersymmetry in flat and
anti de Sitter space. We will see that partial breaking in flat space can be
accomplished using either of two representations for the massive N=1 spin-3/2
multiplet. We will "unHiggs" each representation and find a new N=2
supergravity and a new N=2 supersymmetry algebra. We will also see that partial
supersymmetry breaking in AdS space can give rise to a new N=2 supersymmetry
algebra, one that is necessarily nonlinearly realized.
