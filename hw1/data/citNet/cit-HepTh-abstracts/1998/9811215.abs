Title: Off-critical correlations in the Ashkin-Teller model
Authors: G. Delfino
Comments: 8 pages, latex

\\
  We use the exact scattering description of the scaling Ashkin-Teller model in
two dimensions to compute the two-particle form factors of the relevant
operators. These provide an approximation for the correlation functions whose
accuracy is tested against exact sum rules.
