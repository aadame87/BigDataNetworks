Title: The Physics of Negative Energy Densities
Authors: Adam D. Helfer
Comments: 10 pages, latex, uses sprocl, talk given at the Quantum Fields in
  External Potentials Workshop, Leipzig, 1998

  I review some recent results showing that the physics of negative energy
densities, as predicted by relativistic quantum field theories, is more
complicated than has generally been appreciated. On the one hand, in external
potentials where there is a time--dependence, however slight, the Hamiltonians
are unbounded below. On the other, there are limitations of quantum measurement
in detecting or utilizing these negative energies.
