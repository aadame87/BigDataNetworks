  We show that the BPS configurations of uniform field strength can be
interpreted as those for sheets of infinite number of BPS magnetic monopoles,
and found that the number of normalizable zero modes per each magnetic monopole
charge is four. We identify monopole sheets as the intersecting planes of D3
branes. Similar analysis on self-dual instanton configurations is worked out
and the number of zero modes per each instanton number is found to match that
of single isolated instanton.
