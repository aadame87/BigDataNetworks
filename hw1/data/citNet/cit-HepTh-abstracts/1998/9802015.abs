  We develop an unambiguous and practical method to calculate one-loop quantum
corrections to the energies of classical time-independent field configurations
in renormalizable field theories. We show that the standard perturbative
renormalization procedure suffices here as well. We apply our method to a
simplified model where a charged scalar couples to a neutral "Higgs" field, and
compare our results to the derivative expansion.
