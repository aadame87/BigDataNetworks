  Monopole ``superpartner'' solutions are constructed by acting with finite,
broken supersymmetry transformations on a bosonic N=2 BPS monopole. The terms
beyond first order in this construction represent the backreaction of the the
fermionic zero-mode state on the other fields. Because of the quantum nature of
the fermionic zero-modes, the superpartner solution is necessarily operator
valued. We extract the electric dipole moment operator and show that it is
proportional to the fermion zero-mode angular momentum operator with a
gyroelectric ratio g=2. The magnetic quadrupole operator is shown to vanish
identically on all states. We comment on the usefulness of the monopole
superpartner solution for a study of the long-range spin dependent dynamics of
BPS monopoles.
