  It is shown that in general the energy ${\cal E}$ and the Hamiltonian ${\cal
H}$ of matter fields on the black hole exterior play different roles. ${\cal
H}$ is a generator of the time evolution along the Killing time while ${\cal
E}$ enters the first law of black hole thermodynamics. For non-minimally
coupled fields the difference ${\cal H}-{\cal E}$ is not zero and is a Noether
charge $Q$ analogous to that introduced by Wald to define the black hole
entropy. If fields vanish at the spatial boundary, $Q$ is reduced to an
integral over the horizon. The analysis is carried out and an explicit
expression for $Q$ is found for general diffeomorphism invariant theories. As
an extension of the results by Wald et al, the first law of black hole
thermodynamics is derived for arbitrary weak matter fields.
