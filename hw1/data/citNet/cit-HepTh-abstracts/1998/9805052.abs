  In analogy to the class structure $\GL(\R^4)/\O(1,3)$ for general relativity
with a local Lorentz group as stabilizer and a basic tetrad field for the
parametrization, a corresponding class structure $\GL(\C^2)/\U(2)$ is
investigated for the standard model with a local hyperisospin group $\U(2)$.
The lepton, quark, Higgs and gauge fields, used in the standard model, cannot
be basic in a coset interpretation, they may to be taken as first order terms
in a flat spacetime, particle oriented expansion of a basic field (as the
analogue to the tetrad) and its products.
