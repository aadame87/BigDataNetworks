  Starting with two supersymmetric dual theories, we imagine adding a chiral
perturbation that breaks supersymmetry dynamically. At low energy we then get
two theories with soft supersymmetry-breaking terms that are generated
dynamically. With a canonical Kahler potential, some of the scalars of the
"magnetic" theory typically have negative mass-squared, and the vector-like
symmetry is broken. Since for large supersymmetry breaking the "electric"
theory becomes ordinary QCD, the two theories are then incompatible. For small
supersymmetry breaking, if duality still holds, the magnetic theory analysis
implies specific patterns of chiral symmetry breaking in supersymmetric QCD
with small soft masses.
