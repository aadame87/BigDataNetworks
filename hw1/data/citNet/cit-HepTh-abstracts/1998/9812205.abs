Title: M theory, Joyce Orbifolds and Super Yang-Mills
Author: B.S. Acharya
Comments: v2: A careless error which appeared at the end of section four and
  propagated to section six has been corrected. (The mistake was to identify
  the Coxeter number of the gauge group with the order of a certain finite
  group). The results are unchanged. Some references have also been added. v3:
  A previously unrecognised monodromy recognised. New monodromy free examples
  added. 21 pages, Latex
Report-no: QMW-PH-98-42

  We geometrically engineer d=4 N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories by
considering M theory on various Joyce orbifolds. We argue that the
superpotential of these models is generated by fractional membrane instantons.
The relation of this superpotential to membrane anomalies is also discussed.
