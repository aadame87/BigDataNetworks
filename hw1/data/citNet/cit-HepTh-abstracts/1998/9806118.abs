  We will establish the connection between the Lorentz covariant and so-called
single-time formulation for the quark Wigner operator. To this end we will
discuss the initial value problem for the Wigner operator of a field theory and
give a discussion of the gauge-covariant formulation for the Wigner operator
including some new results concerning the chiral limit. We discuss the gradient
or semi-classical expansion and the color and spinor decomposition of the
equations of motion for the Wigner operator. The single-time formulation will
be derived from the covariant formulation by taking energy moments of the
equations for the Wigner operator. For external fields we prove that only the
lowest energy moments of the quark Wigner operator contain dynamical
information.
