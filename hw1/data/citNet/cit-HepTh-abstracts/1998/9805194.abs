Title: Massive Gauge Field Theory Without Higgs Mechanism IV. Illustration of
  Unitarsity

\\
  To illustrate the unitarity of the massive gauge field theory described in
the foregoing papers, we calculate the imaginary part of two-gauge boson and
fermion-antifermion scattering amplitudes in the fourth order perturbative
approximation. Through these calculations, we find that for a given process, if
all the diagrams are taken into account, the contributions arising from the
unphysical intermediate states to the amplitudes are eventually cancelled out.
Thus, the unitarity of the S-matrix is perfectly ensured.
