  We consider multicenter supergravity solutions corresponding to Higgs phases
of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with Z_N symmetric vacua. In certain
energy regimes, we find a description in terms of a generalized wormhole
solution that corresponds to the SL(2,R)/U(1) \times SU(2)/U(1) exact conformal
field theory. We show that U-dualities map these backgrounds to purely
gravitational ones and comment on the relation to the black holes arising from
intersecting D1 and D5 branes. We also discuss supersymmetric properties of the
various solutions and the relation to 2-dim solitons, on flat space, of the
reduced axion-dilaton-gravity equations. Finally, we address the problem of
understanding other supergravity solutions from the multicenter ones. As
prototype examples we use rotating D3 branes and NS5 and D5 branes associated
to non-Abelian duals of 4-dim hyper-Kahler metrics with SO(3) isometry.
