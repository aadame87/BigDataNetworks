  By making use of the duality transformation, gauge field correlators of the
Abelian Higgs Model are studied in the London limit. The obtained results are
in a good agreement with the dual Meissner scenario of confinement and with the
Stochastic Model of QCD vacuum. The nontrivial contribution to the quartic
correlator arising due to accounting for the finiteness of the coupling
constant is discussed.
