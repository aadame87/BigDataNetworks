  The equation for QCD string proposed earlier is reviewed. This equation
appears when we examine the gonihedric string model and the corresponding
transfer matrix. Arguing that string equation should have a generalized Dirac
form we found the corresponding infinite-dimensional gamma matrices as a
symmetric solution of the Majorana commutation relations. The generalized gamma
matrices are anticommuting and guarantee unitarity of the theory at all orders
of $v/c$. In the second quantized form the equation does not have unwanted
ghost states in Fock space. In the absence of Casimir mass terms the spectrum
reminds hydrogen exitations. On every mass level $r=2,4,..$ there are different
charged particles with spin running from $j=1/2$ up to $j_{max}=r-1/2$, and the
degeneracy is equal to $d_{r}=2r-1 = 2j_{max}$. This is in contrast with the
exponential degeneracy in superstring theory.
