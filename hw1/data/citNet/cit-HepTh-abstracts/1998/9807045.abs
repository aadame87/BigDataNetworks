  We construct explicit multivortex solutions for the first and second complex
sine-Gordon equations. The constructed solutions are expressible in terms of
the modified Bessel and rational functions, respectively. The vorticity-raising
and lowering Backlund transformations are interpreted as the Schlesinger
transformations of the fifth Painleve equation.
