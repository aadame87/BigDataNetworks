  We establish the second quantized solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation on the half line with a mixed boundary condition. The solution is
based on a new algebraic structure, which we call boundary exchange algebra and
which substitutes, in the presence of boundaries, the familiar
Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra.
