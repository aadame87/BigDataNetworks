  Using noncommutative geometry, the standard tools of differential geometry
can be extended to a broad class of spaces whose coordinates are noncommuting
operators acting on a Hilbert space. In the simplest case of coordinates being
matrix valued functions on space-time, the standard model of particle physics
can be reconstructed out of a few basic principles. Following these ideas, we
investigate the general case of models arising from matrices and give the
resulting constraints on the scalar potential and gauge couplings constants, as
well as some relations between fermionic and bosonic masses.
