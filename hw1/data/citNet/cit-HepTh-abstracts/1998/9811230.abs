  This paper lays groundwork for the detailed study of the non-trivial
renormalization group flow connecting supersymmetric fixed points in four
dimensions using string theory on AdS spaces. Specifically, we consider
D3-branes placed at singularities of Calabi-Yau threefolds which generalize the
conifold singularity and have an ADE classification. The $\CN=1$ superconformal
theories dictating their low-energy dynamics are infrared fixed points arising
from deforming the corresponding ADE $\CN=2$ superconformal field theories by
mass terms for adjoint chiral fields. We probe the geometry with a single
$D3$-brane and discuss the near-horizon supergravity solution for a large
number $N$ of coincident $D3$-branes.
