  We show that the string tension in N=1 two-dimensional super Yang-Mills
theory vanishes independently of the representation of the quark anti-quark
external source. We argue that this result persists in SQCD_2 and in
two-dimensional gauge theories with extended supersymmetry or in chiral
invariant models with at least one massless dynamical fermion. We also compute
the string tension for the massive Schwinger model, as a demonstration of the
method of the calculation.
