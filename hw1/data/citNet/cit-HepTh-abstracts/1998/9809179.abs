  We study the amplitude for exchange of massless gauge bosons between pairs of
massive scalar fields in Anti-de Sitter space. In the AdS/CFT correspondence
this amplitude describes the contribution of conserved flavor symmetry currents
to 4-point functions of scalar operators in the boundary conformal theory. A
concise, covariant (Y2K-compatible) derivation of the gauge boson propagator in
$\AdS_{d+1}$ is given. Techniques are developed to calculate the two bulk
integrals over AdS space leading to explicit expressions or convenient, simple
integral representations for the amplitude. The amplitude contains leading
power and sub-leading logarithmic singularities in the gauge boson channel and
leading logarithms in the crossed channel. The new methods of this paper are
expected to have other applications in the study of the Maldacena conjecture.
