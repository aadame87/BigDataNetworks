  The fivebrane worldvolume theory in eleven dimensions is known to contain BPS
threebrane solitons which can also be interpreted as a fivebrane whose
worldvolume is wrapped around a Riemann surface. By considering configurations
of intersecting fivebranes and hence intersecting threebrane solitons, we
determine the Bogomol'nyi equations for more general BPS configurations. We
obtain differential equations, generalising Cauchy-Riemann equations, which
imply that the worldvolume of the fivebrane is wrapped around a calibrated
geometry.
