  Spherical field theory is a new non-perturbative method for studying quantum
field theories. It uses the spherical partial wave expansion to reduce a
general d-dimensional Euclidean field theory into a set of coupled
one-dimensional systems. The coupled one-dimensional systems are then converted
to partial differential equations and solved numerically. We demonstrate the
methods of spherical field theory by analyzing Euclidean phi^4 theory in two
dimensions.
