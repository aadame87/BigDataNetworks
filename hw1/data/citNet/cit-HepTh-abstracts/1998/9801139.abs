  Extending previous work on geometric engineering of N=1 Yang-Mills in four
dimensions for simply laced ($A_n,D_n,E_{6,7,8}$) gauge groups, we construct
local models for all other gauge groups ($B_n,C_n,F_4,G_2$) in terms of
F-theory. We compute the radius dependent superpotential upon further
compactification on a circle to $d=3$ in the dual M-theory and use it to show
that the number of vacua in four dimensions for each group is given by its dual
coxeter number, in accordance with expectations based on gaugino condensates.
