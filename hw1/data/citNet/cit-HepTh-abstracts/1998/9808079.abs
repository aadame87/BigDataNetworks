  We examine the AdS/CFT correspondence when the gauge theory is considered on
a compactified space with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions. We find
that the corresponding supergravity solution has a negative energy, in
agreement with the expected negative Casimir energy in the field theory.
Stability of the gauge theory would imply that this supergravity solution has
minimum energy among all solutions with the same boundary conditions. Hence we
are lead to conjecture a new positive energy theorem for asymptotically locally
Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. We show that the candidate minimum energy solution
is stable against all quadratic fluctuations of the metric.
