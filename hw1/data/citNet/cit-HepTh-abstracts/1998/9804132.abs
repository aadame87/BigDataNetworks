  We present an analytical continuum calculation, starting from first
principles, of the vacuum wavefunction and string tension for pure Yang-Mills
theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions, extending our previous analysis using
gauge-invariant matrix variables. The vacuum wavefunction is consistent with
what is expected at both high and low momentum regimes. The value of the string
tension is in very good agreement with recent lattice Monte Carlo evaluations.
