  ``Constants of Nature'' and cosmological parameters may in fact be variables
related to some slowly-varying fields. In models of eternal inflation, such
fields will take different values in different parts of the universe. Here I
show how one can assign probabilities to values of the ``constants'' measured
by a typical observer. This method does not suffer from ambiguities previously
discussed in the literature.
