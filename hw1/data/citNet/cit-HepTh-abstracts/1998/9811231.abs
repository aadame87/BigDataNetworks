  We review our recent work, hep-th/9803030, on the constraints imposed by
global or local symmetries on perturbative quantum field theories. The analysis
is performed in the Bogoliubov-Shirkov-Epstein-Glaser formulation of
perturbative quantum field theory. In this formalism the S-matrix is
constructed directly in the asymptotic Fock space with only input causality and
Poincare invariance. We reformulate the symmetry condition proposed in our
earlier work in terms of interacting Noether currents.
