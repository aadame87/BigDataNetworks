  We analyze the induction and restriction of sectors for nets of subfactors
defined by Longo and Rehren. Picking a local subfactor we derive a formula
which specifies the structure of the induced sectors in terms of the original
DHR sectors of the smaller net and canonical endomorphisms. We also obtain a
reciprocity formula for induction and restriction of sectors, and we prove a
certain homomorphism property of the induction mapping.
  Developing further some ideas of F. Xu we will apply this theory in a
forthcoming paper to nets of subfactors arising from conformal field theory, in
particular those coming from conformal embeddings or orbifold inclusions of
SU(n) WZW models. This will provide a better understanding of the labeling of
modular invariants by certain graphs, in particular of the A-D-E classification
of SU(2) modular invariants.
