  The action for 2d dilatonic supergravity with dilaton coupled matter and
dilaton multiplets is constructed. Trace anomaly and anomaly induced effective
action (in components as well as in supersymmetric form) for matter
supermultiplet on bosonic background are found. The one-loop effective action
and large-$N$ effective action for quantum dilatonic supergravity are also
calculated. Using induced effective action one can estimate the back-reaction
of dilaton coupled matter to the classical black hole solutions of dilatonic
supergravity. That is done on the example of supersymmetric CGHS model with
dilaton coupled quantum matter where Hawking radiation which turns out to be
zero is calculated. Similar 2d analysis maybe used to study spherically
symmetric collapse for other models of 4d supergravity.
