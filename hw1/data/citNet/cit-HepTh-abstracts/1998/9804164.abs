  Extending our previous work on SU(3), we construct spherically symmetric BPS
saturated regular configurations of N=4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
preserving 1/4 supersymmetry, and investigate their features. We also give
exact solutions in the case some of the free parameters of the general
solutions take certain values. These field theory BPS states correspond to the
string theory BPS states of multi-pronged strings connecting N different
D3-branes by regarding the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory as an effective
field theory on parallel D3-branes. We compare our solutions with multi-pronged
strings in string picture.
