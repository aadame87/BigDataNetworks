  We discuss the large N limit of the (2,0) field theory in six dimensions. We
do this by assuming the validity of Maldacena's conjecture of the
correspondence between large N gauge theories and supergravity backgrounds,
here $AdS_7\times S^4$. We review the spectrum of the supergravity theory and
compute the spectrum of primary operators of the conformal algebra of arbitrary
spin.
