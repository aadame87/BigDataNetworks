  The Cremmer-Scherk mechanism is generalised in a non-Abelian context. In the
presence of the Higgs scalars of the standard model it is argued that fields
arising from the low energy effective string action may contribute to the mass
generation of the observed vector bosons that mediate the electroweak
interactions and that future analyses of experimental data should consider the
possibility of string induced radiative corrections to the Weinberg angle
coming from physics beyond the standard model.
