  We analyze the finite temperature chiral restoration transition of the
$(D=d+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model for the case of a large number of
flavors and fixed total fermion number. This leads to the study of the model
with a nonzero imaginary chemical potential. In this formulation of the theory,
we have obtained that, in the transition region, the model is described by a
chiral conformal field theory where the concepts of dimensional reduction and
universality do apply due to a transmutation of statistics which makes fermions
act as if they were bosons, having zero energy. This result should be generic
for theories with dynamical symmetry breaking, such as Quantum Chromodynamics.
