  We study the interaction of gauge fields of arbitrary integer spins with the
constant electromagnetic field. We reduce the problem of obtaining the
gauge-invariant Lagrangian of integer spin fields in the external field to
purely algebraic problem of finding a set of operators with certain features
using the representation of the high-spin fields in the form of vectors in a
pseudo-Hilbert space. We consider such a construction up to the second order in
the electromagnetic field strength and also present an explicit form of
interaction Lagrangian for a massive particle of spin $s$ in terms of
symmetrical tensor fields in linear approximation. The result obtained does not
depend on dimensionality of space-time.
