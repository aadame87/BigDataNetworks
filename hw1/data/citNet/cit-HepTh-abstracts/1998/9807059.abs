  The vacuum structure of N=2 (and N=4) SUSY Yang-Mills theory is analyzed in
detail by considering the effective potential for constant background scalar-
magnetic fields within different approximations. We compare the one-loop
approximation with- or without instanton improved effective coupling with the
one-loop result in the dual desription. For N=2 we find that non-perturbative
monopole degrees of freedom remove the non-trivial minima present in the
(improved) one-loop potential in the strong-coupling regime. The combination of
Yang-Mills and dual desription leads to a self-consistent effective potential
over the full range of background fields.
