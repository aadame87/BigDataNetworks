  Theories in more than ten dimensions play an important role in understanding
nonperturbative aspects of string theory. Consistent compactifications of such
theories can be constructed via Calabi-Yau fourfolds. These models can be
analyzed particularly efficiently in the Landau-Ginzburg phase of the linear
sigma model, when available. In the present paper we focus on those sigma
models which have both a Landau-Ginzburg phase and a geometric phase described
by hypersurfaces in weighted projective five-space. We describe some of the
pertinent properties of these models, such as the cohomology, the connectivity
of the resulting moduli space, and mirror symmetry among the 1,100,055
configurations which we have constructed.
