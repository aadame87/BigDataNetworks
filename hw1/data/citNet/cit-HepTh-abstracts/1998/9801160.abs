  Starting with the D-dimensional Einstein-dilaton-antisymmetric form equations
and assuming a block-diagonal form of a metric we derive a $(D-d)$-dimensional
$\sigma$-model with the target space $SL(d,R)/SO(d) \times SL(2,R)/SO(2) \times
R$ or its non-compact form. Various solution-generating techniques are
developed and applied to construct some known and some new $p$-brane solutions.
It is shown that the Harrison transformation belonging to the $SL(2,R)$
subgroup generates black $p$-branes from the seed Schwarzschild solution. A
fluxbrane generalizing the Bonnor-Melvin-Gibbons-Maeda solution is constructed
as well as a non-linear superposition of the fluxbrane and a spherical black
hole. A new simple way to endow branes with additional internal structure such
as plane waves is suggested. Applying the harmonic maps technique we generate
new solutions with a non-trivial shell structure in the transverse space
(`matrioshka' $p$-branes). It is shown that the $p$-brane intersection rules
have a simple geometric interpretation as conditions ensuring the symmetric
space property of the target space. Finally, a Bonnor-type symmetry is used to
construct a new magnetic 6-brane with a dipole moment in the ten-dimensional
IIA theory.
