  We consider certain orbifoldization of the ${\cal N}=4$ field theories that
leads to ${\cal N}=2,1,0$ field theories in 4 dimensions. These theories were
recently analyzed using the string theory perturbation technique. It was found
that in the large $N$ limit all correlation functions of the orbifold theories
coincide with those of ${\cal N}=4$, modulo the rescaling of the gauge coupling
constant. In this paper we repeat the same analysis using the field theoretical
language.
