  An interesting tool for investigating the quantum features of a field theory
is the introduction of compensating fields. For instance, the anomalous
divergence of the chiral current can be calculated in the field-antifield
formalism from an extended form of QCD with compensating fields. The
interpretation of this procedure from the bosonized point of view, in the two
dimensional case, crucially depends on the possibility of defining a bosonized
version for the extended theory. We show, by using some recent results on the
soldering of bosonized actions corresponding to chiral fermions, how is the
mapping between bosonic and fermionic representations of this extended $QCD_2$.
In the bosonic formulation the anomalous divergence of the chiral current shows
up from the equations of motion of the compensating fields.
