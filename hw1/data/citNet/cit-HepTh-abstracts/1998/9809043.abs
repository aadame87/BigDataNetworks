  We look at the vertical dimensional reduction of the supermembrane of
M-theory to the D2-brane of Type IIA string theory. Our approach considers the
soliton solutions of the two low energy field limits, D=11 and D=10 Type IIA
supergravities, rather than the worldvolume actions. It is thus necessary to
create a periodic array. The standard Kaluza-Klein procedure requires that the
brane is smeared over a transverse direction, but we will keep the dependence
on the compactification coordinate, seeing how the eleventh dimension comes
into play when we close up on the D2-brane.
