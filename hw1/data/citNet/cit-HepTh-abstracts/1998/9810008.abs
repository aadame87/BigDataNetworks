  Trace anomaly for dilaton coupled conformal theories on curved background
with non-zero dilaton is found from supergravity side as an IR effect using
AdS/CFT correspondence. For $d=2$ it coincides with the conformal anomaly for
dilaton coupled scalar (up to total derivative term which is known to be
ambiguous). In four-dimensional case we get conformal anomaly for ${\cal N}=4$
super YM theory interacting with conformal supergravity. In the same way the
calculation of dilaton dependent conformal anomaly in higher dimensions seems
to be much easier than using standard QFT methods.
