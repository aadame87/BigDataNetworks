Title: Kadomtsev-Petviashvili Hierarchy and Generalized Kontsevich Model

  The review is devoted to the integrable properties of the Generalized
Kontsevich Model which is supposed to be an universal matrix model to describe
the conformal field theories with $c<1$. It is shown that the deformations of
the "monomial" phase to "polynomial" one have the natural interpretation in
context of so-called equivalent hierarchies. The dynamical transition between
equivalent integrable systems is exactly along the flows of the dispersionless
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy; the coefficients of the potential are shown
to be directly related with the flat (quasiclassical) times arising in N=2
Landau-Ginzburg topological model. The Virasoro constraint for solution with an
arbitrary potential is shown to be a standard $\L_{-p}$-constraint of the
(equivalent) $p$-reduced hierarchy with the times additively corrected by the
flat coordinates.
