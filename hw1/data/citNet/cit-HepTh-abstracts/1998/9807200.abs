  We discuss stability of non-supersymmetric compactification of M-theory and
string theory of the form AdS * X, and their dual non-supersymmetric
interacting conformal field theories. We argue some of the difficulties in
controlling 1/N-corrections disappear in the cases that the large-N dual
conformal field theory has no invariant marginal operators (and in some cases
with no exactly marginal operators only). We provide several examples of such
compactifications of M-theory down to AdS4.
