  We construct the SO(32) spinor state in weakly coupled type I string theory
as a kink solution of the tachyon field on the D-string - anti-D-string pair
and calculate its mass. We also give a description of this system in terms of
an exact boundary conformal field theory and show that in this description this
state can be regarded as a non-supersymmetric D0-brane in type I string theory.
This construction can be generalised to represent the D0-brane in type IIA
string theory as a vortex solution of the tachyon field on the membrane
anti-membrane pair, and the D-string of type I string theory as a topological
soliton of the tachyon field on the D5-brane anti- D5-brane pair.
