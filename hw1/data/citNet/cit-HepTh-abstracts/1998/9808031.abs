  We consider properties of confining strings in 2+1 dimensional SU(2)
nonabelian gauge theory with the Higgs field in adjoint representation. The
analysis is carried out in the context of effective dual Lagrangian which
describes the dynamics of t'Hooft's $Z_{N}$ vorices. We point out that the same
Lagrangian should be interpreted as an effective Lagrangian for the lightest
glueballs. It is shown how the string tension for a fundamental string arises
in this description. We discuss the properties of the adjoint string and
explain how its breaking occurs when the distance between the charges exceeds a
critical value. The interaction between the fundamental strings is studied. It
is shown that they repel each other in the weak coupling regime. We argue that
in the confining regime (pure Yang-Mills theory, or a theory with a heavy Higgs
field) the strings actually attract each other and the crossover between the
two regimes corresponds to the crossover between the dual superconductors of
first and second kind.
