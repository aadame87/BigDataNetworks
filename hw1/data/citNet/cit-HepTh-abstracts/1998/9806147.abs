  We analyse the relationship between the N=2 harmonic and projective
superspaces which are the only approaches developed to describe general N=2
super Yang-Mills theories in terms of off-shell supermultiplets with
conventional supersymmetry. The structure of low-energy hypermultiplet
effective action is briefly discussed.
