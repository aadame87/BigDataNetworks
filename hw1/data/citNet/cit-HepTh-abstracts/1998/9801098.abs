  Starting from the known representation of the partition function of the 2-
and 3-D Ising models as an integral over Grassmann variables, we perform a
hopping expansion of the corresponding Pfaffian. We show that this expansion is
an exact, algebraic representation of the loop- and surface expansions (with
intrinsic geometry) of the 2- and 3-D Ising models. Such an algebraic calculus
is much simpler to deal with than working with the geometrical objects. For the
2-D case we show that the algebra of hopping generators allows a simple
algebraic treatment of the geometry factors and counting problems, and as a
result we obtain the corrected loop expansion of the free energy. We compute
the radius of convergence of this expansion and show that it is determined by
the critical temperature. In 3-D the hopping expansion leads to the surface
representation of the Ising model in terms of surfaces with intrinsic geometry.
Based on a representation of the 3-D model as a product of 2-D models coupled
to an auxiliary field, we give a simple derivation of the geometry factor which
prevents overcounting of surfaces and provide a classification of possible sets
of surfaces to be summed over. For 2- and 3-D we derive a compact formula for
2n-point functions in loop (surface) representation.
