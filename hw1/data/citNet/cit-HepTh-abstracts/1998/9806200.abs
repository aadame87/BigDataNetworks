  This talk is in two parts both entitled mass production requires precision
engineering. The first is about the dynamical generation of mass for matter
particles in gauge theories. I will explain how the details of this depend on a
precision knowledge of the interactions. The second is about tests of the
mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD that the precision engineering of
high luminosity colliders and particle detectors will shortly make possible.
  Since the latter topic has been described in Ref. 1, here I will just discuss
the first: the production of mass from nothing.
