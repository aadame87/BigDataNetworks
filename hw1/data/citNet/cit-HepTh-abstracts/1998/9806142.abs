  We investigate the low energy structure of the Kahler potential in SUSY QCD
with Nf=Nc+1 quark flavors. Since this theory's moduli space is everywhere
smooth, a systematic power series expansion of its Kahler potential can be
developed in terms of confined meson and baryon fields. Perturbation theory in
the supersymmetric sigma model based upon a momentum expansion consistent with
naive dimensional analysis and 1/Nf power counting exhibits some similarities
with ordinary QCD chiral perturbation theory along with several key
differences. We compute meson and baryon wavefunction renormalization as well
as Kahler potential operator mixing to leading nontrivial order. We also deduce
the asymptotic dependence of the lowest dimension operators' coefficients upon
moduli space location along flat directions where the theory is Higgsed down to
Nf-1=(Nc-1)+1 SUSY QCD. Although an exact form for the confining phase Kahler
potential remains unknown, we find that some detailed Kahler sector information
can nevertheless be derived from first principles.
