  We discuss the connection between Matrix string theory and the DLCQ of string
theory. Using this connection we describe the sense in which perturbative
string amplitudes are reproduced in the Matrix string theory. Using recent
realization of the connection between SYM and Supergravity, we suggest how to
describe Matrix theory with non-flat backgrounds.
