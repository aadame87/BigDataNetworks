  Upon compactification on a circle, SU(N) gauge theory with all fields in the
adjoint representation acquires a $Z_N$ global symmetry because the center of
the gauge group is $Z_N$. For N=4 super Yang-Mills theory, we show how this
$Z_N$ "topological symmetry" arises in the context of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, and why the symmetry group is $Z_N$ rather than U(1). This
provides a test of the AdS/CFT correspondence for finite N. If the theory is
formulated on $R^3 \times S^1$ with anti-periodic boundary conditions for
fermions around the $S^1$, the topological symmetry is spontaneously broken; we
show that the domain walls are D-strings, and hence that flux tubes associated
with magnetic confinement can end on the domain walls associated with the
topological symmetry. For the (0,2) $A_{N-1}$ superconformal field theory in
six dimensions, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon: a $Z_N$ global symmetry
group arises if this theory is compactified on a Riemann surface. In this case,
the domain walls are M-theory membranes.
