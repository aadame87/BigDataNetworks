  Spin interactions beteween two moving Dp-branes are analyzed using the
Green-Schwarz formalism of boundary states. This approach turns out to be
extremely efficient to compute all the spin effects related by supersymmetry to
the leading v^4/r^7-p term. All these terms are shown to be scale invariant,
supporting a matrix model description of supergravity interactions. By
employing the LSZ reduction formula for matrix theory and the mentioned
supersymmetric effective potential for D0-branes, we compute the t-pole of
graviton-graviton and three form-three form scattering in matrix theory. The
results are found to be in complete agreement with tree level supergravity in
the corresponding kinematical regime and provide, moreover, an explicit map
between these degrees of freedom in both theories.
