  It has been shown that a procedure analogous to orbifolding in string theory,
when applied to certain large N field theories, leaves correlators invariant
perturbatively. We test nonperturbative agreement of some aspects of the
orbifolded and non-orbifolded theories. More specifically, we find that the
period matrices of parent and orbifolded Seiberg-Witten theories are related,
even away from the 't Hooft limit. We also check that any large N theory which
has an infrared conformal fixed point and satisfies certain anomaly positivity
constraints required by theories with fixed points will continue to satisfy
those constraints after orbifolding. We discuss extensions of these results to
finite N.
