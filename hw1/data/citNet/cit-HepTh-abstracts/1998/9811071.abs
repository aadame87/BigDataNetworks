  We show that any solution of the SU(2) Skyrme model can be used to give a
topologically trivial solution of the SU(4) one. In addition, we extend the
method introduced by Houghton et al. and use harmonic maps from S2 to CP(N-1)
to construct low energy configurations of the SU(N) Skyrme models. We show that
one of such maps gives an exact, topologically trivial, solution of the SU(3)
model. We study various properties of these maps and show that, in general,
their energies are only marginally higher than the energies of the
corresponding SU(2) embeddings. Moreover, we show that the baryon (and energy)
densities of the SU(3) configurations with baryon number B=2-4 are more
symmetrical than their SU(2) analogues. We also present the baryon densities
for the B=5 and B=6 configurations and discuss their symmetries.
