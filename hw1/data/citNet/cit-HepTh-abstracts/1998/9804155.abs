Title: Second Quantization of the Stueckelberg Relativistic Quantum Theory and
  Associated Gauge Fields
Author: L.P. Horwitz
Comments: Plain TeX, 9 pages
Report-no: TAUP-2490-98
\\
  The gauge compensation fields induced by the differential operators of the
Stueckelberg-Schr\"odinger equation are discussed, as well as the relation
between these fields and the standard Maxwell fields. An action is constructed
and the second quantization of the fields carried out using a constraint
procedure. Some remarks are made on the properties of the second quantized
matter fields.
