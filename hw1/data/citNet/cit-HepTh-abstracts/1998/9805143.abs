  We study the dimensionality manifested in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show
that the dimensionality as expressed by the high temperature behavior of a
system has a holographic nature also at the quantum level. The emergence of the
AdS black hole as a master field at high temperature leads to the screening of
the extra dimensions in its excluded volume.
