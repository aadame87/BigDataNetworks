  This work is a comment on Ryder's derivation of the Dirac equation, with
emphasis on the physical contents of this equation: the notion of particles and
antiparticles according to the Stueckelberg-Feynman interpretation, the
opposite intrinsic parity between particles and antiparticles, and the spin.
