  We calculate the dimensions of operators in three and six dimensional
superconformal field theories by using the duality between these theories at
large N and D=11 supergravity on $AdS_{4/7} \times S^{7/4}$. We find that for
the duality relations to work the Kaluza--Klein masses given in the
supergravity literature must be rescaled and/or shifted.
