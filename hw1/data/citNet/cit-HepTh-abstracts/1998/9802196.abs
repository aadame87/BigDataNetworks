  We extend the Wilson renormalization group (RG) to supersymmetric theories.
As this regularization scheme preserves supersymmetry, we exploit the
superspace technique. To set up the formalism we first derive the RG flow for
the massless Wess-Zumino model and deduce its perturbative expansion. We then
consider N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills and show that the local gauge symmetry
-broken by the regularization- can be recovered by a suitable choice of the RG
flow boundary conditions. We restrict our analysis to the first loop, the
generalization to higher loops presenting no difficulty due to the iterative
nature of the procedure. Furthermore, adding matter fields, we reproduce the
one-loop supersymmetric chiral anomaly to the second order in the vector field.
