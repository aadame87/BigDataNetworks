  Dvali and Shifman have proposed a field-theoretic mechanism for localizing
gauge fields to "branes" in higher dimensional spaces using confinement in a
bulk gauge theory. The resulting objects have a number of qualitative features
in common with string theory D-branes; they support a gauge field and flux
strings can end on them. In this letter, we explore this analogy further, by
considering what happens when N of these "branes" approach each other. Unlike
in the case of D-branes, we find a reduction of the gauge symmetry as the
"branes" overlap. This can be attributed to a tachyonic instability of the flux
string stretching between the branes.
