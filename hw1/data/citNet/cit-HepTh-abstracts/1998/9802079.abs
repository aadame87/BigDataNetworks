  In a short review of recent work, we discuss the general problem of
constructing the actions of new conformal field theories from old conformal
field theories. Such a construction follows when the old conformal field theory
admits new conformal stress tensors in its chiral algebra, and it turns out
that the new conformal field theory is generically a new spin-two gauge theory.
As an example we discuss the new spin-two gauged sigma models which arise in
this fashion from the general conformal non-linear sigma model.
