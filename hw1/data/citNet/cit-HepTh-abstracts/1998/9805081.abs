  I show that de Sitter space disintegrates into an infinite number of copies
of itself. This occurs iteratively through a quantum process involving two
types of topology change. First a handle is created semiclassically, on which
multiple black hole horizons form. Then the black holes evaporate and
disappear, splitting the spatial hypersurfaces into large parts. Applied to
cosmology, this process leads to the production of a large or infinite number
of universes in most models of inflation and yields a new picture of global
structure.
