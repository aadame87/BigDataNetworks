  We consider a classical field configuration, corresponding to intersection of
two domain walls in a supersymmetric model, where the field profile for two
parallel walls at a finite separation is known explicitly. An approximation to
the solution for intersecting walls is constructed for a small angle at the
intersection. We find a finite effective length of the intersection region and
also an energy, associated with the intersection.
