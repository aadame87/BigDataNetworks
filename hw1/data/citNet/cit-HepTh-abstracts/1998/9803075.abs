  I discuss the general principles underlying quantum field theory, and attempt
to identify its most profound consequences. The deepest of these consequences
result from the infinite number of degrees of freedom invoked to implement
locality. I mention a few of its most striking successes, both achieved and
prospective. Possible limitations of quantum field theory are viewed in the
light of its history.
