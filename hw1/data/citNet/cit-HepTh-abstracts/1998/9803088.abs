  We develop a matrix model for the SO(32) Heterotic string with certain Wilson
lines on the lightlike circle. This is done by using appropriate T-dualities.
The method works for an infinite number of Wilson lines, but not for all. The
matrix model is the theory on the D-string of type I wrapped on a circle with a
SO(32) Wilson line on the circle. The radius of the circle depends on the
Wilson line. This is a 1+1 dimensional O(N) theory on a circle. N depends not
only on the momentum around the lightlike circle but also on the winding and
SO(32) quantum numbers of the state. Perspectives for obtaining a matrix model
for all Wilson lines are discussed.
