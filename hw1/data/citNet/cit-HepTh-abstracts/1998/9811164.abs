  We calculate the zero point energy of a massive scalar field in the
background of an infinitely thin spherical shell given by a potential of the
delta function type. We use zeta functional regularization and express the
regularized ground state energy in terms of the Jost function of the related
scattering problem. Then we find the corresponding heat kernel coefficients and
perform the renormalization, imposing the normalization condition that the
ground state energy vanishes when the mass of the quantum field becomes large.
Finally the ground state energy is calculated numerically. Corresponding plots
are given for different values of the strength of the background potential, for
both attractive and repulsive potentials.
