  String dynamics near the photon sphere in Schwarzschild spacetime is
considered on the basis of a perturbative approach with respect to a rescaled
string tension as a small parameter. The perturbative string solution in the
zeroth and first approximation is presented. The perturbative solution
corresponds to a small deformations of the photon sphere in Schwarzschild
spacetime.
