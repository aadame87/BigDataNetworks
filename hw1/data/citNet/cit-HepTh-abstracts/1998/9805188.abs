  We consider SU(N) QCD_{1+1} coupled to massless adjoint Majorana fermions,
where N is finite but arbitrary. We examine the spectrum for various values of
N, paying particular attention to the formation of multi-particle states, which
were recently identified by Gross, Hashimoto and Klebanov in the N -> infinity
limit of the theory. It is believed that in the limit of vanishing fermion
mass, there is a transition from confinement to screening in which string-like
states made out of adjoint fermion bits dissociate into stable constituent
``single particles''. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that such a
transition into stable constituent particles occurs not only at large N, but
for any finite value of N. In addition, we discuss certain issues concerning
the ``topological'' properties exhibited by the DLCQ spectrum.
