  We discuss some aspects of the physics of branes in the presence of
orientifolds and the corresponding worldvolume gauge dynamics. We show that at
strong coupling orientifolds sometimes turn into bound states of orientifolds
and branes, and give a worldsheet argument for the flip of the sign of an
orientifold plane split into two disconnected parts by an NS fivebrane. We also
describe the moduli space of vacua of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with
symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups, and analyze a set of four dimensional
N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with chiral matter content using branes.
