  We present Wess-Zumino actions for general IIA D-p-branes in explicit forms.
We perform the covariant and irreducible separation of the fermionic
constraints of IIA D-p-branes into the first class and the second class. A
necessary condition which guarantees this separation is discussed. The
generators of the local supersymmetry (kappa symmetry) and the kappa algebra
are obtained. We also explicitly calculate the conserved charge of the global
supersymmetry (SUSY) and the SUSY algebra which contains topological charges.
