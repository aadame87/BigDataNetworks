  In this paper we consider brane solutions of the form $G/H$ in M(atrix)
theory, showing the emergence of world volume coordinates for the cases where
$G=SU(N)$. We examine a particular solution with a world volume geometry of the
form ${\bf CP}^2 \times S^1$ in some detail and show how a smooth manifold
structure emerges in the large $N$ limit. In this limit the solution becomes
static; it is not supersymmetric but is part of a supersymmetric set of
configurations. Supersymmetry in small locally flat regions can be obtained,
but this is not globally defined. A general group theoretic analysis of the
previously known spherical membrane solutions is also given.
