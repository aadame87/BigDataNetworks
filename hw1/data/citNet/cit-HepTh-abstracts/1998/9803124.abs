  Limits of a system of N Dn-branes in which the bulk and string degrees of
freedom decouple to leave a `matter' theory are investigated and, for n>4,
either give a free theory or require taking $N \to \infty$. The decoupled
matter theory is described at low energies by the $N \to \infty$ limit of n+1
dimensional \sym, and at high energies by a free type II string theory in a
curved space-time. Metastable bound states of D6-branes with mass $M$ and
D0-branes with mass $m$ are shown to have an energy proportional to
$M^{1/3}m^{2/3}$ and decouple, whereas in matrix theory they only decouple in
the large N limit.
