  This work presents a first study of a radiative calculation for the
gravitational axial anomaly in the massless Abelian Higgs model. The two loop
contribution to the anomalous correlation function of one axial current and two
energy-momentum tensors, <A_alpha(z) T_\mu\nu(y) T_\rho\sigma(x)>, is computed
at an order that involves only internal matter fields. Conformal properties of
massless field theories are used in order to perform the Feynman diagram
calculations in the coordinate space representation. The two loop contribution
is found not to vanish, due to the presence of two independent tensor
structures in the anomalous correlator.
