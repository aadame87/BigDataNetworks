  We study the two-dimensional Eguchi-Kawai model as a toy model of the IIB
matrix model, which has been recently proposed as a nonperturbative definition
of the type IIB superstring theory. While the planar limit of the model is
known to reproduce the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we find through Monte
Carlo simulation that the model allows a different large N limit, which can be
considered as the double scaling limit in matrix models.
