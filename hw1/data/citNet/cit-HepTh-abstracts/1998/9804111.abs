  We explore the connection between anti-deSitter supergravity and gauge
theory, in the context of bound states of many D1 and D5 branes. The
near-horizon $AdS_3$ supergravity describes the identity sector of the
conformal field theory produced by the brane dynamics. A variant of anomaly
inflow (for the 2d conformal anomaly) is involved. Dynamical matter fields on
$AdS_3$ couple to the chiral ring and its descendant fields on the branes. We
propose a map between boundary conformal field theory and bulk
supergravity/matter dynamics, which is strongly reminiscent of matrix models of
2d gravity.
