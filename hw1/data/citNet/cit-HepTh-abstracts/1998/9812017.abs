  We discuss dilatonic gravity (bulk theory) from the point of view of
(generalized) AdS/CFT correspondence. Self-consistent dilatonic background is
considered. It may be understood as two boundaries space where AdS boundary
appears as infinite boundary and new (singular) boundary occurs at short
distances. The two-point correlation function and conformal dimension for
minimal and dilaton coupled scalar are found. Even for minimal scalar, the
conformal dimension is found to be different on above two boundaries. Hence,
new CFT appears in AdS/CFT correspondence at short distances. AdS/CFT
correspondence may be understood as interpolating bulk theory between two
different CFTs.
