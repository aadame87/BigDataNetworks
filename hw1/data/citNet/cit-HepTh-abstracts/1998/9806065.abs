  We compute -in the saddle point approximation- the partition function for the
2+1 black hole using the Gibbons-Hawking approach. Some issues concerning the
definition of thermodynamical ensembles are clarified. It is pointed out that
the right action in covariant form is exactly equal to the Chern-Simons action
with no added boundary terms. This action is finite, yields the right canonical
free energy and has an extremum when the temperature and angular velocity are
fixed. The correspondence with a 1+1 $CFT$ is indicated.
