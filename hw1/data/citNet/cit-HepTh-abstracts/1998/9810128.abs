Title: On The Field Theory Limit Of D-Instantons
Authors: Hirosi Ooguri (UCB/LBNL) and Kostas Skenderis (Spinoza Institute)
Comments: Major revision; supersymmetry in Euclidean space re-examined. New
  conclusions: (1) the supersymmetry is not enhanced in the field theory limit.
  (2) the theory becomes free type IIB string theory in the large N limit, but
  the limit is not uniform. 9 pages, LaTeX

  We study the dilaton/axion configuration near D-instantons in type IIB
superstring theory. In the field theory limit, the metric near the instantons
becomes flat in the string frame as well as in the Einstein frame. In the large
N limit, the string coupling constant becomes zero except near the origin. The
supersymmetry of this configuration is analyzed. An implication of this result
to the IIB Matrix Model is discussed.
