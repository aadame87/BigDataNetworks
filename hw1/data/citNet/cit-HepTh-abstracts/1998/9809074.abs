  We apply the method of angular quantization to calculation of the wave
function renormali- zation constants in $D_{l}^{(1)}$ affine Toda quantum field
theories. A general formula for the wave function renormalization constants in
ADE Toda field theories is proposed. We also calculate all one-particle form
factors and some of the two-particle form factors of an exponential field.
