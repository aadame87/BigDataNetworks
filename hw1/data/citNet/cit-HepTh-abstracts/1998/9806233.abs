  We solve exactly the (linear order) equations for tensor and scalar
perturbations over the homogeneous, isotropic, open pre-big bang model recently
discussed by several authors. We find that the parametric amplification of
vacuum fluctuations (i.e. particle production) remains negligible throughout
the perturbative pre-big bang phase.
