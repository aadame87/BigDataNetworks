  The randomly driven Navier-Stokes equation without pressure in d-dimensional
space is considered as a model of strong turbulence in a compressible fluid. We
derive a closed equation for the velocity-gradient probability density
function. We find the asymptotics of this function for the case of the gradient
velocity field (Burgers turbulence), and provide a numerical solution for the
two-dimensional case. Application of these results to the velocity-difference
probability density function is discussed.
