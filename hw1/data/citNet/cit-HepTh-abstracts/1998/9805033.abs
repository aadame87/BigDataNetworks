Title: (2+1)-Dimensional QED, Anomalous Surface-Term Contributions and
  Superconductivity
Author: Mu-in Park (MIT & LNS)
Comments: Application to high-T_c superconductivity is noted
Report-no: MIT-CTP-2750
\\
  It is shown that (2+1)-dimensional QED reveals several unusual effects due to
the surface-term contributions. It is also shown that this system provides a
new pairing mechanism for the high-$T_c$ superconductivity on the plane.
