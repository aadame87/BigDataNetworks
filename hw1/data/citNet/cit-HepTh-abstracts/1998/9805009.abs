  The Hamiltonian formulation for the mechanical systems with
reparametrization-invariant Lagrangians, depending on the worldline external
curvatures is given, which is based on the use of moving frame.
  A complete sets of constraints are found for the Lagrangians with quadratic
dependence on curvatures, for the lagrangians, proportional to an arbitrary
curvature, and for the Lagrangians, linear on the first and second curvatures.
