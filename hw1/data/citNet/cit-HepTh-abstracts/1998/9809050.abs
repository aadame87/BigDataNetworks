  When dealing with zeta-function regularized functional determinants of matrix
valued differential operators, an additional term, overlooked until now and due
to the multiplicative anomaly, may arise. The presence and physical relevance
of this term is discussed in the case of a charged bosonic field at finite
charge density and other possible applications are mentioned.
