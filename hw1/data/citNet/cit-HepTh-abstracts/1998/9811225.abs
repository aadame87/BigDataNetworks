  The bosonized Chiral Schwinger model (CSM) is quantized on the light-front
(LF). The physical Hilbert space of CSM is obtained directly once the
constraints on the LF phase space are eliminated. The discussion of the
degenerate vacua and the absence in the CSM of the $\theta$-vacua, as found in
the Schwinger model (SM), becomes straightforward. The differences in the
structures of the the mass excitations and the vacua in these gauge theories
are displayed transparently. The procedure followed is the one used
successfully in the previous works for describing the spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SSB) and the SM on the LF. The physical contents following from the
LF quantized theory agree with those known in the conventional treatment. The
LF hyperplane is argued to be equally appropriate as the conventional
equal-time one for the canonical quantization. Some comments on the
irrelevance, in quantized field theory, of the fact that the hyperplanes
$x^{\pm}=0$ constitute characteristic surfaces of hyperbolic partial
differential equation are also made.
