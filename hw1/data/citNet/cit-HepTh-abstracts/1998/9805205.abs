  I discuss two novel results in D=11 Supergravity. The first establishes, in
two complementary ways, a no-go theorem that, in contrast to all D<11, a
cosmological extension of the theory does not exist. The second deals with the
structure of (on-shell) four-point invariants. These are important both for
establishing existence of the lowest (2-loop) order candidate counter-terms in
the theory proper, as well as for comparison with the form of eventual
"zero-slope" QFT limit of M-theory.
