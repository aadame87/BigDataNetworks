  We study the structure of minimal-energy solutions of the baby Skyrme models
for any topological charge n; the baby multi-skyrmions. Unlike in the (3+1)D
nuclear Skyrme model, a potential term must be present in the (2+1)D Skyrme
model to ensure stability. The form of this potential term has a crucial effect
on the existence and structure of baby multi-skyrmions. The simplest
holomorphic model has no known stable minimal-energy solution for n greater
than one. The other baby Skyrme model studied in the literature possesses
non-radially symmetric minimal-energy configurations that look like `skyrmion
lattices' formed by skyrmions with n=2. We discuss a baby Skyrme model with a
potential that has two vacua. Surprisingly, the minimal-energy solution for
every n is radially-symmetric and the energy grows linearly for large n.
Further, these multi-skyrmions are tighter bound, have less energy and the same
large r behaviour than in the model with one vacuum. We rely on numerical
studies and approximations to test and verify this observation.
