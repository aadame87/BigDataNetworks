  We discuss alternative descriptions of four-dimensional self-dual Yang-Mills
fields in harmonic space with additional commuting spinor coordinates. In
particular, the linear analyticity equation and nonlinear covariant
harmonic-field equations are studied. A covariant harmonic field can be treated
as an infinite set of ordinary four-dimensional fields with higher spins. We
analyze different constructions of invariant harmonic-field actions
corresponding to the self-dual harmonic equations.
