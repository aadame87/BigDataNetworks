  Exact results from random matrix theory are used to systematically analyse
the relationship between microscopic Dirac spectra and finite-volume partition
functions. Results are presented for the unitary ensemble, and the chiral
analogs of the three classical matrix ensembles: unitary, orthogonal and
symplectic, all of which describe universality classes of $SU(N_c)$ gauge
theories with $N_f$ fermions in different representations. Random matrix theory
universality is reconsidered in this new light.
