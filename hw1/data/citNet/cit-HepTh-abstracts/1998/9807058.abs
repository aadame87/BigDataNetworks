  In this work we have constructed the most general action for a set of complex
homogeneous scalar supermultiplets interacting with the scale factor in the
supersymmetric FRW model. It is shown, that local conformal time supersymmetry
leads to the scalar fields potential, which is defined in the same combination:
K\"ahler potential and superpotential as in supergravity (or effective
superstring) theories. This scalar fields potential depends on arbitrary
parameter $\alpha$, which is not fixed by conformal time supersymmetry.
