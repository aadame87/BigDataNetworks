  Differential equations for scaling relation of prepotential in N=2
supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills theory coupled with massive matter
hypermultiplet are proposed and are explicitly demonstrated in one flavour
($N_f =1$) theory. By applying Whitham dynamics, the first order derivative of
the prepotential over the $T_0$ variable corresponding to the mass of the
hypermultiplet, which has a line integral representation, is found to satisfy a
differential equation. As the result, the closed form of this derivative can be
obtained by solving this equation. In this way, the scaling relation of massive
prepotential is established. Furthermore, as an application of another
differential equation for the massive scaling relation, the massive
prepotential in strong coupling region is derived.
