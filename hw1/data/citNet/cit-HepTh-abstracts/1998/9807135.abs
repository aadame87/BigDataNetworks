  In the strong coupling limit type IIA superstring theory develops an eleventh
dimension that is not apparent in perturbation theory. This suggests the
existence of a consistent 11d quantum theory, called M theory, which is
approximated by 11d supergravity at low energies. In this review we describe
some of the evidence for this picture and some of its implications.
