  The large $N_c$ limit of Yang-Mills gauge theory is the dynamics of a closed
gluonic chain, but this fact does not obviate the inherently strong coupling
nature of the dynamical problem. However, we suggest that a single link in such
a chain might be reasonably described in the quasi-perturbative language of
gluons and their interactions. To implement this idea, we use the MIT bag to
model the physics of a nearest neighbor bond.
