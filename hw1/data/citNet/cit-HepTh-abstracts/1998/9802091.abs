  According to the Matrix theory proposal of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and
Susskind M-theory in the infinite momentum frame is the large N limit of super
Yang-Mills theory in a flat background. To address some physical issues of
classical gravity such as gravitational collapse and cosmological expansion we
consider an extension of the BFSS proposal by defining M-theory in curved space
as the large N limit of super Yang-Mills theory in a curved background.
Motivations and possible implications of this extension are discussed.
