  This paper is dedicated to formulate the interaction picture dynamics of the
self-dual field minimally coupled to fermions. To make this possible, we start
by quantizing the free self-dual model by means of the Dirac bracket
quantization procedure. We obtain, as result, that the free self-dual model is
a relativistically invariant quantum field theory whose excitations are
identical to the physical (gauge invariant) excitations of the free
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. The model describing the interaction of the
self-dual field minimally coupled to fermions is also quantized through the
Dirac bracket quantization procedure. One of the self-dual field components is
found not to commute, at equal times, with the fermionic fields. Hence, the
formulation of the interaction picture dynamics is only possible after the
elimination of the just mentioned component. This procedure brings, in turns,
two new interaction terms, which are local in space and time while
non-renormalizable by power counting. Relativistic invariance is tested in
connection with the elastic fermion-fermion scattering amplitude. We prove that
all the non-covariant pieces in the interaction Hamiltonian are equivalent to
the covariant minimal interaction of the self-dual field with the fermions. The
high energy behavior of the self-dual field propagator corroborates that the
coupled theory is non-renormalizable. Certainly, the self-dual field minimally
coupled to fermions bears no resemblance with the renormalizable model defined
by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons field minimally coupled to fermions.
