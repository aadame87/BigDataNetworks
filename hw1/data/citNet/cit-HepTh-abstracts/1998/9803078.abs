  Recently a method has been developed for relating four dimensional
Schwarzschild black holes in M-theory to near-extremal black holes in string
theory with four charges, using suitably defined ``boosts'' and T-dualities. We
show that this method can be extended to obtain the emission rate of low energy
massless scalars for the four dimensional Schwarzschild hole from the
microscopic picture of radiation from the near extremal hole.
