  We analyze short and long multiplets which appear in the OPE expansion of
``chiral'' primary operators in N=4 Super Yang--Mills theory. Among them,
higher spin long and new short multiplets appear, having the interpretation, in
the AdS/CFT correspondence, of string states and supergravity multiparticle
states respectively. We also analyze the decomposition of long multiplets under
N=1 supersymmetry, as a possible tool to explore other supersymmetric
deformations of IIB string on AdS_5 x S_5.
