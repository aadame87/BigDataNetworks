  We compute the amount of inflation required to solve the horizon problem of
cosmology in the pre-big-bang scenario. First we give a quick overview of
string cosmology as developed by Veneziano and collaborators. Then we show that
the amount of inflation in this background solves the horizon problem. We
discuss fine-tuning.
