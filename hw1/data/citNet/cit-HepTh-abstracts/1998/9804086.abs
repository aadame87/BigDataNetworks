Title: Some remarks on Whitham equations
Author: Robert Carroll (UIUC)
Comments: Latex, 26 pages. Some typos corrected and clarification provided
\\
  A number of formulas are displayed concerning Whitham theory for a simple
example of pure N=2 susy YM with gauge group SU(2). In particular this serves
to illuminate the role of Lambda and T derivatives and the interaction with
prepotentials F based on Seiberg-Witten and Whitham theory.
