  Extending recent work of Kachru and Silverstein, we consider ``orbifolds'' of
4-dimensional $\CN=4$ SU(n) super-Yang-Mills theories with respect to discrete
subgroups of the SU(4) $R$-symmetry which act nontrivially on the gauge group.
We show that for every discrete subgroup of SU(4) there is a canonical choice
of imbedding of the discrete group in the gauge group which leads to theories
with a vanishing one-loop beta-function. We conjecture that these give rise to
(generically non-supersymmetric) conformal theories. The gauge group is
$\otimes_i SU(Nn_i)$ where $n_i$ denote the dimension of the irreducible
representations of the corresponding discrete group; there is also
bifundamental matter, dictated by associated quiver diagrams. The interactions
can also be read off from the quiver diagram. For SU(3) and SU(2) subgroups
this leads to superconformal theories with $\CN=1$ and $\CN=2$ respectively. In
the $\CN=1$ case we prove the vanishing of the beta functions to two loops.
