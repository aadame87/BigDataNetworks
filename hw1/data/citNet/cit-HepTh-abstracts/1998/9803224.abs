  In the framework of N=1 supersymmetric string models given by the heterotic
string on an elliptic Calabi-Yau $\pi :Z\ra B$ together with a SU(n) bundle we
compute the chiral matter content of the massless spectrum. For this purpose
the net generation number, i.e. half the third Chern class, is computed from
data related to the heterotic vector bundle in the spectral cover description;
a non-technical introduction to that method is supplied. This invariant is, in
the class of bundles considered, shown to be related to a discrete modulus
which is the heterotic analogue of the $F$-theory four-flux. We consider also
the relevant matter which is supported along certain curves in the base $B$ and
derive the net generation number again from the independent matter-related
computation. We then illustrate these considerations with two applications.
First we show that the construction leads to numerous 3 generation models of
unbroken gauge group $SU(5), SO(10)$ or $E_6$. Secondly we discuss the closely
related issue of the heterotic 5-brane/instanton transition resp. the
F-theoretic 3-brane/instanton transition. The extra chiral matter in these
transitions is related to the Hecke transform of the direct sum of the original
bundle and the dissolved 5-brane along the intersection of their spectral
covers. Finally we point to the corresponding $F$-theory interpretation of
chiral matter from the intersection of 7-branes where the influence of
four-flux on the twisting along the intersection curve plays a crucial role.
