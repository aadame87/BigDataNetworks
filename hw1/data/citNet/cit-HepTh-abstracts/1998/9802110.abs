  A natural combined model of the Kerr spinning particle and superparticle is
obtained leading to a non-trivial super black hole solution. By analogue with
complex structure of the Kerr solution we perform a supershift on the Kerr
geometry, and then select a "body"-submanifold of superspace that yields a
non-trivial supergeneralization of the Kerr metric with a nonlinear
realization of (2,0)-supersymmetry. For the known parameters of spinning
particles this "black hole" is to be in a specific state without horizons and
very far from extreme. The naked Kerr singular ring has to be hidden inside a
rotating superconducting disk, built of a supermultiplet of matter fields.
Stringy wave excitations of the Kerr singular ring (traveling waves) yield an
extra axial singular line modulated by de Broglie periodicity.
