Title: Parity-Conserving Light-Cone Quantization of Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Ovid C. Jacob
Comments: 12 pages, phyzzx, SLAC-PUB-6188
\\
  Parity violation is a long standing problem in light-cone quantization.
\REF\CPT{D. Soper, SLAC-REP-137, 1970, Chap. I . } \refend We propose a new
quantization on the light-cone which treats both the $x^{+}$ and the $x^{-}$
coordinates as light-cone 'times.'This quantization respects both parity and
time-reversal. We find that now both $P^{-}$ and $P^{+}$ become dynamical.
