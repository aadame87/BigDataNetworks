  We study perturbatively the (conformal) WZNW model. At one loop we compute
one-particle irreducible two- and three-point current correlation functions,
both in the conventional version and in the classically equivalent, chiral,
nonlocal, induced version of the model. At two loops we compute the two-point
function and find that it vanishes (modulo infrared-induced logarithms). We use
dimensional regularization and the $R^*$ operation for removing infrared
divergences. The outcome of the calculations is insensitive to the treatment of
the $\varepsilon^{\m\n}$ tensor as a two-dimensional or $d$-dimensional object.
Our results indicate that the one-particle irreducible current correlation
functions constitute an effective action equal to the original WZNW action with
the familiar level shift, $k\to k+\tilde h$.
