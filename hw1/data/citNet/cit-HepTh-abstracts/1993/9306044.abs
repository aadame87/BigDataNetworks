  We classify the operator content of local hermitian scalar operators in the
Sinh-Gordon model by means of independent solutions of the form-factor
bootstrap equations. The corresponding linear space is organized into a
tower-like structure of dimension $n$ for the form factors $F_{2n}$ and
$F_{2n-1}$. Analyzing the cluster property of the form factors, a particular
class of these solutions can be identified with the matrix elements of the
operators $e^{k g\phi}$. We also present the complete expression of the form
factors of the elementary field $\phi(x)$ and the trace of the energy-momentum
tensor $\Theta(x)$.
