  The conjecture that $N=2$ minimal models in two dimensions are critical
points of a super-renormalizable Landau-Ginzburg model can be tested by
computing the path integral of the Landau-Ginzburg model with certain twisted
boundary conditions. This leads to simple expressions for certain characters of
the $N=2$ models which can be verified at least at low levels. An $N=2$
superconformal algebra can in fact be found directly in the {\it noncritical}
Landau-Ginzburg system, giving further support for the conjecture.
