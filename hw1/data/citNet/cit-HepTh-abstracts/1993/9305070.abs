  We study classical $N=2$ super-$W_3$ algebra and its interplay with $N=2$
supersymmetric extensions of the Boussinesq equation in the framework of the
nonlinear realization method and the inverse Higgs - covariant reduction
approach. These techniques have been previously applied by us in the bosonic
$W_3$ case to give a new geometric interpretation of the Boussinesq hierarchy.
Here we deduce the most general $N=2$ super Boussinesq equation and two kinds
of the modified $N=2$ super Boussinesq equations, as well as the super Miura
maps relating these systems to each other, by applying the covariant reduction
to certain coset manifolds of linear $N=2$ super-$W_3^{\infty}$ symmetry
associated with $N=2$ super-$W_3$. We discuss the integrability properties of
the equations obtained and their correspondence with the formulation based on
the notion of the second hamiltonian structure.
