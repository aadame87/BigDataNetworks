  We define a block observable for the $q$-state Potts model which exhibits an
intermittent behaviour at the critical point. We express the intermittency
indices of the normalised moments in terms of the magnetic critical exponent
$\beta /\nu$ of the model. We confirm this relation by a numerical similation
of the $q=2$ (Ising) and $q=3$ two-dimensional Potts model.
