  Loop equations of matrix models express the invariance of the models under
field redefinitions. We use loop equations to prove that it is possible to
define continuum times for the generic hermitian {1-matrix} model such that all
correlation functions in the double scaling limit agree with the corresponding
correlation functions of the Kontsevich model expressed in terms of kdV times.
In addition the double scaling limit of the partition function of the hermitian
matrix model agree with the $\tau$-function of the kdV hierarchy corresponding
to the Kontsevich model (and not the square of the $\tau$-function) except for
some complications at genus zero.
