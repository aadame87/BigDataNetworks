  Pairing between the universal enveloping algebra $U_q(sl(2))$ and the algebra
of functions over $SL_q(2)$ is obtained in explicit terms. The regular
representation of the quantum double is constructed and investigated. The
structure of the root subspaces of the Casimir operator is revealed and
described in terms of $SL_q(2)$ elements.
