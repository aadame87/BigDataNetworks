  We discuss a generalization of the quantum group $\su$ to the $q$-Virasoro
algebra in two-dimensional electrons system under uniform magnetic field. It is
shown that the integral representations of both algebras are reduced to those
in a (1+1)-dimensional fermion. As an application of the quantum group
symmetry, we discuss a model of quantum group current on the analogy of the
Hall current.
