  This is mainly a brief review of some key achievements in a `hot'' area of
theoretical and mathematical physics. The principal aim is to outline the basic
structures underlying {\em integrable} quantum field theory models with {\em
infinite-dimensional} symmetry groups which display a radically new type of
{\em quantum group} symmetries. Certain particular aspects are elaborated upon
with some detail: integrable systems of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili type and their
reductions appearing in matrix models of strings; Hamiltonian approach to
Lie-Poisson symmetries; quantum field theory approach to two-dimensional
relativistic integrable models with dynamically broken conformal invariance.
All field-theoretic models in question are of primary relevance to diverse
branches of physics ranging from nonlinear hydrodynamics to string theory of
fundamental particle interactions at ultra-high energies.
