  We discuss in detail how string-inspired lineal gravity can be formulated as
a gauge theory based on the centrally extended Poincar\'e group in $(1+1)$
dimensions. Matter couplings are constructed in a gauge invariant fashion, both
for point particles and Fermi fields. A covariant tensor notation is developed
in which gauge invariance of the formalism is manifest.
