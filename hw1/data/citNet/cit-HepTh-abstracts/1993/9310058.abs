Title: Massless integrable quantum field theories and massless scattering in
  1+1 dimensions
Authors: P. Fendley and H. Saleur
Comments: 30 pages + 2 figs included
Report-no: USC-93-022
\\
  These lecture notes provide an elementary introduction to the study of
massless integrable quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions using ``massless
scattering''. Some previously unpublished results are also presented, including
a non-perturbative study of Virasoro conserved quantities.
