  We analyze a formulation of QED based on the Wilson renormalization group.
Although the ``effective Lagrangian'' used at any given scale does not have
simple gauge symmetry, we show that the resulting renormalized Green's
functions correctly satisfies Ward identities to all orders in perturbation
theory. The loop expansion is obtained by solving iteratively the Polchinski's
renormalization group equation. We also give a new simple proof of perturbative
renormalizability. The subtractions in the Feynman graphs and the corresponding
counterterms are generated in the process of fixing the physical conditions.
