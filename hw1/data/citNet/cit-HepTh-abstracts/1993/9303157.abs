  We study the two-matrix model which represents the sum over closed and open
random surfaces coupled to an Ising Model. The boundary conditions are
characterized by the fact that the Ising spins sitting at the vertices of the
boundaries are all in the same state. We obtain the string equation and discuss
the results. (No change in physics, only some misprints are corrected)
