  The symmetries of the topological Yang-Mills theory are studied in the
Hamiltonian formalism and the generators of the twisted N=2 superPoincar\'e
algebra are explicitly constructed. Noting that the twisted Lorentz generators
do not generate the Lorentz symmetry of the theory, we relate the two by
extracting from the latter the twisted version of the internal SU(2) generator.
The hermiticity properties of the various generators are also considered
throughout, and the boost generators are found to be non-hermitian. We then
recover the BRST cohomology condition on physical states from representation
theory arguments.
