Title: Quantum Canonical Transformations and Integrability: Beyond Unitary
  Transformations
Authors: Arlen Anderson
Comments: 15 pages, LaTeX, Imperial-TP-92-93-19 [Revision consists of new
  material on observables and an explanation of how the proposed definition of
  integrability allows for systems which have fewer commuting integrals of the
  motion than degrees of freedom.]

  Quantum canonical transformations are defined in analogy to classical
canonical transformations as changes of the phase space variables which
preserve the Dirac bracket structure. In themselves, they are neither unitary
nor non-unitary. A definition of quantum integrability in terms of canonical
transformations is proposed which includes systems which have fewer commuting
integrals of motion than degrees of freedom. The important role of non-unitary
transformations in integrability is discussed.
