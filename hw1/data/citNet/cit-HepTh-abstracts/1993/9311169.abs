Title: Convergent WKB Series
Authors: David T. Barclay
Comments: 9 pages, UICHEP-TH/93-16
\\
  A set of simple exactly solvable potentials are shown to have convergent WKB
series. The resulting all-orders quantisation conditions provide a unified
description of all known cases where an exact WKB quantisation condition has
been obtained by modifying the potential with Langer-style terms, together with
several new examples.
