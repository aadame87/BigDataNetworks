  Reported are two applications of the functional relations ($T$-system) among
a commuting family of row-to-row transfer matrices proposed in the previous
paper Part I. For a general simple Lie algebra $X_r$, we determine the
correlation lengths of the associated massive vertex models in the
anti-ferroelectric regime and central charges of the RSOS models in two
critical regimes. The results reproduce known values or even generalize them,
demonstrating the efficiency of the $T$-system.
