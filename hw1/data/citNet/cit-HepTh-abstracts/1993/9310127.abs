  We study a dynamically broken U(1) "left" gauge theory endowed with a
composite scalar doublet (one scalar and one pseudoscalar); its Lagrangian only
differs from that of an abelian `Standard Model' by the addition of a
derivative coupling between a Wess-Zumino field, linked to the previous
scalars, and the fermionic current. Yet, in the Feynman path integral, the non
independence of the fermionic and scalar variables of integration requires the
introduction of constraints. When the gauge symmetry is broken by the vacuum
expectation value of the scalar field, they freeze all degrees of freedom but
those of a massive gauge field, including a (abelian) pion. The anomaly
disappears and the gauge current is conserved. This is shown, and
renormalizability studied, in the `Nambu-Jona-Lasinio approximation'. Unitarity
is demonstrated on general grounds.
