  Recent work on the classification of conformal field theories with one
primary field (the identity operator) is reviewed. The classification of such
theories is an essential step in the program of classification of all rational
conformal field theories, but appears impossible in general. The last managable
case, central charge 24, is considered here. We found a total of 71 such
theories (which have not all been constructed yet) including the monster
module. The complete list of modular invariant partition functions has already
appeared elsewhere \SchM. This paper contains an easily readable account of the
method, as well as a few examples and some comments. (This is a compilation of
contributions to workshops in Goteborg, Kiev, Corfu and Erice).
