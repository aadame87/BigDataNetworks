  A self-consistent string field theory with interaction is formulated. The
symmetry algebra of this theory includes, in the low-energy limit, local
space-time symmetries, and the Brans-Dicke equation describes a class of
low-energy solutions. (Talk given at the conference Journees Relativistes'93
held on April 5-7 1993, To be published in the International Journal of Modern
Physics D.)
