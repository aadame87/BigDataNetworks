Title: Helicity in Classical Electrodynamics and Turbulence
Authors: Aleksej V. Chechkin, Dmitrij P. Sorokin and Vladimir V. Yanovsky

\\
  For the electromagnetic fields, hydrodynamic media and turbulent flows we
consider the relationship between a topological characteristic of vector fields
known as helicity and the angular momentum of the medium, and discuss, in this
respect, the problem of helicity and angular momentum transfer from the
electromagnetic field to a medium.
