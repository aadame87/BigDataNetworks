  Non-perturbative effects of instanton-like solutions are studied within the
framework of supergravity theories with field-dependent gauge functions.
Fermionic zero modes are constructed and some typical correlation functions are
evaluated. The effects of instantons are very similar to those in globally
supersymmetric theories: they preserve supersymmetry while breaking a chiral
$U(1)$ symmetry. Non-perturbative amplitudes receive corrections which are
suppressed at large distances.
