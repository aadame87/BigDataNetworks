  The full non-linear structure of the action and transformation rules for
$\W_N$-gravity coupled to matter are obtained from a non-linear truncation of
those for $w_ \infty$ gravity. The geometry of the construction is discussed,
and it is shown that the defining equations become linear after a twistor-like
transform.
