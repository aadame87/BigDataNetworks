  We consider the uncertainty relation between position and momentum of a
particle on $ S^1 $ (a circle). Since $ S^1 $ is compact, the uncertainty of
position must be bounded. Consideration on the uncertainty of position demands
delicate treatment. Recently Ohnuki and Kitakado have formulated quantum
mechanics on $ S^D $ (a $D$-dimensional sphere). Armed with their formulation,
we examine this subject. We also consider parity and find a phenomenon similar
to the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We discuss problems which we encounter
when we attempt to formulate quantum mechanics on a general manifold.
