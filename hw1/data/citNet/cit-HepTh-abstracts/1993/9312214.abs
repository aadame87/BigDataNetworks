  Representations of braid group obtained from rational conformal field
theories can be used to obtain explicit representations of Temperley-Lieb-Jones
algebras. The method is described in detail for SU(2)$_k$ Wess - Zumino
conformal field theories and its generalization to an arbitrary rational
conformal field theory outlined. Explicit definition of an associated linear
trace operation in terms of a certain matrix element in the space of conformal
blocks of such a conformal theory is presented. Further for every primary field
of a rational conformal field theory, there is a subfactor of hyperfinite
II$_1$ factor with trivial relative commutant. The index of the subfactor is
given in terms of identity - identity element of certain duality matrix for
conformal blocks of four-point correlators. Jones formula for index ( $<$ 4 )
for subfactors corresponds to spin ${\frac{1}{2}}$ representation of SU(2)$_k$
Wess-Zumino conformal field theory. Definition of the trace operation also
provides a method of obtaining link invariants explicitly.
