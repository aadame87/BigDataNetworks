  Following a suggestion made by Tseytlin, we investigate the case when one
replaces the transverse part of the bosonic action by an $n=2$ supersymmetric
sigma-model with a symmetric homogeneous K\"ahlerian target space. As
conjectured by Tseytlin, the metric is shown to be exactly known since the beta
function is known to reduce to its one-loop value.
