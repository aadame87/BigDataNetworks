  The Sine-Gordon theory at $\frac{\beta^{2}}{8\pi} = \frac{2}{(2n+3)},\; n=
1,2,3 \cdots $ has a higher spin generalization of the $N=2$ supersymmetry with
the central terms which arises from the affine quantum group $U_{q}( \hat{s
\ell} (2))$. Observing that the algebraic determination of $S$ matrices $(
\approx {\rm quantum~ integrability })$ requires the saturation of the
generalized Bogomolny bound, we construct a variant of the Sine-Gordon theory
at this value of the coupling in the framework of $S$ matrix theory. The
spectrum consists of a doublet of fractionally charged solitons as well as that
of anti-solitons in addition to the ordinary breathers. The construction
demonstrates the existence of the theory other than the one by the truncation
to the breathers considered by Smirnov. The allowed values for the fractional
part of the fermion number is also determined.  The central charge in the
massless limit is found to be $c= 1$ from the TBA calculation for nondiagonal S
matrices.  The attendant $c=1$ conformal field theory is the gaussian model
with ${\bf Z_{2}}$ graded chiral algebra at the radius parameter $r=
\sqrt{2n+3}$. In the course of the calculation, we find $4n+2$ zero modes from
the (anti-)soliton distributions.
