  Abelian anomaly is examined by means of the recently proposed gauge invariant
regularization for SO(10) chiral gauge theory and its generalization for a
theory of arbitrary gauge group with anomaly-free chiral fermion contents. For
both cases it is shown that the anomaly with correct normalization can be
obtained in a gauge invariant form without any counterterms.
