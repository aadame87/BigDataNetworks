  In this paper we consider 1-D non-local field theories with a particular
$1/r^2$ interaction, a constant gauge field and an arbitrary scalar potential.
We show that any such theory that is at a renormalization group fixed point
also satisfies an infinite set of reparametrization invariance Ward identities.
We also prove that, for special values of the gauge field, the value of the
potential that satisfies the Ward identities to first order in the potential
strength remains a solution to all orders in the potential strength, summed
over all loops. These theories are of interest because they describe
dissipative quantum mechanics with an arbitrary potential and a constant
magnetic field. They also give solutions to open string theory in the presence
of a uniform gauge field and an arbitrary tachyon field.
