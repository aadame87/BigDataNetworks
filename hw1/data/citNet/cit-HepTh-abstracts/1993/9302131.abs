  The similarity between tree-level string theory scalar amplitudes, the
Koba-Nielsen form ($S^{1}$) and the Virasoro-Shapiro form ($S^{2}$) suggests a
natural $S^{n}$ generalization for a scalar amplitude. It is shown that the
$S^{n}$ amplitude shares many essential properties of the string theory
amplitudes, including $SO(n+1,1)$ conformal symmetry and linear Regge
trajectories for the mass spectrum. We also discuss factorization and the
critical dimension for the amplitude, which are the necessary conditions for
the quantum mechanical consistency (unitarity) of the amplitude.
