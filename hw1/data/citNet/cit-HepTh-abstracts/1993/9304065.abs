  The S-matrices for non-simply-laced affine Toda field theories are considered
in the context of a generalised bootstrap principle. The S-matrices, and in
particular their poles, depend on a parameter whose range lies between the
Coxeter numbers of dual pairs of the corresponding non-simply-laced algebras.
It is proposed that only odd order poles in the physical strip with positive
coefficients throughout this range should participate in the bootstrap. All
other singularities have an explanation in principle in terms of a generalised
Coleman-Thun mechanism. Besides the S-matrices introduced by Delius, Grisaru
and Zanon, the missing case ($f_4^{(1)},e_6^{(2)}$), is also considered and
provides many interesting examples of pole generation.
