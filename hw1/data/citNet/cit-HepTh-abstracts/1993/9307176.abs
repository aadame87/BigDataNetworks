  Two-dimensional topological field theories possessing a non-abelian current
symmetry are constructed. The topological conformal algebra of these models is
analysed. It differs from the one obtained by twisting the $N=2$ superconformal
models and contains generators of dimensions $1$, $2$ and $3$ that close a
linear algebra. Our construction can be carried out with one and two bosonic
currents and the resulting theories can be interpreted as topological sigma
models for group manifolds
