\\
  In recent work a multimonopole solution of heterotic string theory was
obtained. The monopoles are noted to be stable, in contrast with analogous
solutions of Einstein-Maxwell or Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. The existence of
this and other classes of stable solitonic solutions in string theory thus
provides a possible test for low-energy string theory as distinct from other
gauge + gravity theories.
