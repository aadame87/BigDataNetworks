  We investigate in details how the Virasoro algebra appears in the scaling
limit of the simplest lattice models of XXZ or RSOS type. Our approach is
straightforward but to our knowledge had never been tried so far. We simply
formulate a conjecture for the lattice stress-energy tensor motivated by the
exact derivation of lattice global Ward identities. We then check that the
proper algebraic relations are obeyed in the scaling limit. The latter is under
reasonable control thanks to the Bethe-ansatz solution. The results, which are
mostly numerical for technical reasons, are remarkably precise. They are also
corroborated by exact pieces of information from various sources, in particular
Temperley-Lieb algebra representation theory. Most features of the Virasoro
algebra (like central term, null vectors, metric properties...) can thus be
observed using the lattice models. This seems of general interest for lattice
field theory, and also more specifically for finding relations between
conformal invariance and lattice integrability, since basis for the irreducible
representations of the Virasoro algebra should now follow (at least in
principle) from Bethe-ansatz computations.
