Title: A Topologically Stable Solution in Quantum Electrodynamics

  This paper constructs exact classical solutions of the equations of QED.
These are constructed in 4+2 dimensional space, which fibers over the usual 3+1
dimensional space-time. The solution is stationary and localised about a
topological singularity in space time. The electromagnetic field is that of a
point electric charge, positioned at the singularity. Away from the
singularity, all the conserved currents vanish. The solution comes in 8
varieties, corresponding to any choice of positive or negative charge, spin or
mass (though it is presumed that the negative mass solutions are not physical).
The charge is quantised, and determined up to sign by the coupling constant in
the theory. The main element in the construction is simply the requirement that
the solution be rotationally symmetric.
