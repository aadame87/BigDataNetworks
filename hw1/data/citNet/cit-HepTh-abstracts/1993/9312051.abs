Title: SU(2) WZNW Model at Higher Genera from Gauge Field Functional Integral

  We compute the gauge field functional integral giving the scalar product of
the SU(2) Chern-Simons theory states on a Riemann surface of genus > 1. The
result allows to express the higher genera partition functions of the SU(2)
WZNW conformal field theory by explicit finite dimensional integrals. Our
calculation may also shed new light on the functional integral of the Liouville
theory.
