Title: Quantum Principal Bundles
Authors: Mico Durdevic
Comments: 10 pages, LaTex
\\
  A noncommutative-geometric generalization of the theory of principal bundles
is sketched. A differential calculus over corresponding quantum principal
bundles is analysed. The formalism of connections is presented. In particular,
operators of covariant derivative and horizontal projection are described and
analysed. Quantum counterparts for the Bianchi identity and the Weil's
homomorphism are found. Illustrative examples are considered. (Lecture
presented at the XXII-th Conference on Differential Geometric Methods in
Theoretical Physics, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Mexico, September 1993).
