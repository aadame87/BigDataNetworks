  Brownian motion may be embedded in the Fock space of bosonic free field in
one dimension.Extending this correspondence to a family of creation and
annihilation operators satisfying a q-deformed algebra, the notion of
q-deformation is carried from the algebra to the domain of stochastic
processes.The properties of q-deformed Brownian motion, in particular its
non-Gaussian nature and cumulant structure,are established.
