  We construct the space of vector fields on quantum groups . Its elements are
products of the known left invariant vector fields with the elements of the
quantum group itself. We also study the duality between vector fields and
1-forms. The construction is easily generalized to tensor fields. A Lie
derivative along any (also non left invariant) vector field is proposed. These
results hold for a generic Hopf algebra.
