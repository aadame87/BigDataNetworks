Title: Classical String Solitons
Authors: Ramzi R. Khuri
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We discuss some recent work in the field of classical solitonic solutions in
string theory. In particular, we construct instanton and monopole solutions and
discuss the dynamics of string-like solitons. Some of the motivation behind
this work is that instantons may provide a nonperturbative understanding of the
vacuum structure of string theory, while monopoles may appear in string
predictions for grand unification. The string-like solitons represent extended
states of fundamental strings. The essential role of supersymmetry in both the
saturation of the Bogomol'nyi bound and in the cancellation of higher order
corrections is emphasized. (Talk given at the International Workshop: ``Recent
Advances in the Superworld'', Houston Advanced Research Center, The Woodlands,
