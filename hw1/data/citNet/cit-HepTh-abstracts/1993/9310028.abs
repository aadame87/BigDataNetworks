Title: Resummed Effective Action in Inhomogeneous External Field at Zero and
  Finite Temperature
Authors: A. Leonidov
Comments: BI-TP 93/53, Plain LaTeX
\\
  The two ways of resumming the efffective action for the massless test
particles in inhomogeneous external field at zero and finite temperature
providing the infrared finite answer are discussed. The case of the massive
test particles having a mass which is parametrically small with respect to a
scale set by the inhomogeneous external field is briefly considered.
