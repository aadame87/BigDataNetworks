  We propose a regular way to construct lattice versions of $W$-algebras, both
for quantum and classical cases. In the classical case we write the algebra
explicitly and derive the lattice analogue of Boussinesq equation from the
Hamiltonian equations of motion. Connection between the lattice
Faddeev-Takhtadjan-Volkov algebra [1] and q-deformed Virasoro is also
discussed.
