  It is shown that the application of Lax-Phillips scattering theory to quantum
mechanics provides a natural framework for the realization of the ideas of the
Many-Hilbert-Space theory of Machida and Namiki to describe the development of
decoherence in the process of measurement. We show that if the quantum
mechanical evolution is pointwise in time, then decoherence occurs only if the
Hamiltonian is time-dependent. If the evolution is not pointwise in time (as in
Liouville space), then the decoherence may occur even for closed systems. These
conclusions apply as well to the general problem of mixing of states.
