  It is shown that topological massive gravity augmented by the triadic
gravitational Chern-Simons first order term is a curved a pure spin-2 action.
This model contains two massive spin-2 excitations. However, since its
light-front energy is not semidefinite positive, this double CS-action does not
have any physical relevance.In other words, topological massive gravity cannot
be spontaneously broken down by the presence of the triadic CS term.
