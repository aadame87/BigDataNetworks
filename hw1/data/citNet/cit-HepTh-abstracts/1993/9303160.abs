\\
  Conformal field theories with correlation functions which have logarithmic
singularities are considered. It is shown that those singularities imply the
existence of additional operators in the theory which together with ordinary
primary operators form the basis of the Jordan cell for the operator $L_{0}$.
An example of the field theory possessing such correlation functions is given.
