  We classify positive energy representations with finite degeneracies of
the Lie algebra $W_{1+\infty}\/$ and construct them in terms of
representation theory of the Lie algebra $\hatgl ( \infty R_m )\/$ of
infinite matrices with finite number of non-zero diagonals over the algebra
$R_m = \C [ t ] / ( t^{m + 1} )\/$.  The unitary ones are classified as well.
Similar results are obtained for the sin-algebras.
