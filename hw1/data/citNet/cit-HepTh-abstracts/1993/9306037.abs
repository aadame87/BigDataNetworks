  We derive loop equations for the one-link correlators of gauge and scalar
fields in the Kazakov-Migdal model. These equations determine the solution of
the model in the large N limit and are similar to analogous equations for the
Hermitean two-matrix model. We give an explicit solution of the equations for
the case of a Gaussian, quadratic potential. We also show how similar
calculations in a non-Gaussian case reduce to purely algebraic equations.
