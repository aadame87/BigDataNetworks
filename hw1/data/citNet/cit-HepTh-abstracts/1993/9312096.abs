  We discuss relations of Vafa's quantum cohomology with Floer's homology
theory, introduce equivariant quantum cohomology, formulate some conjectures
about its general properties and, on the basis of these conjectures, compute
quantum cohomology algebras of the flag manifolds. The answer turns out to
coincide with the algebra of regular functions on an invariant lagrangian
variety of a Toda lattice.
