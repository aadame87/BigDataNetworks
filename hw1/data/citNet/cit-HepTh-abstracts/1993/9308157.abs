  This work can be considered as a continuation of our previous one (J.Phys.,
26 (1993) 313), in which an explicit form of coherent states (CS) for all SU(N)
groups was constructed by means of representations on polynomials. Here we
extend that approach to any SU(l,1) group and construct explicitly
corresponding CS. The CS are parametrized by dots of a coset space, which is,
in that particular case, the open complex ball $CD^{l}$. This space together
with the projective space $CP^{l}$, which parametrizes CS of the SU(l+1) group,
exhausts all complex spaces of constant curvature. Thus, both sets of CS
provide a possibility for an explicit analysis of the quantization problem on
all the spaces of constant curvature.
