  Some aspects of the rotating three-dimensional Einstein-Anti-de-Sitter black
hole solution, constructed recently by Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli are
discussed. It is shown explicitly that this black hole represents the most
general black hole type solution of the Einstein-Anti-de-Sitter theory. The
interpretation of one of the integrals of motion as the spin is discussed. Its
physics relies on the topological structure of the black hole manifold, and the
notion of simultaneity of space-like separated intervals. The relationship of
the black hole solution to string theory on a $2 + 1$ dimensional target space
is examined, and it is shown that the black hole can be understood as a part of
the full axion-dilaton-gravity, realized as a WZWN $\sigma $ model. In
conclusion, the pertinence of this solution to four-dimensional black strings
and topologically massive gravity is pointed out.
