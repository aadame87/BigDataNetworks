  The low-energy scattering of charged fermions by extremal magnetic
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes is analyzed in the large-$N$ and $S$-wave
approximations. It is shown that (in these approximations) information is
carried into a causally inaccessible region of spacetime, and thereby
effectively lost. It is also shown that there is an infinite degeneracy of
quantum black hole ground states, or ``remnants", which store --- but will not
reveal --- the information. A notable feature of the analysis --- not shared by
recent analyses of dilatonic black holes --- is that the key physical questions
can be answered within the weak coupling domain. We regard these results as
strong evidence that effective information loss occurs in our universe.
