  We study the electrodynamics of generic charged particles (bosons, fermions,
relativistic or not) constrained to move on an infinite plane. An effective
gauge theory in 2+1 dimensional spacetime which describes the real
electromagnetic interaction of this particles is obtained. The relationship
between this effective theory with the Chern-Simons theory is explored. It is
shown that the QED lagrangian {\it per se} produces the Chern-Simons constraint
relating the current to the effective gauge field in 2+1 D. It is also shown
that the geometry of the system unavoidably induces a contribution from the
topological $\theta$-term that generates an explicit Chern-Simons term for the
effective 2+1 dimensional gauge field as well as a minimal coupling of the
matter to it. The possible relation of the effective three dimensional theory
with the bosonization of the Dirac fermion field in 2+1 D is briefly discussed
as well as the potential applications in Condensed Matter systems.
