  Talk given at the 26th Workshop: ``From Superstrings to Supergravity" Erice -
Sicily, 5-12 December 1992: In this talk we discuss string consistency
requirements on four dimensional string models, namely the cancellation of
target space duality anomalies. The analysis is explicitly performed for
(hypothetical) orbifold models assuming the massless spectrum of the
supersymmetric standard model. In addition, some phenomenological properties of
four-dimensional strings, like the unification of the standard model gauge
coupling constants and soft supersymmetry breaking parameters, are
investigated.
