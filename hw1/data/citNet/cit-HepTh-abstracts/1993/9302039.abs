  We study the quantum $N=2$ super-$W_{3}$ algebra using the free field
realization, which is obtained from the supersymmetric Miura transformation
associated with the Lie superalgebra $A(2|1)$. We compute the full operator
product expansions of the algebra explicitly. It is found that the results
agree with those obtained by the OPE method.
