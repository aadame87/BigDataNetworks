  I discuss some results we have obtained recently in a lattice model for
quantized gravity coupled to scalar matter in four dimensions. We have looked
at how the continuous phase transition separating the smooth from the rough
phase of gravity is influenced by the presence of the scalar field. We find
that close to the critical point, where the average curvature approaches zero,
the effects of the scalar field are small and the coupling of matter to gravity
seems to be weak. The nature of the phase diagram and the values for the
critical exponents would suggest that gravitational interactions increase with
distance.
