  We study a system of functional relations among a commuting family of
row-to-row transfer matrices in solvable lattice models. The role of exact
sequences of the finite dimensional quantum group modules is clarified. We find
a curious phenomenon that the solutions of those functional relations also
solve the so-called thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations in the high
temperature limit for $sl(r+1)$ models.  Based on this observation, we propose
possible functional relations for models associated with all the simple Lie
algebras.  We show that these functional relations certainly fulfill strong
constraints coming from the fusion procedure analysis.  The application to the
calculations of physical quantities will be presented in the subsequent
publication.
