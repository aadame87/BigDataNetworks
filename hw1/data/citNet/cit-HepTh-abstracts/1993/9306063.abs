  In this paper the $c=1$ matrix model deformed by a $1/x^{2}$ piece is
discussed. Tachyon correlation functions are calculated up to genus two using
methods similar to those for the undeformed case. The possible connection with
the two dimensional black hole is also considered. In particular, restrictions
on naked singularities imposed by the matrix model are found.
