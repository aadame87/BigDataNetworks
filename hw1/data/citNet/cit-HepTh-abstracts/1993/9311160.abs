  The oscillations of photon distribution function for squeezed and correlated
light are shown to decrease when the temperature increases.The influence of the
squeezing parameter and photon quadrature correlation coefficient on the photon
distribution oscillations at nonzero temperatures is studied. The connection of
deformation of Planck distribution formula with oscillations of distribution
for squeezed and correlated light is discussed.
