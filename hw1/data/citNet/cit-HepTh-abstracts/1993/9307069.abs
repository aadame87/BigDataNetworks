Title: On the Necessity of Rational Velocities: a Gedankenexperiment
Authors: M.C. Nemes and Saulo C.S. Silva
Comments: 4 pages IFUSP/P-1058
\\
  In the present contribution we propose a gedankenexperiment in which the
restriction of rational values on the velocities emerges as a necessary
condition from Classical Electromagnetism and Quantum Mechanics. This
restriction is shown to be intimately connected to Dirac's electric charge
quantization condition.
