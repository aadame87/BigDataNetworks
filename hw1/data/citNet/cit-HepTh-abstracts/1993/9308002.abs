  The physical phase space of gauge field theories on a cylindrical spacetime
with an arbitrary compact simple gauge group is shown to be the quotient $ {\bf
R}^{2r}/W_A, $ $ r $ a rank of the gauge group, $ W_A $ the affine Weyl group.
The PI formula resulting from Dirac's operator method contains a symmetrization
with respect to $ W_A $ rather than the integration domain reduction. It gives
a natural solution to Gribov's problem. Some features of fermion quantum
dynamics caused by the nontrivial phase space geometry are briefly discussed.
