Title: On the Problems with Background Independence in String Theory
Authors: S. Shatashvili
Comments: 15p., Preprint IASSNS-HEP-93/66
\\
  The problems with background independence are discussed in the example of
open string theory. Based on the recent proposal by Witten I calculate the
String Field Theory action in conformal perturbation theory to second order and
demonstrate that the proper treatment of contact terms leads to nontrivial
equations of motion. I conjecture the form of the field theory action to all
orders.
