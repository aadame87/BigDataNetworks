Title: The Zamolodchikov C-Function, Classical Closed String Field Theory, The
  Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem, The Renormalization Group, and all that

  In this article we formulate a `topological' field theory by employing a
generalization of the Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem to localize the path-integral
of the `topological action' C^2 , where C is a slight modification of the
Zamolodchikov C-Function, over the space of all two-dimensional field theories
to the fixed points of the renormalization group's identity component. Also, we
propose an interpretation of the background independent classical closed string
field theory action S in terms of the Zamolodchikov C-Function's modification.
