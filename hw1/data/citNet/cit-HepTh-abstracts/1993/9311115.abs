  We study the Regge regime of QCD as a special regime of lattice gauge theory
on an asymmetric lattice. This lattice has a spacing $a_0 $ in the longitudinal
direction and a spacing $a_t $ in the transversal direction. The limit
$\frac{a_{0}}{a_{t}} \to 0$ corresponds to correlation functions with small
longitudinal and large transversal coordinates, i.e. large $s$ and small $t$.
On this lattice the longitudinal dynamics is described by the usual
two-dimensional chiral field in finite volume and the transversal dynamics is
emerged through an effective interaction of boundary terms of the longitudinal
dynamics. The effective interaction depends crucially on the spectrum of the
two-dimensional chiral field. Massless exitations produce an effective
2-dimensional action which is different from the action recently proposed by
H.Verlinde and E.Verlinde. Massive exitations give raise to an effective action
located on the contour in the longitudinal plane.
