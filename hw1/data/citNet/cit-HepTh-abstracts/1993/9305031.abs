  We study by non perturbative techniques a vector, axial--vector theory
characterized by a parameter which interpolates between pure vector and chiral
Schwinger models. Main results are two windows in the space of parameters which
exhibit acceptable solutions. In the first window we find a free massive and a
free massless bosonic excitations and interacting left--right fermions endowed
with asymptotic \hbox{states}, which feel however a long range interaction. In
the second window the massless bosonic excitation is a negative norm state
which can be consistently expunged from the ``physical" Hilbert space; fermions
are confined. An intriguing feature of our model occurs in the first window
where we find that fermionic correlators scale at both short and long
distances, but with different critical exponents. The infrared limit in the
fermionic sector is nothing but a dynamically generated massless Thirring
model.
