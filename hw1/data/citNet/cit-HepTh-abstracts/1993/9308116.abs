  We solve Schr\"odinger's equation for the ground-state of {\it
four}-dimensional Yang-Mills theory as an expansion in inverse powers of the
coupling. Expectation values computed with the leading order approximation are
reduced to a calculation in {\it two}-dimensional Yang-Mills theory which is
known to confine. Consequently the Wilson loop in the four-dimensional theory
obeys an area law to leading order and the coupling becomes infinite as the
mass-scale goes to zero.
