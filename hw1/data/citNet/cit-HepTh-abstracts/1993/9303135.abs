  Gravity

  We clarify the relation between 2-form Einstein gravity and its topological
version. The physical space of the topological version is contained in that of
the Einstein gravity.
  Moreover a new vector field is introduced into 2-form Einstein gravity to
restore the large symmetry of its topological version. The wave function of the
universe is obtained for each model. (Talk given at the Workshop on General
Relativity and Gravitation held at Waseda University, January 18-20, 1993.)
