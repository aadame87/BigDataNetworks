  The study of the integrability properties of the N=2 Landau- Ginzburg models
leads naturally to a graph generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation which
synthetizes the well known vertex and RSOS Yang-Baxter equations. A non trivial
solution of this equation is found for the $t_2$ perturbation of the A-models,
which turns out to be intimately related to the Boltzmann weights of a Chiral-
Potts model.
