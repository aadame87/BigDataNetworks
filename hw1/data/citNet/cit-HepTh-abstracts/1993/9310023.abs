  We study the minimal supersymmetric standard model derived from the $Z_8$
orbifold models and its hidden sectors. We use a target-space duality anomaly
cancellation so as to investigate hidden sectors consistent with the MSSM
unification. For the allowed hidden sectors, we estimate the running gauge
coupling constants making use of threshold corrections due to the higher
massive modes. The calculation is important from the viewpoint of gaugino
condensations, which is one of the most promissing mechanism to break the
supersymmetry.
