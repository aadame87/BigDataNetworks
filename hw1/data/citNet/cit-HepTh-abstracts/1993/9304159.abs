  An ADM mass formula is derived for a wide class of black solutions with
certain spherical symmetry. By applying this formula, we calculate the ADM
masses for recently discovered black strings and $p$-branes in diverse
dimensions. By this, the Bogolmol'nyi equation can be shown to hold explicitly.
A useful observation is made for non-extremal black $p$-branes that only for $p
= 0$, i.e. for a black hole, can its ADM mass be read directly from the
asymptotic behaviour of the metric component $g_{00}$.
