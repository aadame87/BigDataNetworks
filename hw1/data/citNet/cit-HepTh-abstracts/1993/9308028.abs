Title: Zeta-Function Regularization is Uniquely Defined and Well
Authors: E. Elizalde
Comments: 7 pages, LaTeX file
Journal-ref: J.Phys. A27 (1994) L299-L304
\\
  Hawking's zeta function regularization procedure is shown to be rigorously
and uniquely defined, thus putting and end to the spreading lore about
different difficulties associated with it. Basic misconceptions,
misunderstandings and errors which keep appearing in important scientific
journals when dealing with this beautiful regularization method ---and other
analytical procedures--- are clarified and corrected.
