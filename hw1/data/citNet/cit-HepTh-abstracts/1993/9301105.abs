  The classical black hole background of two-dimensional string theory is
examined after including the effect of the tachyon field. Keeping all terms
upto $O(T^2)$, and making no other approximations, the only consistent
classical solution to the resulting dilaton-graviton theory is found to be flat
spacetime with a nontrivial dilaton.
