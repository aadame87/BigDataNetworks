  Star products on the classical double group of a simple Lie group and on
corresponding symplectic grupoids are given so that the quantum double and the
"quantized tangent bundle" are obtained in the deformation description.
"Complex" quantum groups and bicovariant quantum Lie algebras are discused from
this point of view. Further we discuss the quantization of the Poisson
structure on symmetric algebra $S(g)$ leading to the quantized enveloping
algebra $U_{h}(g)$ as an example of biquantization in the sense of Turaev.
Description of $U_{h}(g)$ in terms of the generators of the bicovariant
differential calculus on $F(G_q)$ is very convenient for this purpose. Finally
we interpret in the deformation framework some well known properties of compact
quantum groups as simple consequences of corresponding properties of classical
compact Lie groups. An analogue of the classical Kirillov's universal character
formula is given for the unitary irreducible representation in the compact
case.
