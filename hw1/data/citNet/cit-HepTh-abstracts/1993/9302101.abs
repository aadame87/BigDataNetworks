Title: Quantum Gravity and Black Hole

  The quantum theory of the spherically symmetric gravity in 3+1 dimensions is
investigated. The functional measures are explicitly evaluated and the physical
state conditions are derived by using the technique developed in two
dimensional quantum gravity. Then the new features which are not seen in ADM
formalism come out. If $\kappa_s > 0 $, where $\kappa_s =(N-27)/12\pi $ and $N$
is the number of matter fields, a singularity appears, while for $\kappa_s <0$
the singularity disappears. The quantum dynamics of black hole seems to be
changed by the sign of $\kappa_s $.
