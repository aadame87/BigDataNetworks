  We develop techniques to compute the complete the massless spectrum in
heterotic string compactification on N=2 supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg
orbifolds. This includes not just the familiar charged fields, but also the
gauge singlets. The number of gauge singlets can vary in the moduli space of a
given compactification and can differ from what it would be in the large radius
limit of the corresponding Calabi-Yau. Comparison with exactly soluble Gepner
models provides a confirmation of our results at Gepner points. Our methods
carry over straightforwardly to $(0,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg models.
