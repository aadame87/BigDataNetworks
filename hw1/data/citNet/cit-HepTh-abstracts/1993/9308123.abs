Title: Fixed Point Structure for 3 dimensional rigid string
Authors: Weidong Zhao
Comments: 10 pages
\\
  We show that the usual fixed point for 3-d rigid string with topological term
appears to be a trivial one, consisting of two decoupled conformal field
theories. We further argue that by involving an additional term allowed by
symmetries and thus generated by RG, the theory appears to exhibit a new fixed
point with expected symmetriy. The new fixed point is studied in the weak- and
string coupling limit.
