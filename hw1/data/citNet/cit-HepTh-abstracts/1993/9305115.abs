  The exact free energy of SU($N$) Chern-Simons theory at level $k$ is expanded
in powers of $(N+k)^{-2}.$ This expansion keeps rank-level duality manifest,
and simplifies as $k$ becomes large, keeping $N$ fixed (or vice versa)---this
is the weak-coupling (strong-coupling) limit. With the standard normalization,
the free energy on the three-sphere in this limit is shown to be the generating
function of the Euler characteristics of the moduli spaces of surfaces of genus
$g,$ providing a string interpretation for the perturbative expansion. A
similar expansion is found for the three-torus, with differences that shed
light on contributions from different spacetime topologies in string theory.
