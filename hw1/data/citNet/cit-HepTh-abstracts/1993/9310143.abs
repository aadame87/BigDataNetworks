  Non-perturbative interactions in the effective action of two-dimensional
bosonic string theory are described. These interactions are due to ``stringy"
instantons that are associated with a space-varying coupling parameter. We
present progress towards identifying similar non-perturbative interactions in
the effective action of two-dimensional superstring theory. We discuss the
possible relation to higher dimensional string theory.
