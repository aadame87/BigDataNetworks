  We show that the harmonic Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin method of quantizing
bosonic systems with second-class constraints or first-class holomorphic
constraints extends to systems having both bosonic and fermionic second-class
or first-class holomorphic constraints. Using a limit argument, we show that
the harmonic BRST modified path integral reproduces the correct Senjanovic
measure.
