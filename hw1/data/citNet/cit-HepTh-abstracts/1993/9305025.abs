  We study the cosmological solutions of the one loop corrected superstring
effective action, in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background, and in the
presence of the dilaton and modulus fields. A particularly interesting class of
solutions is found which avoid the initial singularity and are consistent with
the perturbative treatment of the effective action.
