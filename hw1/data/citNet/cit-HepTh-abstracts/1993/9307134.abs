Title: Optimal Photon Localization
Authors: J. Mourad
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  We show that there is only one operator having some minimal properties
enabling it to be a one photon position operator. These proerties are stated,
and the solution is shown to be the photon position operator proposed by Pryce.
This operator has non-commuting components. Nevertheless, it is shown that one
can find states localized with an arbitrary precision.
