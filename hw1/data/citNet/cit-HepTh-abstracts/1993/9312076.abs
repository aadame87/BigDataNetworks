\\
  A Cartan Calculus of Lie derivatives, differential forms, and inner
derivations, based on an undeformed Cartan identity, is constructed. We attempt
a classification of various types of quantum Lie algebras and present a fairly
general example for their construction, utilizing pure braid methods, proving
orthogonality of the adjoint representation and giving a (Killing) metric and
the quadratic casimir. A reformulation of the Cartan calculus as a braided
algebra and its extension to quantum planes, directly and induced from the
group calculus, are provided.
