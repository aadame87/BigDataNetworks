  We present a Lagrangian description of the $SU(2)/U(1)$ coset model perturbed
by its first thermal operator. This is the simplest perturbation that changes
sign under Krammers--Wannier duality. The resulting theory, which is a
2--component generalization of the sine--Gordon model, is then taken in
Minkowski space. For negative values of the coupling constant $g$, it is
classically equivalent to the $O(4)$ non--linear $\s$--model reduced in a
certain frame. For $g > 0$, it describes the relativistic motion of vortices in
a constant external field. Viewing the classical equations of motion as a zero
curvature condition, we obtain recursive relations for the infinitely many
conservation laws by the abelianization method of gauge connections. The higher
spin currents are constructed entirely using an off--critical generalization of
the $W_{\infty}$ generators. We give a geometric interpretation to the
corresponding charges in terms of embeddings. Applications to the chirally
invariant $U(2)$ Gross--Neveu model are also discussed.
