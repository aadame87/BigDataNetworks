Title: Antibrackets and Supersymmetric Mechanics

\\
  Using odd symplectic structure constructed over tangent bundle of the
symplectic manifold, we construct the simple supergeneralization of an
arbitrary Hamiltonian mechanics on it. In the case, if the initial mechanics
defines Killing vector of some Riemannian metric, corresponding supersymmetric
mechanics can be reformulated in the terms of even symplectic structure on the
supermanifold.
