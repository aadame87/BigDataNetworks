  The partition function and the order parameter for the chiral symmetry
breaking are computed for a family of 2-dimensional interacting theories
containing the gauged Thirring model. In particular we derive non-perturbative
expressions for the dependence of the chiral condensate on the temperature and
the curvature. Both, high temperature and high curvature supress the condensate
exponentially and we can associate an effective temperature to the curvature.
