  We investigate the connection between curved spacetime and the emergence of
string-instabilities, following the approach developed by Loust\'{o} and
S\'{a}nchez for de Sitter and black hole spacetimes. We analyse the linearised
equations determining the comoving physical (transverse) perturbations on
circular strings embedded in Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and de
Sitter backgrounds. In all 3 cases we find that the "radial" perturbations grow
infinitely for $r\rightarrow 0$ (ring-collapse), while the "angular"
perturbations are bounded in this limit. For $r\rightarrow\infty$ we find that
the perturbations in both physical directions (perpendicular to the string
world-sheet in 4 dimensions) blow up in the case of de Sitter space. This
confirms results recently obtained by Loust\'{o} and S\'{a}nchez who considered
perturbations around the string center of mass.
