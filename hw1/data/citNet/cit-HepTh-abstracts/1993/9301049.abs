  As shown by Witten the N=1 supersymmetric gauged WZW model based on a group G
has an extended N=2 supersymmetry if the gauged subgroup H is so chosen that
G/H is Kahler. We extend Witten's result and prove that the N=1 supersymmetric
gauged WZW models over G X U(1) are actually invariant under N=4 superconformal
transformations if the gauged subgroup H is such that G/HXSU(2) is a
quaternionic symmetric space. A previous construction of "maximal" N=4
superconformal algebras with SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) symmetry is reformulated and
further developed so as to relate them to the N=4 gauged WZW models. Based on
earlier results we expect the quantization of N=4 gauged WZW models to yield
the unitary realizations of maximal N=4 superconformal algebras provided by
this construction.
