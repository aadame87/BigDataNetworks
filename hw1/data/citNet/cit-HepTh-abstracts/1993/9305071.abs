  We prove that the deformed oscillator superalgebra $W_q(n)$ (which in the
Fock representation is generated essentially by $n$ pairs of $q$-bosons) is a
factor algebra of the quantized universal enveloping algebra $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$.
We write down a $q$-analog of the Cartan-Weyl basis for the deformed
$osp(1/2n)$ and give also an oscillator realization of all Cartan-Weyl
generators.
