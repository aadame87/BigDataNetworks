  For a dissipative system with Ohmic friction, we obtain a simple and exact
solution for the wave function of the system plus the bath. It is described by
the direct product in two independent Hilbert space. One of them is described
by an effective Hamiltonian, the other represents the effect of the bath, i.e.,
the Brownian motion, thus clarifying the structure of the wave function of the
system whose energy is dissipated by its interaction with the bath. No path
integral technology is needed in this treatment. The derivation of the
Weisskopf-Wigner line width theory follows easily.
