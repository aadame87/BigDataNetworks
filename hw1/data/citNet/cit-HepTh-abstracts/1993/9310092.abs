  The usual extensions of supersymmetry require the existence of a complex
structure and the formulation of the theory on K\"{a}hler manifolds. It is
shown, that by relaxing the constraints on the algebra of supercharges we can
get new supersymmetries whenever a manifold possesses a structure admitting the
existence of a Killing-Yano tensor field. Examples of such manifolds are the
Kerr-Newman space-times describing spinning black holes in four dimensions.
