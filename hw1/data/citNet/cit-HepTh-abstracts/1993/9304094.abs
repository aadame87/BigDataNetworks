  Following the general method discussed in Refs.[1,2], Liouville gravity and
the 2 dimensional model of non-Einstenian gravity ${\cal L} \sim curv^2 +
torsion^2 + cosm. const.$ can be formulated as ISO(1,1) gauge theories. In the
first order formalism the models present, besides the Poincar\'e gauge
symmetry, additional local symmetries. We show that in both models one can fix
these additional symmetries preserving the ISO(1,1) gauge symmetry and the
diffeomorphism invariance, so that, after a preliminary Dirac procedure, the
remaining constraints uniquely satisfy the ISO(1,1) algebra. After the
additional symmetry is fixed, the equations of motion are unaltered. One thus
remarkably simplifies the canonical structure, especially of the second model.
Moreover, one shows that the Poincar\'e group can always be used consistently
as a gauge group for gravitational theories in two dimensions.
