Title: Instantons, Monopoles, Strings and Fivebranes

  We discuss three classes of solitonic solutions in string theory: instantons,
monopoles and string-like solitons. Instantons may provide a nonperturbative
understanding of the vacuum structure of string theory, while monopoles may
appear in string predictions for grand unification. The particular monopole
solution shown has finite action as the result of the cancellation of gauge and
gravitational singularities, a feature, which if it survives quantization, may
yield insight into the structure of string theory as a finite theory of quantum
gravity. In $D=10$, both monopoles and instantons possess fivebrane structure.
The string-like solitons represent extended states of fundamental strings.(
