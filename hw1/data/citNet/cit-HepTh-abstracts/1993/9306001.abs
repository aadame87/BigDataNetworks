  Integral and differential mass formulae of 4-dimensional stationary and
axisymmetric Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton systems are derived. The total mass
(energy) of these systems are expressed in terms of other physical quantities
such as electric charge of the black hole suitably modified due to the
existence of the dilaton field. It is shown that when we vary slightly the
fields (metric of the spacetime $g_{\mu\nu}$, $U(1)-$gauge potential $A_{\mu}$,
and dilaton $\phi$) in such a way as they obey classical equations of motion,
the variation of the dilaton does not contribute explicitly to the variation of
the total mass, but contributes only through the variation of the electric
charge of the black hole.
