  We show that the WZNW model with arbitrary $\sigma$-model coupling constant
may be viewed as a $\sigma$-model perturbation of the WZNW theory around the
Witten conformal point. In order for the $\sigma$-model perturbation to be
relevant, the level $k$ of the underlying affine algebra has to be negative. We
prove that in the large $|k|$ limit the perturbed WZNW system with negative $k$
flows to the conformal WZNW model with positive level. The flow appears to be
integrable due to the existence of conserved currents satisfying the Lax
equation. This fact is in a favorable agreement with the integrability of the
WZNW model discovered by Polyakov and Wiegmann within the Bethe ansatz
technique.
