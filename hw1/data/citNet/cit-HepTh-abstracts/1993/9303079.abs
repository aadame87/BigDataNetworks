Title: Matrix Models of Induced Large-N QCD
Authors: Yu. Makeenko
Comments: LaTex (5 LaTex figures), 17 pages, ITEP-YM-11-92. Talk at the Seminar
  on Strings, Matrix Models and all that
\\
  I review recent works on the problem of inducing large-N QCD by matrix
fields. In the first part of the talk I describe the matrix models which induce
large-N QCD and present the results of studies of their phase structure by the
standard lattice technology (in particular, by the mean field method). The
second part is devoted to the exact solution of these models in the strong
coupling region by means of the loop equations.
