  Exact wavefunctions for N non-Abelian Chern-Simons (NACS) particles are
obtained by the ladder operator approach. The same method has previously been
applied to construct exact wavefunctions for multi-anyon systems. The two
distinct base states of the NACS particles that we use are multi-valued and are
defined in terms of path ordered line integrals. Only strings of operators that
preserve the monodromy properties of these base states are allowed to act on
them to generate new states.
