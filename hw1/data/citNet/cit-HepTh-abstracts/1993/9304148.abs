  Black hole formation/evaporation in two-dimensional dilaton gravity can be
described, in the limit where the number $N$ of matter fields becomes large, by
a set of second-order partial differential equations. In this paper we solve
these equations numerically. It is shown that, contrary to some previous
suggestions, black holes evaporate completely a finite time after formation. A
boundary condition is required to evolve the system beyond the naked
singularity at the evaporation endpoint. It is argued that this may be
naturally chosen so as to restore the system to the vacuum. The analysis also
applies to the low-energy scattering of $S$-wave fermions by four-dimensional
extremal, magnetic, dilatonic black holes.
