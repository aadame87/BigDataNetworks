  Previous studies of high-energy scattering in QCD have shown a remarkable
correspondence with two-dimensional field theory. In this paper we formulate a
simple effective model in which this two-dimensional nature of the interactions
is manifest. Starting from the (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills action, we
implement the high energy limit $s\! >\! > \! t$ via a scaling argument and we
derive from this a simplified effective theory. This effective theory is still
(3+1)-dimensional, but we show that its interactions can to leading order be
summarized in terms of a two-dimensional sigma-model defined on the transverse
plane. Finally, we verify that our formulation is consistent with known
perturbative results. This is a revised and extended version of hep-th 9302104.
In particular, we have added a section that clarifies the connection with
Lipatov's gluon emission vertex.
