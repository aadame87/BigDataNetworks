  A Fermion in 2+1 dimensions, with a mass function which depends on one
spatial coordinate and passes through a zero ( a domain wall mass), is
considered. In this model, originally proposed by Callan and Harvey, the gauge
variation of the effective gauge action mainly consists of two terms. One comes
from the induced Chern-Simons term and the other from the chiral fermions,
bound to the 1+1 dimensional wall, and they are expected to cancel each other.
Though there exist arguments in favour of this, based on the possible forms of
the effective action valid far from the wall and some facts about theories of
chiral fermions in 1+1 dimensions, a complete calculation is lacking. In this
paper we present an explicit calculation of this cancellation at one loop valid
even close to the wall. We show that, integrating out the ``massive'' modes of
the theory does produce the Chern-Simons term, as appreciated previously. In
addition we show that it generates a term that softens the high energy
behaviour of the 1+1 dimensional effective chiral theory thereby resolving an
ambiguity present in a general 1+1 dimensional theory.
