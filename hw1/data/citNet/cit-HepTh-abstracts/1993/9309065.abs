  Yang-Mills theories on a 1+1 dimensional cylinder are considered. It is shown
that canonical quantization can proceed following different routes, leading to
inequivalent quantizations. The problem of the non-free action of the gauge
group on the configuration space is also discussed. In particular we re-examine
the relationship between ``$\theta$-states" and the fundamental group of the
configuration space. It is shown that this relationship does or does not hold
depending on whether or not the gauge transformations not connected to the
identity act freely on the space of connections modulo connected gauge
transformations.
