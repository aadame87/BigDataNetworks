  We explicitly show that the Landau gauge supersymmetry of Chern-Simons theory
does not have any physical significance. In fact, the difference between an
effective action both BRS invariant and Landau supersymmetric and an effective
action only BRS invariant is a finite field redefinition. Having established
this, we use a BRS invariant regulator that defines CS theory as the large mass
limit of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory to discuss the shift $k \to
k+\cv$ of the bare Chern-Simons parameter $k$ in conncection with the Landau
supersymmetry. Finally, to convince ourselves that the shift above is not an
accident of our regularization method, we comment on the fact that all BRS
invariant regulators used as yet yield the same value for the shift.
