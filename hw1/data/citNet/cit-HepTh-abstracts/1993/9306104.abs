Title: Space-Time Transitions in String Theory
Authors: Edward Witten
Comments: 6 pages, Phyzzx
Report-no: IASSNS-HEP-93/36
\\
  Simple mean field methods can be used to describe transitions between
different space-time models in string theory. These include transitions between
different Calabi-Yau manifolds, and more exotic things such as the
Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzberg correspondence.
