Title: Classical Stringy Black Holes Modify the Thermal Spectrum
Authors: B. Harms and Y. Leblanc
Comments: 8 pages, REVTEX
\\
  Non-local (alpha prime) corrections to Schwarzschild black holes are shown to
invalidate the thermodynamical interpretation of black holes. In particular,
the canonical and Bekenstein-Hawking temperatures are not equal. The particle
number density of fields quantized in the (alpha prime modified) black hole
background is no longer thermal. In the non-perturbative region (alpha prime
going to infinity or mass going to zero), an analytic continuation to the
number density is shown to vanish exponentially.
