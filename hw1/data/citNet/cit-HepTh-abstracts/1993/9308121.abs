Title: Extending the Theory of Random Surfaces
Authors: Christof Schmidhuber, Caltech Ph.D. thesis
Comments: 75 pages, Tex
\\
  The theory of embedded random surfaces, equivalent to two--dimensional
quantum gravity coupled to matter, is reviewed, further developed and partly
generalized to four dimensions. It is shown that the action of the Liouville
field theory that describes random surfaces contains terms that have not been
noticed previously. These terms are used to explain the phase diagram of the
Sine--Gordon model coupled to gravity, in agreement with recent results from
lattice computations. It is also demonstrated how the methods of
two--dimensional quantum gravity can be applied to four--dimensional Euclidean
gravity in the limit of infinite Weyl coupling. Critical exponents are
predicted and an analog of the ``$c=1$ barrier'' of two--dimensional gravity is
derived.
