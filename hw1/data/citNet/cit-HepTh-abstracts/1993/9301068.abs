  The partition function of two dimensional QCD on a Riemann surface of area
$A$ is expanded as a power series in $1/N$ and $A$. It is shown that the
coefficients of this expansion are precisely determined by a sum over maps from
a two dimensional surface onto the two dimensional target space. Thus two
dimensional QCD has a simple interpretation as a closed string theory.
