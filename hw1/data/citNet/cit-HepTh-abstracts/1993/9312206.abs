  A long-standing conjecture on the structure of renormalized, gauge invariant,
integrated operators of arbitrary dimension in Yang-Mills theory is
established. The general solution of the consistency condition for anomalies
with sources included is also derived. This is achieved by computing
explicitely the cohomology of the full unrestricted BRST operator in the space
of local polynomial functionals with ghost number equal to zero or one. The
argument does not use power counting and is purely cohomological. It relies
crucially on standard properties of the antifield formalism.
