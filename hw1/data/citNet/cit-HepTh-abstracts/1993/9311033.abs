  We extend previous work on the IR regime approximation of QCD in which the
dominant contribution comes from a dressed two-gluon effective metric-like
field $G_{\mu\nu} = g_{ab} B^{a}_{\mu} B^{b}_{\nu}$ ($g_{ab}$ a color $SU(3)$
metric). The ensuring effective theory is represented by a
pseudo-diffeomorphisms gauge theory. The second -quantized $G_{\mu\nu}$ field,
together with the Lorentz generators close on the $\overline{SL}(4,R)$ algebra.
This algebra represents a spectrum generating algebra for the set of hadron
states of a given flavor - hadronic "manifields" transforming w.r.t.
$\overline{SL}(4,R)$ (infinite-dimensional) unitary irreducible
representations. The equations of motion for the effective pseudo-gravity are
derived from a quadratic action describing Riemannian pseudo-gravity in the
presence of shear ($\overline{SL}(4,R)$ covariant) hadronic matter currents.
These equations yield $p^{-4}$ propagators, i.e. a linearly rising confining
potential $H(r) \sim r$, as well as linear $J \sim m^{2}$ Regge trajectories.
The $\overline{SL}(4,R)$ symmetry based dynamical theory for the QCD IR region
is applied to hadron resonances. All presently known meson and baryon
resonances are successfully accommodated and various missing states predicted.
