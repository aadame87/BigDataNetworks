  We investigate the relationship between the generalized uncertainty principle
in quantum gravity and the quantum deformation of the Poincar\'e algebra. We
find that a deformed Newton-Wigner position operator and the generators of
spatial translations and rotations of the deformed Poincar\'e algebra obey a
deformed Heisenberg algebra from which the generalized uncertainty principle
follows. The result indicates that in the $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebra
a minimal observable length emerges naturally.
