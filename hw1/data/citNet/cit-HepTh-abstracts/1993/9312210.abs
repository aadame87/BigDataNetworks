  The Kazakov-Migdal model, if considered as a functional of external fields,
can be always represented as an expansion over characters of $GL$ group. The
integration over "matter fields" can be interpreted as going over the {\it
model} (the space of all highest weight representations) of $GL$. In the case
of compact unitary groups the integrals should be substituted by {\it discrete}
sums over weight lattice. The $D=0$ version of the model is the Generalized
Kontsevich integral, which in the above-mentioned unitary (discrete) situation
coincides with partition function of the $2d$ Yang-Mills theory with the target
space of genus $g=0$ and $m=0,1,2$ holes. This particular quantity is always a
bilinear combination of characters and appears to be a Toda-lattice
$\tau$-function. (This is generalization of the classical statement that
individual $GL$ characters are always singular KP $\tau$-functions.) The
corresponding element of the Universal Grassmannian is very simple and somewhat
similar to the one, arising in investigations of the $c=1$ string models.
However, under certain circumstances the formal sum over representations should
be evaluated by steepest descent method and this procedure leads to some more
complicated elements of Grassmannian. This "Kontsevich phase" as opposed to the
simple "character phase" deserves further investigation.
