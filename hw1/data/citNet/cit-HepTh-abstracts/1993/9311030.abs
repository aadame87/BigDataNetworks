Title: Green Functions and Thermal Nature of Black Holes
Authors: Milan Mijic
Comments: 14 pages, Plain Tex
\\
  There are several ways to establish and study thermal properties of black
holes. I review here method of Fulling and Ruijsenaars, based on the analytic
structure of Green functions on the complex plane. This method provides a clear
distinction between zero and finite temperature field theories, and allows for
quick evaluation of black hole temperature. (Lectures presented at the Danube
Workshop '93, June 1993, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.)
