Title: Aspects of $\kappa$--symmetry
Authors: E. Sezgin
Comments: 21 pages, plain tex, CTP TAMU-28/93. (Based on a talk given at the
  Salamfest, Trieste, March 1993)

  We review various aspects of a fermionic gauge symmetry, known as the
$\kappa$--symmetry, which plays an important role in formulations of
superstrings, supermembranes and higher dimensional extended objects. We also
review some aspects of the connection between $\kappa$--symmetric theories and
their twistor-like formulations.
