Title: Continued Fraction as a Discrete Nonlinear Transform
Authors: Carl M. Bender and Kimball A. Milton
Comments: 6 pages, OKHEP-93-05
\\
  The connection between a Taylor series and a continued-fraction involves a
nonlinear relation between the Taylor coefficients $\{ a_n \}$ and the
continued-fraction coefficients $\{ b_n \}$. In many instances it turns out
that this nonlinear relation transforms a complicated sequence $\{a_n \}$ into
a very simple one $\{ b_n \}$. We illustrate this simplification in the context
of graph combinatorics.
