Title: String Theory on Calabi--Yau Manifolds: The Three Generations Case
Authors: Doron Gepner
Comments: Priceton preprint, December 1987. Note: this paper appeared only as a
  preprint on December 1987. Recently, a number of physicists have suggested
  its republication due to the fact that old preprints are not easily
  accesible. This is the original tex file used at that time
\\
  Recently, string theory on Calabi--Yau manifolds was constructed and was
shown to be a fully consistent, space--time supersymmetric string theory. The
physically interesting case is the case of three generations. Intriguingly, it
appears at the present that there is a unique manifold which gives rise to
three generations. We describe in this paper a full fledged string theory on
this manifold in which the complete spectrum and all the Yukawa couplings can
be computed exactly.
