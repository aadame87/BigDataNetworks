  Self-consistent Hamiltonian formulation of scalar theory on the null plane is
constructed following Dirac method. The theory contains also {\it constraint
equations}. They would give, if solved, to a nonlinear and nonlocal
Hamiltonian. The constraints lead us in the continuum to a different
description of spontaneous symmetry breaking since, the symmetry generators now
annihilate the vacuum. In two examples where the procedure lacks
self-consistency, the corresponding theories are known ill-defined from
equal-time quantization. This lends support to the method adopted where both
the background field and the fluctuation above it are treated as dynamical
variables on the null plane. We let the self-consistency of the Dirac procedure
determine their properties in the quantized theory. The results following from
the continuum and the discretized formulations in the infinite volume limit do
agree.
