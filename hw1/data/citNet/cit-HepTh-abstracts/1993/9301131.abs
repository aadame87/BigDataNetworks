  We display a new integrable perturbation for both N=1 and N=2 superconformal
minimal models. These perturbations break supersymmetry explicitly. Their
existence was expected on the basis of the classification of integrable
perturbations of conformal field theories in terms of distinct classical KdV
type hierarchies sharing a common second Hamiltonian structure.
