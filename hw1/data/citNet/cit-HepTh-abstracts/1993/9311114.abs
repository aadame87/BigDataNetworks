  The concept of universal T matrix, recently introduced by Fronsdal and
Galindo in the framework of quantum groups, is here discussed as a
generalization of the exponential mapping. New examples related to
inhomogeneous quantum groups of physical interest are developed, the duality
calculations are explicitly presented and it is found that in some cases the
universal T matrix, like for Lie groups, is expressed in terms of usual
exponential series.
