  A class of Poisson embeddings of reduced, finite dimensional symplectic
vector spaces into the dual space $\Lg_R^*$ of a loop algebra, with Lie Poisson
structure determined by the classical split $R$--matrix $R=P_+ - P_-$ is
introduced. These may be viewed as equivariant moment maps inducing natural
Hamiltonian actions of the ``dual'' group $\LG_R = \LGp \times \LGm$ of a loop
group $\LG$ on the symplectic space. The $R$--matrix version of the
Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem is used to induce commuting flows determined by
isospectral equations of Lax type. The compatibility conditions determine
finite dimensional classes of solutions to integrable systems of PDE's, which
can be integrated using the standard Liouville-Arnold approach. This involves
an appropriately chosen ``spectral Darboux'' (canonical) coordinate system in
which there is a complete separation of variables. As an example, the method is
applied to the determination of finite dimensional quasi-periodic solutions of
the sine-Gordon equation.
