Title: Supersymmetry and Black Holes
Authors: Renata Kallosh
Comments: 8 p., invited talk at SUSY 93, LaTeX (misprints in eqs. (11)-(13) are

  We consider static black holes, which are bosonic solutions of supersymmetric
theories. We will show that supersymmetry provides a natural framework for a
discussion of various properties of such static black holes. The most
fundamental property of simple global supersymmetry, non-negativeness of the
energy, is generalized in the black hole theory to cosmic censorship. The SUSY
classification of static black holes will be presented in terms of central
charges of supersymmetry algebra. The mass, the temperature and the entropy of
these black holes are simple functions of supersymmetry charges. The extreme
black holes have zero temperature and some unbroken supersymmetries.
