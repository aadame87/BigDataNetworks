Title: Matrix Models of 2D Gravity and Induced QCD
Authors: Yu. Makeenko
Comments: 14pp., Latex, ITEP-YM-6-93 (a review talk)

  I review some recent works on the Hermitean one-matrix and d-dimensional
gauge-invariant matrix models. Special attention is paid to solving the models
at large-N by the loop equations. For the one-matrix model the main result
concerns calculations of higher genera, while for the d-dimensional model the
large-N solution for a logarithmic potential is described. Some results on
fermionic matrix models are briefly reviewed. Talk at the Workshop on Quantum
