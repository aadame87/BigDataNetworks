  The dissipative Hofstadter model, which describes a particle in 2-D subject
to a periodic potential, uniform magnetic field, and dissipation, is also
related to open string boundary states. This model exhibits an SL(2,Z) duality
symmetry and hidden reparametrization invariance symmetries. These symmetries
are useful for finding exact solutions for correlation functions.
