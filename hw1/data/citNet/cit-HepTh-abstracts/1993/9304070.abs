  A discretized time evolution of the wave function for a Dirac particle on a
cubic lattice is represented by a very simple quantum cellular automaton. In
each evolution step the updated value of the wave function at a given site
depends only on the values at the nearest sites, the evolution is unitary and
preserves chiral symmetry. Moreover, it is shown that the relationship between
Dirac particles and cellular automata operating on two component objects on a
lattice is indeed very close. Every local and unitary automaton on a cubic
lattice, under some natural assumptions, leads in the continuum limit to the
Weyl equation. The sum over histories is evaluated and its connection with path
integrals and theories of fermions on a lattice is outlined.
