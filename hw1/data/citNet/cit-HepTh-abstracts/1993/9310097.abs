  Based on the representation theory of the $q$-deformed Lorentz and Poincar\'e
symmeties $q$-deformed relativistic wave equation are constructed. The most
important cases of the Dirac-, Proca-, Rarita-Schwinger- and Maxwell- equations
are treated explicitly. The $q$-deformed wave operators look structurally like
the undeformed ones but they consist of the generators of a non-commu\-ta\-tive
Minkowski space. The existence of the $q$-deformed wave equations together with
previous existence of the $q$-deformed wave equations together with previous
results on the representation theory of the $q$-deformed Poincar\'e symmetry
solve the $q$-deformed relativistic one particle problem.
