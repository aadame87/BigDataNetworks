  We present a solution of the problem of a free massless scalar field on the
half line interacting through a periodic potential on the boundary. For a
critical value of the period, this system is a conformal field theory with a
non-trivial and explicitly calculable S-matrix for scattering from the
boundary. Unlike all other exactly solvable conformal field theories, it is
non-rational ({\it i.e.} has infinitely many primary fields). It describes the
critical behavior of a number of condensed matter systems, including
dissipative quantum mechanics and of barriers in ``quantum wires''.
