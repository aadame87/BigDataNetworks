  We have investigated the standard one-loop quantum corrections for a
particularly simple non-commutative geometry model containing fermions
interacting with a unique abelian gauge field and a unique scalar through
Yukawa couplings. In this model there are certain relations among the different
coupling constants quite similar to the ones appearing in the Connes-Lott
version of the standard model. We find that it is not possible to implement
those relations in a renormalization-group invariant way.
