  We study the algebra $B_q(\ge)$ presented by Kashiwara and introduce
intertwiners similar to $q$-vertex operators. We show that a matrix determined
by 2-point functions of the intertwiners coincides with a quantum R-matrix (up
to a diagonal matrix) and give the commutation relations of the intertwiners.
We also introduce an analogue of the universal R-matrix for the Kashiwara
algebra.
