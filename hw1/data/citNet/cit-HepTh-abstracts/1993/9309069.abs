  We study the construction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model from
the $Z_8$ orbifold models. We use a target-space duality anomaly cancellation
and a unification of gauge couplings as constraints. It is shown that some
models obtained through a systematical search realize the unification of SU(3)
and SU(2) coupling constants.
