Title: Dyonic black holes in effective string theories

  The spherical symmetric dyonic black hole solutions of the effective action
of heterotic string are studied perturbatively up to second order in the
inverse string tension. An expression for the temperature in term of the mass
and the electric and magnetic charge of the black hole is derived and it is
shown that its behaviour is qualitatively different in the two special cases
where either the electric or the magnetic charge vanishes
