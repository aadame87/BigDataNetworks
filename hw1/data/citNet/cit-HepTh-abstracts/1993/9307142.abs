  For the case of a first-class constrained system with an equivariant momentum
map, we study the conditions under which the double process of reducing to the
constraint surface and dividing out by the group of gauge transformations $G$
is equivalent to the single process of dividing out the initial phase space by
the complexification $G_C$ of $G$. For the particular case of a phase space
action that is the lift of a configuration space action, conditions are found
under which, in finite dimensions, the physical phase space of a gauge system
with first-class constraints is diffeomorphic to a manifold imbedded in the
physical configuration space of the complexified gauge system. Similar
conditions are shown to hold in the infinite-dimensional example of Yang-Mills
theories. As a physical application we discuss the adequateness of using
holomorphic Wilson loop variables as (generalized) global coordinates on the
physical phase space of Yang-Mills theory.
