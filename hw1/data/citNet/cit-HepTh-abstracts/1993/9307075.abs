  A $q$-discretization of \vi\ algebra is studied which reduces to the ordinary
\vi\ algebra in the limit of $q \ra 1$. This is derived starting from the Moyal
bracket algebra, hence is a kind of quantum deformation different from the
quantum groups. Representation of this new algebra by using $q$-parametrized
free fields is also given.
