  The quantum action principle of renormalisation theory is applied to the
antibracket-antifield formalism for Hamiltonian systems. General results on the
local BRST cohomology allow one to prove that the anomalies appear in the time
development of the BRST charge and violate the nilpotency of this charge.
Furthermore they are equivalent to those of the Lagrangian formalism. The
analysis provides a completely gauge and regularisation independent proof of
Faddeev's conjecture on the relationship between gauge anomalies and Schwinger
terms in the context of descent equations.
