  Coherent states path integral formalism for the simplest quantum algebras,
q-oscillator, SU_q(2) and SU_q(1,1) is introduced. In the classical limit
canonical structure is derived with modified symplectic and Riemannian metric.
Non-constant deformation induced curvature for the phase spaces is obtained.
