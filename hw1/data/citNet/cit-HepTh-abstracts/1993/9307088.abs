  We give a complete proof of local background independence of the classical
master action for closed strings by constructing explicitly, for any two nearby
conformal theories in a CFT theory space, a symplectic diffeomorphism between
their state spaces mapping the corresponding non-polynomial string actions into
each other. We uncover a new family of string vertices, the lowest of which is
a three string vertex satisfying exact Jacobi identities with respect to the
original closed string vertices. The homotopies between the two sets of string
vertices determine the diffeomorphism establishing background independence. The
linear part of the diffeomorphism is implemented by a CFT theory-space
connection determined by the off-shell three closed string vertex, showing how
string field theory induces a natural interplay between Riemann surface
geometry and CFT theory space geometry. (Three figures are contained in a
separate tar compressed uuencoded figures file. See the TeX file for
instructions for printing the figures.)
