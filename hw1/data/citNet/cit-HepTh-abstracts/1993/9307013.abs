  Using (1,0) superfield methods, we determine the general scalar potential
consistent with off-shell (p,0) supersymmetry and (1,1) supersymmetry in
two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with torsion. We also present an
extended superfield formulation of the (p,0) models and show how the (1,1)
models can be obtained from the (1,1)-superspace formulation of the gauged, but
massless, (1,1) sigma model.
