  We formulate a general set of consistency requirements, which are expected to
be satisfied by the scattering matrices in the presence of reflecting
boundaries. In particular we derive an equivalent to the boostrap equation
involving the W-matrix, which encodes the reflection of a particle off a wall.
This set of equations is sufficient to derive explicit formulas for $W$, which
we illustrate in the case of some particular affine Toda field theories.
