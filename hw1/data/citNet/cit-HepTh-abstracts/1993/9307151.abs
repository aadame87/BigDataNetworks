  We present an efficient method for computing the duality group $\Gamma$ of
the moduli space \cM for strings compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold
described by a two-moduli deformation of the quintic polynomial immersed in
$\CP(4)$, $\cW={1\over5}(\iy_1^5+\cdots+\iy_5^5)-a\,\iy_4^3 \iy_5^2 -b\,
\iy_4^2 \iy_5^3$. We show that $\Gamma$ is given by a $3$--dimensional
representation of a central extension of $B_5$, the braid group on five
strands.
