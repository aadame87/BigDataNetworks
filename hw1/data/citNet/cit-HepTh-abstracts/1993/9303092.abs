   Remarkable parallelism between the theory of
integrable systems of first-order quasilinear PDE and some old results in
projective and affine differential geometry of conjugate nets, Laplace
equations, their Bianchi-Baecklund transformations is exposed.
   These results were recently applied by I.M.Krichever and
B.A.Dubrovin to prove integrability of some models in
topological field theories. Within the geometric framework we
derive some new integrable (in a sense to be discussed)
generalizations describing N-wave resonant interactions.
