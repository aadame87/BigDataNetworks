  We show how any integrable 2D QFT enjoys the existence of infinitely many
non--abelian {\it conserved} charges satisfying a Yang--Baxter symmetry
algebra. These charges are generated by quantum monodromy operators and provide
a representation of $q-$deformed affine Lie algebras. We review and generalize
the work of de Vega, Eichenherr and Maillet on the bootstrap construction of
the quantum monodromy operators to the sine--Gordon (or massive Thirring)
model, where such operators do not possess a classical analogue. Within the
light--cone approach to the mT model, we explicitly compute the eigenvalues of
the six--vertex alternating transfer matrix $\tau(\l)$ on a generic physical
state, through algebraic Bethe ansatz. In the thermodynamic limit $\tau(\l)$
turns out to be a two--valued periodic function. One determination generates
the local abelian charges, including energy and momentum, while the other
yields the abelian subalgebra of the (non--local) YB algebra. In particular,
the bootstrap results coincide with the ratio between the two determinations of
the lattice transfer matrix.
