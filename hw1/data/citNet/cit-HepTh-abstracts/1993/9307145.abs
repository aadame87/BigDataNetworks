  We complete the classification of (2,2) string vacua that can be constructed
by diagonal twists of tensor products of minimal models with ADE invariants.
Using the \LG\ framework, we compute all spectra from inequivalent models of
this type. The completeness of our results is only possible by systematically
avoiding the huge redundancies coming from permutation symmetries of tensor
products. We recover the results for (2,2) vacua of an extensive computation of
simple current invariants by Schellekens and Yankielowitz, and find 4
additional mirror pairs of spectra that were missed by their stochastic method.
For the model $(1)^9$ we observe a relation between redundant spectra and
groups that are related in a particular way.
