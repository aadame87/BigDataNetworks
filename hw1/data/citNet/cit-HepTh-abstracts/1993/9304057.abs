  The antibracket in BRST theory is known to define a map $\rm{H^p \times H^q
\longrightarrow H^{p+q+1}}$ associating with two equivalence classes of BRST
invariant observables of respective ghost number p and q an equivalence class
of BRST invariant observables of ghost number p+q+1. It is shown that this map
is trivial in the space of all functionals, i.e., that its image contains only
the zeroth class. However it is generically non trivial in the space of local
functionals. Implications of this result for the problem of consistent
interactions among fields with a gauge freedom are then drawn. It is shown that
the obstructions to constructing such interactions lie precisely in the image
of the antibracket map and are accordingly inexistent if one does not insist on
locality. However consistent local interactions are severely constrained. The
example of the Chern-Simons theory is considered. It is proved that the only
consistent, local, Lorentz covariant interactions for the abelian models are
exhausted by the non-abelian Chern-Simons extensions.
