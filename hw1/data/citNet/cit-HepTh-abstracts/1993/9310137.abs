  We study percolation on the worldsheets of string theory for $c=0,1/2,1$ and
$2$. For $c<1$ we find that critical exponents measured from simulations agree
quite well with the theoretical values. For $c=1$ we show how log corrections
determined from the exact solution reconcile numerical results with the KPZ
predictions. We extend this analysis to the large $c$ regime and estimate how
finite-size effects will effectively raise the ground state energy, masking the
presence of the tachyon for moderate values of $c > 1$. It thus appears likely
that simulations for $c=2,3 \ldots$ on numerically accessible lattices will
fail to even capture the qualitative behavior of the continuum limit.
