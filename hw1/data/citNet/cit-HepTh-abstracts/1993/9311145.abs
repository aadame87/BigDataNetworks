  Two possibile applications of the optimized expansion for the free energy of
the quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator are discussed. The first method is
for the finite temperature effective potential; the second one, for the
classical effective potential. The results of both methods show a quick
convergence and agree well with the exact free energy in the whole range of
temperatures. Postscript figures are available under request to AO email
