  We present a B\"acklund transformation (a discrete symmetry transformation)
for the self-duality equations for supersymmetric gauge theories in N-extended
super-Minkowski space ${\cal M}^{4|4N}$ for an arbitrary semisimple gauge
group. For the case of an $A_1$ gauge algebra we integrate the transformation
starting with a given solution and iterating the process we construct a
hierarchy of explicit solutions.
