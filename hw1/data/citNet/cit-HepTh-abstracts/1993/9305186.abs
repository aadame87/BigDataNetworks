  We investigate the critical behavior of the gauged NJL model (QED plus
4-fermion interaction) and the gauged Yukawa model by use of the inversion
method.
  By calculating the gauge-invariant chiral condensate in the inversion method
to the lowest order, we derive the critical line which separates the
spontaneous chiral-symmetry breaking phase from the chiral symmetric one. The
critical exponent for the chiral order parameter associated with the second
order chiral phase transition is shown to take the mean-field value together
with possible logarithmic correction to the mean-field prediction.
  All the above results are gauge-parameter independent and are compared with
the previous results obtained from the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion
propagator.
