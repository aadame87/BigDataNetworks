  The observation that $n$ pairs of para-Bose (pB) operators generate the
universal enveloping algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra
$osp(1/2n)$ is used in order to define deformed pB operators. It is shown that
these operators are an alternative to the Chevalley generators. On this
background $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$, its "Cartan-Weyl" generators and their
"supercommutation" relations are written down entirely in terms of deformed pB
operators. An analog of the Poincare- Birkhoff-Witt theorem is formulated.
