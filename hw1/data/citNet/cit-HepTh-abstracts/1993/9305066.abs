  We show that macroscopic heterotic strings, formulated as strings which wind
around a compact direction of finite but macroscopic extent, exhibit
non-trivial scattering at low energies. This occurs at order velocity squared
and may thus be described as geodesic motion on a moduli space with a
non-trivial metric which we construct. Our result is in agreement with a direct
calculation of the string scattering amplitude.
