  Two-dimensional quantum cromodynamics in the light-front frame is studied
following hamiltonian methods. The theory is quantized using the path integral
formalism and an effective theory similar to the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model is
obtained. Confinement in two dimensions is derived analyzing directly the
constraints in the path integral.
