  The inflationary scenarios suggested by the duality properties of string
cosmology in the Brans-Dicke (or String) frame are shown to correspond to
accelerated contraction (deflation) when
  Weyl-transformed to the Einstein frame. We point out that the basic virtues
of inflation (solving the flatness and horizon problems, amplifying vacuum
fluctuations, etc.) have physically equivalent counterparts in the deflationary
(Einstein-frame) picture. This could be the answer to some objections recently
raised to superstring cosmology.
