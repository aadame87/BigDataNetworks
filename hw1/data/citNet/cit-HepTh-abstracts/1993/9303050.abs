  Based upon the formalism of conformal field theory with a boundary, we give a
description of the boundary effect on fully developed two dimensional
turbulence. Exact one and two point velocity correlation functions and energy
power spectrum confined in the upper half plane are obtained using the image
method. This result enables us to address the infrared problem of the theory of
conformal turbulence.
