  Abstrac: It is shown that an antisymmetric rank-two tensor gauge potential of
the type first found in string and supersymmetry theories occurs also in
ordinary Yang-Mills theory when formulated in loop space, where it appears as a
Lagrange multiplier for a zero curvature constraint necessary and sufficient
for removing the inherent redundancy of loop variables. It is then further
shown that the tensor potential acts there as the parallel `phase' transport
for monopoles. (hep-th/yymmnnn)
