  The partition function of the discretized superstring in a target superspace
of three (Euclidean) bosonic dimensions, is shown, for a fixed triangulation of
the random world sheet, to be derived from the partition function of a
discretized bosonic string with an external field present in the action in the
form of a specific constant matrix, using first order forms of the actions.
This latter partition function appears more amenable to an exact analytical
treatment.
