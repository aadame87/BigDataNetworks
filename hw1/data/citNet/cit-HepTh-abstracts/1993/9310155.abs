  Based on our previous work, in which a model of two dimensional dilaton
gravity of the type proposed by Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger was
rigorously quantized, we explicitly demonstrate how one can extract space-time
geometry in exactly solvable theory of quantum gravity. In particular, we have
been able to produce a prototypical configuration in which a ( smeared ) matter
shock wave generates a black hole without naked sigularity.
