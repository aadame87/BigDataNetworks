Title: Wave-type Solutions in the Nonlinear $\sigma$-model with the Dilaton
Authors: Eugene Tyurin

\\
  We study a class of classical dilaton vacua in string theory that depend on
the light-cone variable $z=t\pm x$ and, thus, have wavelike behavior. One of
the interesting results is the existence of a solution subclass with perfectly
regular space-time geometry, where the string coupling constant can be made
arbitrarily small.
