  We calculate the one-loop perturbative correction to the coefficient of the
\cs term in non-abelian gauge theory in the presence of Higgs fields, with a
variety of symmetry-breaking structures. In the case of a residual $U(1)$
symmetry, radiative corrections do not change the coefficient of the \cs term.
In the case of an unbroken non-abelian subgroup, the coefficient of the
relevant \cs term (suitably normalized) attains an integral correction, as
required for consistency of the quantum theory. Interestingly, this coefficient
arises purely from the unbroken non-abelian sector in question; the orthogonal
sector makes no contribution. This implies that the coefficient of the \cs term
is a discontinuous function over the phase diagram of the theory.
