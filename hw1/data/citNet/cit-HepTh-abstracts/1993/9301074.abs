  The higher-spin geometries of $W_\infty$-gravity and
$W_N$-gravity are analysed and used to derive the complete non-linear
structure of the coupling to matter and its symmetries. The symmetry group is a
subgroup of the symplectic diffeomorphisms of the cotangent bundle of the
world-sheet, and the $W_N$ geometry is obtained from a non-linear truncation of
the $W_\infty$ geometry. Quantum W-gravity is briefly discussed. (Talk given at
{\it Pathways to Fundamental Interactions}, the 16th John Hopkins Workshop on
Current Problems in Particle Theory, Gothenborg, 1992.)
