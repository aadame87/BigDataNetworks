  By quantizing the generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction scheme for arbitrary
$sl_2$ embeddings we show that a large set $\cal W$ of quantum W algebras can
be viewed as (BRST) cohomologies of affine Lie algebras. The set $\cal W$
contains many known $W$ algebras such as $W_N$ and $W_3^{(2)}$. Our formalism
yields a completely algorithmic method for calculating the W algebra generators
and their operator product expansions, replacing the cumbersome construction of
W algebras as commutants of screening operators. By generalizing and quantizing
the Miura transformation we show that any $W$ algebra in $\cal W$ can be
embedded into the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple affine Lie
algebra which is, up to shifts in level, isomorphic to a subalgebra of the
original affine algebra. Therefore {\em any} realization of this semisimple
affine Lie algebra leads to a realization of the $W$ algebra. In particular,
one obtains in this way a general and explicit method for constructing the free
field realizations and Fock resolutions for all algebras in $\cal W$. Some
examples are explicitly worked out.
