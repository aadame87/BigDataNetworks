Title: N=2 Superconformal Theories and their Integrable Deformations
Authors: J.-B. Zuber
Comments: (11 pages)
\\
  After a short review of the algebraic setting of N=2 superconformal field
theories, their chiral ring and their perturbations, I present some recent
results on curious relations between the integrability of their perturbations
and algebraic properties of their deformed chiral ring. (Lecture given at
Hang-zhou, China, Sept 1993)
