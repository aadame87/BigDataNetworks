  We analyze the microscopic, topological structure of the interface between
domains of opposite magnetization in 3D Ising model near the critical point.
This interface exhibits a fractal behaviour with a high density of handles. The
mean area is an almost linear function of the genus. The entropy exponent is
affected by strong finite-size effects.
