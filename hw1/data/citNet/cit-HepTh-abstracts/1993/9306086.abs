  We report results of an investigation of relativistic causality constraints
on the measurability of nonlocal variables. We show that measurability of
certain nondegenerate variables with entangled eigenstates contradicts the
principle of causality, but that there are other, certainly nonlocal, variables
which can be measured without breaking causality. We show that any causal
measurement of nonlocal variables must erase certain local information. For
example, for a system of two spin-1/2 particles, even if we take the weakest
possible definition of verification measurement, verification of an entangled
state must erase all local information.
