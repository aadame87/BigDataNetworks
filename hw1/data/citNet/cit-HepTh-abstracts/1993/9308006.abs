  We generalize to composite operators concepts and techniques which have been
successful in proving renormalization of the effective Action in light-cone
gauge. Gauge invariant operators can be grouped into classes, closed under
renormalization, which is matrix-wise. In spite of the presence of non-local
counterterms, an ``effective" dimensional hierarchy still guarantees that any
class is endowed with a finite number of elements. The main result we find is
that gauge invariant operators under renormalization mix only among themselves,
thanks to the very simple structure of Lee-Ward identities in this gauge,
contrary to their behaviour in covariant gauges.
