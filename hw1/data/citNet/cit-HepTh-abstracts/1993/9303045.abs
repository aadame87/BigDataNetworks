  We reexamine the $W_{\infty}$ symmetry of the $sl(N)$ Conformal Affine Toda
theories. It is shown that it is possible to reduce (nonuniquely) the zero
curvature equation to a Lax equation for a first order pseudodifferential
oprator, whose coefficients are the generators of the $W_{\infty}$ algebra.
This clarifies the known relation between the Conformal Affine Toda theories
and the KP hierarchy. A possible correspondence between the matrix models and
the Conformal Affine Toda models is discussed.
