  We consider a macroscopic charge-current carrying (cosmic) string in the
background of a Schwarzschild black hole. The string is taken to be circular
and is allowed to oscillate and to propagate in the direction perpendicular to
its plane (that is parallel to the equatorial plane of the black hole).
Nurmerical investigations indicate that the system is non-integrable, but the
interaction with the gravitational field of the black hole anyway gives rise to
various qualitatively simple processes like "adiabatic capture" and "string
transmutation".
