  The finite temperature one-loop effective potential for a scalar field
defined on an ultrastatic spacetime, whose spatial part is a compact hyperbolic
manifold, is studied. Different analytic expressions, especially valuable at
low and high temperature are derived. Based on these results, the symmetry
breaking and the topological mass generation are discussed.
