  The Poincare invariance in the temporal gauge canonical quantization of QCD
is shown manifestly by verifying the energy-momentum-vector and
angular-momentum-tensor satisfy the Poincare algebra in the physical Hilbert
space. Two different values of \(\theta\) for the $\theta$-term in QCD
lagrangian lead to different representations of the Poincare group, which are,
however, connected by an unitary transformation. Thus the parameter \(\theta\)
becomes physically irrelevant unless we can further restrict the physical
Hilbert space.
