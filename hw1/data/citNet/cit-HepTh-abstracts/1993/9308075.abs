  In 1973 two Salam prot\'{e}g\'{e}s (Derek Capper and the author) discovered
that the conformal invariance under Weyl rescalings of the metric tensor
$g_{\mu\nu}(x)\rightarrow\Omega^2(x)g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ displayed by classical
massless field systems in interaction with gravity no longer survives in the
quantum theory. Since then these Weyl anomalies have found a variety of
applications in black hole physics, cosmology, string theory and statistical
mechanics. We give a nostalgic review. (Talk given at the {\it Salamfest},
ICTP, Trieste, March 1993.)
