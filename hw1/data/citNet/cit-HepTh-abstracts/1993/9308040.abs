  The eigenvalues of the Corner Transfer Matrix Hamiltonian associated to the
elliptic $R$ matrix of the eight vertex free fermion model are computed in the
anisotropic case for magnetic field smaller than the critical value. An
argument based on generating functions is given, and the results are checked
numerically. The spectrum consists of equally spaced levels.
