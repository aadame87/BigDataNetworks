Title: Extended Structures in Topological Quantum Field Theory
Author: Daniel S. Freed
Comments: 11 pages + 2 figures
\\
  In this note, based on a conference talk, we show how a 3 dimensional
topological field theory leads to an algebraic gadget roughly equivalent to a
quantum group. This is an expository version of some material in hep-th/9212115
(where we also carry out computations for a specific finite example). We also
explain how to incorporate the central extensions usually explained via
``framings'', and we show how to recover invariants of framed tangles. This
paper is written using AMSTeX 2.1, which can be obtained via ftp from the
American Mathematical Society (instructions included). 2 encapsulated
postscript files were submitted separately in uuencoded tar-compressed format.
