  Classical integrable Hamiltonian systems generated by elements of the Poisson
commuting ring of spectral invariants on rational coadjoint orbits of the loop
algebra $\wt{\gr{gl}}^{+*}(2,{\bf R})$ are integrated by separation of
variables in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in hyperellipsoidal coordinates. The
canonically quantized systems are then shown to also be completely integrable
and separable within the same coordinates. Pairs of second class constraints
defining reduced phase spaces are implemented in the quantized systems by
choosing one constraint as an invariant, and interpreting the other as
determining a quotient (i.e., by treating one as a first class constraint and
the other as a gauge condition). Completely integrable, separable systems on
spheres and ellipsoids result, but those on ellipsoids require a further
modification of order $\OO(\hbar^2)$ in the commuting invariants in order to
assure self-adjointness and to recover the Laplacian for the case of free
motion. For each case - in the ambient space ${\bf R}^{n}$, the sphere and the
ellipsoid - the Schr\"odinger equations are completely separated in
hyperellipsoidal coordinates, giving equations of generalized Lam\'e type.
