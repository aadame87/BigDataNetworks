  We compare the vortex-like solutions of two different theories in (2+1)
dimensions. In the first a nonrelativistic field self-interacts through a
Chern-Simons gauge connection. It is $P$ and $T$ violating. The second is the
standard Maxwell scalar electrodynamics. We show that for specific values of
some parameters the same vortex-configurations provide solutions for both
theories.
