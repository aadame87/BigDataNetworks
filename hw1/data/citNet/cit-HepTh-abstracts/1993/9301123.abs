  By considering corrections to the asymptotic scaling functions of the photon
and electron in quantum electrodynamics with $\Nf$ flavours, we solve the
skeleton Dyson equations at $O(1/\Nf)$ in the large $\Nf$ expansion at the
$d$-dimensional critical point of the theory and deduce the critical exponent
$\beta^\prime(g_c)$, in arbitrary dimensions, and subsequently present a method
for computing higher order corrections to $\beta(g)$.
