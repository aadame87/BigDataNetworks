Title: Yang-Baxter equation in spin chains with long range interactions

\\
  We consider the $ su(n) $ spin chains with long range interactions and the
spin generalization of the Calogero-Sutherland models. We show that their
properties derive from a transfer matrix obeying the Yang-Baxter equation. We
obtain the expression of the conserved quantities and we diagonalize them.
