  The method of quantization of magnetic monopoles based on the order-disorder
duality existing between the monopole operator and the lagrangian fields is
applied to the description of the quantum magnetic monopoles of `t Hooft and
Polyakov in the SO(3) Georgi-Glashow model.
  The commutator of the monopole operator with the magnetic charge is computed
explicitly, indicating that indeed the quantum monopole carries $4\pi/g$ units
of magnetic charge. An explicit expression for the asymptotic behavior of the
monopole correlation function is derived. From this, the mass of the quantum
monopole is obtained. The tree-level result for the quantum monopole mass is
shown to satisfy the Bogomolnyi bound ($M_{\rm mon} \geq 4 \pi \frac{M}{g^2}$)
and to be within the range of values found for the energy of the classical
monopole solution.
