  We investigate the phase structure of four-dimensional quantum gravity
coupled to Ising spins or Gaussian scalar fields by means of numerical
simulations.
  The quantum gravity part is modelled by the summation over random simplicial
manifolds, and the matter fields are located in the center of the 4-simplices,
which constitute the building blocks of the manifolds. We find that the
coupling between spin and geometry is weak away from the critical point of the
Ising model. At the critical point there is clear coupling, which qualitatively
agrees with that of gaussian fields coupled to gravity. In the case of pure
gravity a transition between a phase with highly connected geometry and a phase
with very ``dilute'' geometry has been observed earlier. The nature of this
transition seems unaltered when matter fields are included.
  It was the hope that continuum physics could be extracted at the transition
between the two types of geometries. The coupling to matter fields, at least in
the form discussed in this paper, seems not to improve the scaling of the
curvature at the transition point.
