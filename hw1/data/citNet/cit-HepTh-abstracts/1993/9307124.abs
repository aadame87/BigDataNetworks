  We extend the recent approach of M. Jimbo, K. Miki, T. Miwa, and A.
Nakayashiki to derive an integral formula for the N-point correlation functions
of arbitrary local operators of the antiferromagnetic spin-1 XXZ model. For
this, we realize the quantum affine symmetry algebra $U_q(su(2)_2)$ of level 2
and its corresponding type I vertex operators in terms of a deformed bosonic
field free of a background charge, and a deformed fermionic field. Up to GSO
type projections, the Fock space is already irreducible and therefore no BRST
projections are involved. This means that no screening charges with their
Jackson integrals are required. Consequently, our N-point correlation functions
are given in terms of usual classical integrals only, just as those derived by
Jimbo et al in the case of the spin-1/2 XXZ model through the Frenkel-Jing
bosonization of $U_q(su(2)_1)$.
