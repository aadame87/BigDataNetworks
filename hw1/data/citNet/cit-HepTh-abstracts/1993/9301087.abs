  Four apparently different bosonizations of the $U_q(su(2)_k)$ quantum current
algebra for arbitrary level $k$ have recently been proposed in the literature.
However, the relations among them have so far remained unclear except in one
case. Assuming a special standard form for the $U_q(su(2)_k)$ quantum currents,
we derive a set of general consistency equations that must be satisfied. As
particular solutions of this set of equations, we recover two of the four
bosonizations and we derive a new and simpler one. Moreover, we show that the
latter three, and the remaining two bosonizations which cannot be derived
directly from this set of equations since by construction they do not have the
standard form, are all related to each other through some redefinitions of
their Heisenberg boson oscillators.
