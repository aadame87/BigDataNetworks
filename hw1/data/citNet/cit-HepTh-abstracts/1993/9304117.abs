  Recent numerical results on the fractal structure of two-dimensional quantum
gravity coupled to $c=-2$ matter are reviewed. Analytic derivation of the
fractal dimensions based on the Liouville theory and diffusion equation is also
discussed. Excellent agreements between the numerical and theoretical results
are obtained. Some problems on the non-universal nature of the fractal
structure in the continuum limit are pointed out.
