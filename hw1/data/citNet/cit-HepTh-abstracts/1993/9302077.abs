  We construct a quantum Hamiltonian operator for the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW)
model in terms of the Casimir operator. This facilitates the discussion of the
reduction of the WZW model to Toda field theory at the quantum level and
provides a very straightforward derivation of the quantum central charge for
the Toda field theory.
