  The paper introduces a new geometric interpretation of the quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations introduced in 1991 by I.Frenkel and
N.Reshetikhin. It turns out that these equations can be linked to certain
holomorphic vector bundles on the N-th Cartesian power of an elliptic curve.
These bundles are naturally constructed by a gluing procedure from a system of
trigonometric quantum affine $R$-matrices. Meromorphic solutions of the quantum
KZ equations are interpreted as sections of such a bundle. This interpretation
is an analogue of the interpretation of solutions of the classical KZ equations
as sections of a flat vector bundle. Matrix elements of intertwiners between
representations of the quantum affine algebra correspond to regular
(holomorphic) sections. The vector bundle obtained from the quantum KZ system
is topologically nontrivial. Its topology can be completely described in terms
of crystal bases, using the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. In the case N=2,
this bundle is is essentially a bundle on an elliptic curve which is shown to
be semistable (for the case of quantum sl(2)) if the parameters take generic
values. The proof makes use of the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. Finally, we
give a vector bundle interpretation of the generalized quantum KZ equations for
arbitrary affine root systems defined recently by Cherednik.
