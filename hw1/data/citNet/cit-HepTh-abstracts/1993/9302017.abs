  The submitted paper regards the example of the Conformal Field Theory on a 2d
manifold which metric has a point-like singularity.Since this manifold is not
conformally equivalent to that with the flat space-time metric,it's naturally
to expect that the theory cannot be trivially reduced to the well-known
consideration of the CFT on a plane,and some modifications are
needed.Particularly,this paper shows how the vacuum of the theory on a singular
surface differs from the vacuum of the BPZ theory.Namely,this vacuum would not
be SL(2,C)-invariant and the expressions for the correlation functions should
be modified. As a consequence of that,some "effective mass" is brought to the
theory.
