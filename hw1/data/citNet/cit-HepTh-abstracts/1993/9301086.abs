  Product forms of characters of Virasoro minimal models are obtained which
factorize into $(2,\odd)\times(3,\even)$ characters. These are related by
generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities to sum forms allowing for a
quasiparticle interpretation. The corresponding dilogarithm identities are
given and the factorization is used to analyse the related path space structure
as well as the fusion of the maximally extended chiral algebra.
