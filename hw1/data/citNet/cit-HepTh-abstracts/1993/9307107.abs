  Mappings between certain infinite series of N=2 superconformal coset models
are constructed. They make use of level-rank dualities for B, C and D type
theories. While the WZW level-rank dualities do not constitute isomorphisms of
the theories, they lead to level-rank dualities of N=2 coset models that
preserve the cft properties in such a manner that the coset models related by
duality are expected to be isomorphic as conformal field theories. The
construction also gives some further insight in the nature of the resolution of
field identification fixed points of coset theories.
