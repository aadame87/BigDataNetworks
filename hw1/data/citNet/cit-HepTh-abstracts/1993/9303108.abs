  We derive the recursive equations for the form factors of the local hermitian
operators in the Bullough-Dodd model. At the self-dual point of the theory, the
form factors of the fundamental field of the Bullough-Dodd model are equal to
those of the fundamental field of the Sinh-Gordon model at a specific value of
the coupling constant.
