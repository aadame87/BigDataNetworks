  The relation between Geisteswissenschaft and Naturwissenschaft has been
discussed by Munster in hep-th/9305104. The plan of this paper is to begin with
the empty set; use it to form sets and quivers (sets of points plus sets of
arrows between pairs of points); and then use them to make complex vector
spaces and to get the A-D-E Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. The Dn Spin(2n) Lie
algebras have spinor representations to describe fermions. D4 Spin(8) triality
gives automorphisms among its vector and two half-spinor representations. D5
Spin(10) contains both Spin(8) and the complexification of the vector
representation of Spin(8). E6 contains both Spin(10) and the two half-spinor
representations of Spin(10), and therefore contains the adjoint representation
of Spin(8) and the complexifications of the vector and the two half-spinor
representations of Spin(8). E6 is the basis for construction of a fundamental
model of physics that is consistent with experiment (see hep-th/9302030,
hep-ph/9301210).
