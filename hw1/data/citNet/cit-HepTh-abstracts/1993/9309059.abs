  The Peierls bracket quantization scheme is applied to the supersymmetric
system corresponding to the twisted spin index theorem. A detailed study of the
quantum system is presented, and the Feynman propagator is exactly computed.
The Green's function methods provide a direct derivation of the index formula.
Note: This is essentially a new SUSY proof of the index theorem.
