  The equations of motion for the position and spin of a classical particle
coupled to an external electromagnetic and gravitational potential are derived
from an action principle. The constraints insuring a correct number of
independent spin components are automatically satisfied. In general the spin is
not Fermi-Walker transported nor does the position follow a geodesic, although
the deviations are small for most situations.
