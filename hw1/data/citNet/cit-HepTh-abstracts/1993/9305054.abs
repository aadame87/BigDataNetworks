  Quantum canonical transformations are defined algebraically outside of a
Hilbert space context. This generalizes the quantum canonical transformations
of Weyl and Dirac to include non-unitary transformations. The importance of
non-unitary transformations for constructing solutions of the Schr\"odinger
equation is discussed. Three elementary canonical transformations are shown
both to have quantum implementations as finite transformations and to generate,
classically and infinitesimally, the full canonical algebra. A general
canonical transformation can be realized quantum mechanically as a product of
these transformations. Each transformation corresponds to a familiar tool used
in solving differential equations, and the procedure of solving a differential
equation is systematized by the use of the canonical transformations. Several
examples are done to illustrate the use of the canonical transformations. [This
is an extensively revised version of hep-th-9205080: the first third of the
paper is new material; the notation has been simplified, and further discussion
has been added to the remainder.]
