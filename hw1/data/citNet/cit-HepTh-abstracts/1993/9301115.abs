  The exactness and universality observed in the quantum Hall effect suggests
the existence of a symmetry principle underlying Laughlin's theory. We review
the role played by the infinite $W_{\infty }$ and conformal algebras as
dynamical symmetries of incompressible quantum fluids and show how they predict
universal finite-size effects in the excitation spectrum.
