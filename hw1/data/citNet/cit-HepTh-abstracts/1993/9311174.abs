  In the numerical simulation of certain field theoretical models, the complex
Langevin simulation has been believed to fail due to the violation of
ergodicity. We give a detailed analysis of this problem based on a toy model
with one degree of freedom ($S=-\beta\cos\theta$). We find that the failure is
not due to the defect of complex Langevin simulation itself, but rather to the
way how one treats the singularity appearing in the drift force. An effective
algorithm is proposed by which one can simulate the ${1/\beta}$ behaviour of
the expectation value $<\cos\theta>$ in the small $\beta$ limit.
