  Most nonabelian gauge theories admit the existence of conserved and quantized
topological charges as generalizations of the Dirac monopole. Their
interactions are dictated by topology. In this paper, previous work in deriving
classical equations of motion for these charges is extended to quantized
particles described by Dirac wave functions. The resulting equations show
intriguing similarities to the Yang-Mills theory. Further, although the system
is not dual symmetric, its gauge symmetry is nevertheless doubled as in the
abelian case from $G$ to $G \times G$, where the second $G$ has opposite parity
to the first but is mediated instead by an antisymmetric second-rank tensor
potential. (hep-th/yymmnnn)
