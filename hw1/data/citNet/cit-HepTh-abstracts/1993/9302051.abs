  The one-loop effective potential for a scalar field defined on an ultrastatic
space-time whose spatial part is a compact hyperbolic manifold, is studied
using zeta-function regularization for the one-loop effective action. Other
possible regularizations are discussed in detail. The renormalization group
equations are derived and their connection with the conformal anomaly is
pointed out. The symmetry breaking and the topological mass generation are also
discussed.
