  I propose a new mathematical form for the quantum theory of gravity coupled
to matter. The motivation is from the connection between CSW TQFT and the
Ashtekar variables. I also connect the algebraic structure of TQFT with some
thoughts about the interpretation of quantum mechanics in a general
relativistic setting.
