  In this paper we present a new series of 3-dimensional integrable lattice
models with $N$ colors. The case $N=2$ generalizes the elliptic model of our
previous paper. The weight functions of the models satisfy modified tetrahedron
equations with $N$ states and give a commuting family of two-layer
transfer-matrices. The dependence on the spectral parameters corresponds to the
static limit of the modified tetrahedron equations and weights are
parameterized in terms of elliptic functions. The models contain two free
parameters: elliptic modulus and additional parameter $\eta$. Also we briefly
discuss symmetry properties of weight functions of the models.
