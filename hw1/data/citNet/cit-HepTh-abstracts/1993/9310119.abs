  Using $U_q[SU(2)]$ tensor calculus we compute the two-point scalar operators
(TPSO), their averages on the ground-state give the two-point correlation
functions. The TPSOs are identified as elements of the Temperley-Lieb algebra
and a recurrence relation is given for them. We have not tempted to derive the
analytic expressions for the correlation functions in the general case but got
some partial results. For $q=e^{i \pi/3}$, all correlation functions are
(trivially) zero, for $q=e^{i \pi/4}$, they are related in the continuum to the
correlation functions of left-handed and right-handed Majorana fields in the
half plane coupled by the boundary condition. In the case $q=e^{i \pi/6}$, one
gets the correlation functions of Mittag's and Stephen's parafermions for the
three-state Potts model. A diagrammatic approach to compute correlation
functions is also presented.
