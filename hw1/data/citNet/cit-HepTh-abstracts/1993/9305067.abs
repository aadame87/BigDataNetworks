  Bosonic q-oscillators commute with themselves and so their free distribution
is Planckian. In a cavity, their emission and absorption rates may grow or
shrink---and even diverge---but they nevertheless balance to yield the Planck
distribution via Einstein's equilibrium method, (a careless application of
which might produce spurious q-dependent distribution functions). This drives
home the point that the black-body energy distribution is not a handle for
distinguishing q-excitations from plain oscillators. A maximum cavity size is
suggested by the inverse critical frequency of such emission/absorption rates
at a given temperature, or a maximum temperature at a given frequency. To
remedy fragmentation of opinion on the subject, we provide some discussion,
context, and references.
