Title: On the Classicality of Broda's SU(2) Invariant of 4-manifolds
Author: Louis Crane, Louis H. Kauffman, David N. Yetter
Comments: 4 pages (revised to state correctly Lemma 1--the correct lemma was
  proved, and used throughout, but the original statement jumbled some
  phrases--and add an explanatory footnote on an abuse of language)
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Algebra

  Recent work of Roberts has shown that the first surgical 4-manifold invariant
of Broda and (up to an unspecified normalization factor) the state-sum
invariant arising from the TQFT of Crane-Yetter are equivalent to the signature
of the 4-manifold. Subsequently Broda defined another surgical invariant in
which the 1- and 2-handles are treated differently. We use a refinement of
Roberts' techniques developped by the authors in hep-th/9309063 to show that
the "improved" surgical invariant of Broda also depends only on the signature
and Euler character
