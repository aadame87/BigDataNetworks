  Using the fusion principle of Bauer et al. we give explicit expressions for
some null vectors in the highest weight representations of the \bc algebra in
two different forms. These null vectors are the generalization of the Virasoro
ones described by Benoit and Saint-Aubin and analogues of the $W_3$ ones
constructed by Bowcock and Watts. We find connection between quantum Toda
models and the fusion method.
