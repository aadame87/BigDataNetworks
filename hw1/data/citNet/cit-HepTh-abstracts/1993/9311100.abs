  We introduce selfdual Maxwell-Higgs systems with uniform background electric
charge density and show that the selfdual equations satisfied by topological
vortices can be reduced to the original Bogomol'nyi equations without any
background. These vortices are shown to carry no spin but to feel the Magnus
force due to the shielding charge carried by the Higgs field. We also study the
dynamics of slowly moving vortices and show that the spin-statistics theorem
holds to our vortices.
