Title: Duality as a Gauge Symmetry and Topology Change

  Duality groups as (spontaneously broken) gauge symmetries for toroidal
backgrounds, and their role in ($\infty$-dimensional) underlying string gauge
algebras are reviewed. For curved backgrounds, it is shown that there is a
duality in the moduli space of WZNW sigma-models, that can be interpreted as a
broken gauge symmetry. In particular, this duality relates the backgrounds
corresponding to axially gauged abelian cosets, $G/U(1)_a$, to vectorially
gauged abelian cosets, $G/U(1)_v$. Finally, topology change in the moduli space
of WZNW sigma-models is discussed.
