  We analyze the relation between a topological coset model based on super
$SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset and non-critical string theory by using free field
realization. We show that the twisted $N=2$ algebra of the coset model can be
naturally transformed into that of non-critical string. The screening operators
of the coset models can be identified either with those of the minimal matters
or with the cosmological constant operator. We also find that another screening
operator, which is intrinsic in our approach, becomes the BRST nontrivial state
of ghost number $0$ (generator of the ground ring for $c=1$ gravity).
