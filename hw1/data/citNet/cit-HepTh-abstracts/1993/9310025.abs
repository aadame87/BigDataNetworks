  We discuss general properties of the conservation law associated with a local
symmetry. Using Noether's theorem and a generalized Belinfante symmetrization
procedure in 3+1 dimensions, a symmetric energy-momentum (pseudo) tensor for
the gravitational Einstein-Hilbert action is derived and discussed in detail.
In 2+1 dimensions, expressions are obtained for energy and angular momentum
arising in the $ISO(2,1)$ gauge theoretical formulation of Einstein gravity. In
addition, an expression for energy in a gauge theoretical formulation of the
string-inspired 1+1 dimensional gravity is derived and compared with the ADM
definition of energy.
