  We discuss the functional Schroedinger picture for fermions in external
fields for both stationary and time-dependent problems. We give formal results
for the ground state and the solution of the time-dependent Schroedinger
equation for QED in arbitrary dimensions, while more explicit results are
obtained in two dimensions. For both the massless and massive Schwinger model
we give an explicit expression for the ground state functional as well as for
the expectation values of energy, electric and axial charge. We also give the
corresponding results for non-abelian fields. We solve the functional
Schroedinger equation for a constant external field in four dimensions and
obtain the amount of particle creation. We solve the Schroedinger equation for
arbitrary external fields for massless QED in two dimensions and make a careful
discussionof the anomalous particle creation rate. Finally, we discuss some
subtleties connected with the interpretation of the quantized Gauss constraint.
