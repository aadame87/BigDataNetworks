  We consider two dimensional U(N) QCD on the cylinder with a timelike Wilson
line in an arbitrary representation. We show that the theory is equivalent to N
fermions with internal degrees of freedom which interact among themselves with
a generalized Sutherland-type interaction. By evaluating the expectation value
of the Wilson line in the original theory we explicitly find the spectrum and
degeneracies of these particle systems.
