  The geometric interpretation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky antibracket as the
Schouten bracket of functional multivectors is examined in detail. The
identification is achieved by the process of repeated contraction of even
functional multivectors with fermionic functional 1-forms. The classical master
equation may then be considered as a generalisation of the Jacobi identity for
Poisson brackets, and the cohomology of a nilpotent even functional multivector
is identified with the BRST cohomology. As an example, the BRST-BV formulation
of gauge fixing in theories with gauge symmetries is reformulated in the jet
bundle formalism. (Hopefully this version will be TeXable)
