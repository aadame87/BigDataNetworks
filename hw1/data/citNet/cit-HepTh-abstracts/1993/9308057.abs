  The short distance behaviour of massive integrable quantum field theories is
analyzed in terms of the form factor approach. We show that the on-shell
dynamics is compatible with different definitions of the stress-energy tensor
$T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ of the theory. In terms of form factors, this is equivalent to
having a possible non-zero matrix element $F_1$ of the trace of $T_{\mu\nu}$ on
one-particle state. Each choice of $F_1$ induces a different scaling behaviour
of the massive theory in the ultraviolet limit.
