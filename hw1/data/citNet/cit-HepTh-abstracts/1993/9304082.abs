  Using a hybrid approach, based on the recursion relations for shape invariant
potentials developed by Das and Huang and a time-dependent tranformation of
variables, we derive the propagator for a radial oscillator. Although this is
not a new result, we explicitly show that time-dependent tranformations are
very beneficial even within the context of time-independent Hamiltonians in
quantum mechanics.
