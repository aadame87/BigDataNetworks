  The affine Toda field theories based on the non simply-laced Lie algebras are
discussed. By rewriting the S-matrix formulae found by Delius et al, a
universal form for the coupling-constant dependence of these models is
obtained, and related to various general properties of the classical couplings.
This is illustrated via the S-matrix associated with the dual pair of algebras
$f_4^{(1)}$ and $e_6^{(2)}$.
