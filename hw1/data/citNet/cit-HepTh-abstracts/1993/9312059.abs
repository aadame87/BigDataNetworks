  We review nonlinear gauge theory and its application to two-dimensional
gravity. We construct a gauge theory based on nonlinear Lie algebras, which is
an extension of the usual gauge theory based on Lie algebras. It is a new
approach to generalization of the gauge theory. The two-dimensional gravity is
derived from nonlinear Poincar{\' e} algebra, which is the new Yang-Mills like
formulation of the gravitational theory. As typical examples, we investigate
$R^2$ gravity with dynamical torsion and generic form of 'dilaton' gravity. The
supersymmetric extension of this theory is also discussed.
