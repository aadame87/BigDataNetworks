  In an abelian topologically massive gauge theory, any eigenstate of
the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into a factor describing massive
propagating gauge bosons and a Chern-Simons wave function describing
a set of nonpropagating ``topological'' excitations.  The energy
depends only on the propagating modes, and energy eigenstates thus
occur with a degeneracy that can be parametrized by the Hilbert
space of the pure Chern-Simons theory.  We show that for a
{\em nonabelian} topologically massive gauge theory, this degeneracy
is lifted: although the Gauss law constraint can be solved with
a similar factorization, the Hamiltonian couples the propagating  and
nonpropagating (topological) modes.
