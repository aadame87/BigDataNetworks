  We comment on some calculations concerning the finite-thickness corrections
to the (generalized) Nambu action for a curved domain wall in Minkowski space.
Contrary to a recent claim in the literature, we find no first order
corrections in the wall-thickness, and only one second order correction
proportional to the Ricci curvature of the wall. These results are obtained by
consistently expanding the action and the equations of motion for the scalar
field.
