  Recent results on the vacuum polarization induced by a thin string of
magnetic flux lead us to suggest an analogue of the Copenhagen `flux spaghetti'
QCD vacuum as a possible mechanism for avoiding the divergence of perturbative
QED, thus permitting consistent completion of the full, nonperturbative theory.
The mechanism appears to operate for spinor, but not scalar, QED.
