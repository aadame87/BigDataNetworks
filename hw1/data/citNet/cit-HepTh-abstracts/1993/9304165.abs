  In this paper the evolution of a quantum system drived by a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian depending on slowly-changing parameters is studied by building an
universal high-order adiabatic approximation(HOAA) method with Berry's phase
,which is valid for either the Hermitian or the non-Hermitian cases. This
method can be regarded as a non-trivial generalization of the HOAA method for
closed quantum system presented by this author before. In a general situation,
the probabilities of adiabatic decay and non-adiabatic transitions are
explicitly obtained for the evolution of the non-Hermitian quantum system. It
is also shown that the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry's phase factor for the
non-Hermitian case just enjoys the holonomy structure of the dual linear bundle
over the parameter manifold. The non-Hermitian evolution of the generalized
forced harmonic oscillator is discussed as an illustrative examples.
