  We present a second order gravity action which consists of ordinary Einstein
action augmented by a first-order, vector like, Chern-Simons quasi topological
term.This theory is ghost-free and propagates a pure spin-2 mode. It is
diffeomorphism invariant, although its local Lorentz invariance has been
spontaneously broken.
