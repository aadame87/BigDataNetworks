  We describe the Hamiltonian reduction of the coajoint Kac-Moody orbits to the
Virasoro coajoint orbits explicitly in terms of the Lagrangian approach for the
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten theory. While a relation of the coajoint Virasoro
orbit $Diff \; S^1 /SL(2,R)$ to the Liouville theory has been already studied
we analyse the role of special coajoint Virasoro orbits $Diff \;
S^1/\tilde{T}_{\pm ,n}$ corresponding to stabilizers generated by the vector
fields with double zeros. The orbits with stabilizers with single zeros do not
appear in the model. We find an interpretation of zeros $x_i$ of the vector
field of stabilizer $\tilde{T}_{\pm ,n}$ and additional parameters $q_i$, $i =
1,...,n$, in terms of quantum mechanics for $n$ point particles on the circle.
We argue that the special orbits are generated by insertions of "wrong sign"
Liouville exponential into the path integral. The additional parmeters $q_i$
are naturally interpreted as accessory parameters for the uniformization map.
Summing up the contributions of the special Virasoro orbits we get the
integrable sinh-Gordon type theory.
