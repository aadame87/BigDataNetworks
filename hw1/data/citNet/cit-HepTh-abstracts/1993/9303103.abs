  A derivation of the Hawking effect is given which avoids reference to field
modes above some cutoff frequency $\omega_c\gg M^{-1}$ in the free-fall frame
of the black hole. To avoid reference to arbitrarily high frequencies, it is
necessary to impose a boundary condition on the quantum field in a timelike
region near the horizon, rather than on a (spacelike) Cauchy surface either
outside the horizon or at early times before the horizon forms. Due to the
nature of the horizon as an infinite redshift surface, the correct boundary
condition at late times outside the horizon cannot be deduced, within the
confines of a theory that applies only below the cutoff, from initial
conditions prior to the formation of the hole. A boundary condition is
formulated which leads to the Hawking effect in a cutoff theory. It is argued
that it is possible the boundary condition is {\it not} satisfied, so that the
spectrum of black hole radiation may be significantly different from that
predicted by Hawking, even without the back-reaction near the horizon becoming
of order unity relative to the curvature.
