  Using the algebraic Hamiltonian approach, we derive the exact to all orders
O(d,d) transformations of the metric and the dilaton field in WZW and WZW coset
models for both compact and non-compact groups. It is shown that under the
exact $O(d)\times O(d)$ transformation only the leading order of the inverse
metric $G^{-1}$ is transformed. The quantity $\sqrt{G}\exp(\Phi)$ is the same
in all the dual models and in particular is independent of k. We also show that
the exact metric and dilaton field that correspond to G/U(1)^d WZW can be
obtained by applying the exact O(d,d) transformations on the (ungauged) WZW, a
result that was known to one loop order only. As an example we give the O(2,2)
transformations in the $SL(2,R)$ WZW that transform to its dual exact models.
These include also the exact 3D black string and the exact 2D black hole with
an extra $U(1)$ free field.
