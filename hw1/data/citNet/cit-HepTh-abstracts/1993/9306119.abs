Title: Connection on the theory space

  By studying the geometric properties of correlation functions on the theory
space, we are naturally led to a connection for the infinite dimensional vector
bundle of composite fields over the theory space. We show how the short
distance singularities of the theory are determined by the geometry of the
theory space, i.e., the connection, beta functions, and anomalous dimensions.
