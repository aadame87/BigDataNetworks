  The structure of ground states of generic FQH states on a torus is studied by
using both effective theory and electron wave function. The relation between
the effective theory and the wave function becomes transparent when one
considers the ground state structure. We find that the non-abelian Berry's
phases of the abelian Hall states generated by twisting the mass matrix are
identical to the modular transformation matrix for the characters of a Gaussian
conformal field theory. We also show that the Haldane-Rezayi spin singlet state
has a ten fold degeneracy on a torus which indicates such a state is a
non-abelian Hall state.
