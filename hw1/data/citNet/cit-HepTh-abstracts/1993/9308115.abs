  We analyze the Gribov problem for $\SU(N)$ and $\U(N)$ Yang-Mills fields on
$d$-dimensional tori, $d=2,3,\ldots$. We give an improved version of the axial
gauge condition and find an infinite, discrete group
$\cG'=\Z^{dr}\rtimes({\Z_2}^{N-1}\rtimes\Z_2)$, where $r=N-1$ for $\GG=\SU(N)$
and $r=N$ for $\GG=\U(N)$, containing all gauge transformations compatible with
that condition. This residual gauge group $\cG'$ provides (generically) all
Gribov copies and allows to explicitly determine the space of gauge orbits
which is an orbifold. Our results apply to Yang-Mills gauge theories either in
the Lagrangian approach on $d$-dimensional space-time $T^d$, or in the
Hamiltonian approach on $(d+1)$-dimensional space-time $T^d\times \R$. Using
the latter, we argue that our results imply a non-trivial structure of all
physical states in any Yang-Mills theory, especially if also matter fields are
present.
