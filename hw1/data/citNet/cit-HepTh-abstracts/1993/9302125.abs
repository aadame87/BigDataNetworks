\\
  Bracket preserving gauge equivalence is established between several two-boson
generated KP type of hierarchies. These KP hierarchies reduce under symplectic
reduction (via Dirac constraints) to KdV, mKdV and Schwarzian KdV hierarchies.
Under this reduction the gauge equivalence is taking form of the conventional
Miura maps between the above KdV type of hierarchies.
