  Using the ideas of supersymmetry and shape invariance we show that the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a wide class of noncentral potentials can be
obtained in a closed form by the operator method. This generalization
considerably extends the list of exactly solvable potentials for which the
solution can be obtained algebraically in a simple and elegant manner. As an
illustration, we discuss in detail the example of the potential
$$V(r,\theta,\phi)={\omega^2\over 4}r^2 + {\delta\over r^2}+{C\over r^2
sin^2\theta}+{D\over r^2 cos^2\theta} + {F\over r^2 sin^2\theta sin^2
\alpha\phi} +{G\over r^2 sin^2\theta cos^2\alpha\phi}$$ with 7 parameters.Other
algebraically solvable examples are also given.
