  The spectrum and partition function of a model consisting of SU(n) spins
positioned at the equilibrium positions of a classical Calogero model and
interacting through inverse-square exchange are derived. The energy levels are
equidistant and have a high degree of degeneracy, with several SU(n) multiplets
belonging to the same energy eigenspace. The partition function takes the form
of a q-deformed polynomial. This leads to a description of the system by means
of an effective parafermionic hamiltonian, and to a classification of the
states in terms of "modules" consisting of base-n strings of integers.
