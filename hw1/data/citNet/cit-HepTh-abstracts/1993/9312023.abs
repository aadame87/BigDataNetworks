  A free differential for an arbitrary associative algebra is defined as a
differential with a uniqueness property. The existence problem for such a
differential is posed. The notion of optimal calculi for given commutation
rules is introduced and an explicit construction of it for a homogenous case is
provided. Some examples are presented.
