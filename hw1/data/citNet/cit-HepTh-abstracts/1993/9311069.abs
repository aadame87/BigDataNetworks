  These notes correspond rather accurately to the translation of the lectures
given at the Fifth Mexican School of Particles and Fields, held in Guanajuato,
Gto., in December~1992. They constitute a brief and elementary introduction to
quantum symmetries from a physical point of view, along the lines of the
forthcoming book by C. G\'omez, G. Sierra and myself.
