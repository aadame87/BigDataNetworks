  We use a Hodge decomposition and its generalization to non-abelian flat
vector bundles to calculate the partition function for abelian and non- abelian
BF theories in $n$ dimensions. This enables us to provide a simple proof that
the partition function is related to the Ray-Singer torsion defined on flat
vector bundles for all odd-dimensional manifolds, and is equal to unity for
even dimensions.
