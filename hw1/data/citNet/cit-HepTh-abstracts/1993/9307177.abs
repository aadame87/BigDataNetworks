  We investigate extremal electrically charged black holes in
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with a cosmological constant inspired by string
theory. These solutions are not static, and a timelike singularity eventually
appears which is not surrounded by an event horizon. This suggests that cosmic
censorship may be violated in this theory.
