  We consider a simplified model of particles with effectively distance
dependent statistics, that is particles coupled to a gauge field the Lagrangian
of which contains the Chern-Simons term. We analyze the low-lying states of the
two-particle system and show that under certain conditions they can exhibit
negative compressibility, hinting on a possible \`a la van der Vaals picture.
