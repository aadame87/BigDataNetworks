  We study a topological Yang-Mills theory with $N=2$ fermionic symmetry. Our
formalism is a field theoretical interpretation of the Donaldson polynomial
invariants on compact K\"{a}hler surfaces. We also study an analogous theory on
compact oriented Riemann surfaces and briefly discuss a possible application of
the Witten's non-Abelian localization formula to the problems in the case of
compact K\"{a}hler surfaces.
