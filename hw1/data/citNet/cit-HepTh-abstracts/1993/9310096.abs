  We consider a generalization of the abelian Higgs model with a Chern-Simons
term by modifying two terms of the usual Lagrangian. We multiply a dielectric
function with the Maxwell kinetic energy term and incorporate nonminimal
interaction by considering generalized covariant derivative. We show that for a
particular choice of the dielectric function this model admits both topological
as well as nontopological charged vortices satisfying Bogomol'nyi bound for
which the magnetic flux, charge and angular momentum are not quantized. However
the energy for the topolgical vortices is quantized and in each sector these
topological vortex solutions are infinitely degenerate. In the nonrelativistic
limit, this model admits static self-dual soliton solutions with nonzero finite
energy configuration. For the whole class of dielectric function for which the
nontopological vortices exists in the relativistic theory, the charge density
satisfies the same Liouville equation in the nonrelativistic limit.
