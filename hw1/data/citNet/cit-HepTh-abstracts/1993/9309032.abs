  In the analytic-Bargmann representation associated with the harmonic
oscillator and spin coherent states, the wavefunction as entire complex
functions can be factorized in terms of their zeros in a unique way. The
Schr\"odinger equation of motion for the wavefunction is turned to a system of
equations for its zeros. The motion of these zeros as a non-linear flow of
points is studied and interpreted for linear and non-linear bosonic and spin
Hamiltonians. Attention is given to the study of the zeros of the
Jaynes-Cummings model and to its finite analoque. Numerical solutions are
derived and discussed.
