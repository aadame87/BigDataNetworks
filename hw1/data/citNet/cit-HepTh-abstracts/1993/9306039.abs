  The statistical mechanics of an anyon gas in a magnetic field is addressed.
An harmonic regulator is used to define a proper thermodynamic limit. When the
magnetic field is sufficiently strong, only exact $N$-anyon groundstates, where
anyons occupy the lowest Landau level, contribute to the equation of state.
Particular attention is paid to the interval of definition of the statistical
parameter $\alpha\in[-1,0]$ where a gap exists. Interestingly enough, one finds
that at the critical filling $\nu=-{1/\alpha}$ where the pressure diverges, the
external magnetic field is entirely screened by the flux tubes carried by the
anyons.
