  In the context of two-dimensional quantum cosmology, we consider the
path-integral of a string on annulus which contains the Liouville field and
conformal matter fields. We show that, in the transition amplitude of the
string universe, the non-zero modes of the fields are all cancelled out only
when we take the $c=1$ conformal matter field and impose the Neumann boundary
condition on the system. The transition amplitude obtained obeys the
minisuperspace Wheeler-DeWitt equation. In our treatment, the modular parameter
on annulus plays the role of time variable to integrate out.
