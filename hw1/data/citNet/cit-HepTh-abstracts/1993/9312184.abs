  Within four dimensional (4d) N=1 supergravity theories we present extreme
dilatonic domain wall solutions with a general overall coupling $\alpha$ in the
dilaton K\" ahler potential. We concentrate on extreme Type I walls, which are
static, planar configurations, interpolating between Minkowski space-time and a
new type of space-time with a varying dilaton field. $\alpha=0$ case yields
extreme ``ordinary'' supergravity walls between Minkowski and anti-de Sitter
space-times. For $\alpha=1$ the walls are extreme ``stringy dilatonic'' walls
of the three level superstring vacua interpolating between the constant and
linear dilaton vacuum. Extreme stringy dilatonic walls ($\alpha =1$) serve as a
dividing line between the walls ($0<\alpha<1$) with the (planar) singularity
covered by the horizon and those ($\alpha>1$) with the naked singularity.
Striking similarities between the global space-time structure of such domain
walls and and the one of the corresponding extreme charged black holes with a
general dilaton coupling are pointed out.
