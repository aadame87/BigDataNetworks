  In this paper we present a systematic study of $W$ algebras from the
Hamiltonian reduction point of view. The Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) reduction scheme
is generalized to arbitrary $sl_2$ embeddings thus showing that a large class
of W algebras can be viewed as reductions of affine Lie algebras. The
hierarchies of integrable evolution equations associated to these classical W
algebras are constructed as well as the generalized Toda field theories which
have them as Noether symmetry algebras. The problem of quantising the DS
reductions is solved for arbitrary $sl_2$ embeddings and it is shown that any W
algebra can be embedded into an affine Lie algebra. This also provides us with
an algorithmic method to write down free field realizations for arbitrary W
algebras. Just like affine Lie algebras W algebras have finite underlying
structures called `finite W algebras'. We study the classical and quantum
theory of these algebras, which play an important role in the theory of
ordinary W algebras, in detail as well as some aspects of their representation
theory. The symplectic leaves (or W-coadjoint orbits) associated to arbitrary
finite W algebras are determined as well as their realization in terms of
bosoic oscillators. Apart from these technical aspects we also review the
potential applications of W symmetry to string theory, 2-dimensional critical
phenomena, the quantum Hall effect and solitary wave phenomena. This work is
based on the Ph.D. thesis of the author.
