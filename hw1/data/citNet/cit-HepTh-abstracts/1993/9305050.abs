Title: The Integrable Mapping as the Discrete Group of Inner Symmetry of
  Integrable Systems
Authors: D.B. Fairlie and A.N. Leznov
Comments: 7, LaTeX, DTP/93/33
\\
  It is shown that each integrable mapping is connected with a hierarchical
completely integrable sytem of equations of evolution type which are invariant
with respect to the transformation described by this mapping.
