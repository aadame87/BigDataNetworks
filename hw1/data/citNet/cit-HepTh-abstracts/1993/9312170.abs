  We clarify the relation between the approach to $q$-Minkowski space of
Carow-Watamura et al. with an approach based on the idea of $2\times 2$ braided
Hermitean matrices. The latter are objects like super-matrices but with
Bose-Fermi statistics replaced by braid statistics. We also obtain new R-matrix
formulae for the $q$-Poincare group in this framework.
