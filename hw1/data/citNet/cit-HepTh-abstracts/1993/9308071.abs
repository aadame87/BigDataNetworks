  We give a unified view of the relation between the $SL(2)$ KdV, the mKdV, and
the Ur-KdV equations through the Fr\'{e}chet derivatives and their inverses.
For this we introduce a new procedure of obtaining the Ur-KdV equation, where
we require that it has no non-local operators. We extend this method to the
$SL(3)$ KdV equation, i.e., Boussinesq(Bsq) equation and obtain the hamiltonian
structure of Ur-Bsq equationin a simple form. In particular, we explicitly
construct the hamiltonian operator of the Ur-Bsq system which defines the
poisson structure of the system, through the Fr\'{e}chet derivative and its
inverse.
