  We consider here the Chern-Simons field theory with gauge group SU(N) in the
presence of a gravitational background that describes a two-dimensional
expanding ``universe". Two special cases are treated here in detail: the
spatially flat {\it Robertson-Walker} space-time and the conformally static
space-times having a general closed and orientable Riemann surface as spatial
section. The propagator and the vertices are explicitely computed at the lowest
order in perturbation theory imposing the Coulomb gauge fixing.
