  We show that, in string theory, as a result of the $W_{\infty}$-symmetries
that preserve quantum coherence in the {\it full} string theory by coupling
different mass levels, transitions between initial- and final-state density
matrices for the effective light-particle theory involve non-Hamiltonian terms
$\nd{\delta H}$ in their time evolution, and are described by a $\nd{S}$ matrix
that is not factorizable as a product of field-theoretical $S$ and $S^\dagger$
matrices. We exhibit non-trivial string contributions to $\nd{\delta H}$ and
the $\nd{S}$ matrix associated with topological fluctuations related to the
coset model that describes an s-wave black hole. These include
monopole-antimonopole configurations on the world-sheet that correspond to
black hole creation and annihilation, and instantons that represent
back-reaction via quantum jumps between black holes of different mass, both of
which make the string supercritical. The resulting Liouville mode is
interpreted as the time variable, and the arrow of time is associated with
black hole decay. Since conformal invariance is broken in the non-critical
string theory, monopole and antimonopole, or instanton and anti-instanton, are
not separable, and the
