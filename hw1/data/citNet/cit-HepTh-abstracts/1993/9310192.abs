  A study of the superconformal covariantization of superdifferential operators
defined on $(1|1)$ superspace is presented. It is shown that a
superdifferential operator with a particular type of constraint can be
covariantized only when it is of odd order. In such a case, the action of
superconformal transformation on the superdifferential operator is nothing but
a hamiltonian flow defined by the corresponding supersymmetric second
Gelfand-Dickey bracket. The covariant form of a superdifferential operator of
odd order is given.
