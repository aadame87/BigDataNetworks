  We study the evolution of cosmic strings taking into account the frictional
force due to the surrounding radiation. We consider small perturbations on
straight strings, oscillation of circular loops and small perturbations on
circular loops. For straight strings, friction exponentially suppresses
perturbations whose co-moving scale crosses the horizon before cosmological
time $t_*\sim \mu^{-2}$ (in Planck units), where $\mu$ is the string tension.
Loops with size much smaller than $t_*$ will be approximately circular at the
time when they start the relativistic collapse. We investigate the possibility
that such loops will form black holes. We find that the number of black holes
which are formed through this process is well bellow present observational
limits, so this does not give any lower or upper bounds on $\mu$. We also
consider the case of straight strings attached to walls and circular holes that
can spontaneously nucleate on metastable domain walls.
