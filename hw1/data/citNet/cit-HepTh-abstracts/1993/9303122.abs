  In two recent papers, a new method was developed for calculating
ten-dimensional superstring amplitudes with an arbitrary number of loops and
external massless particles, and for expressing them in manifestly
Lorentz-invariant form. By explicitly checking for divergences when the Riemann
surface degenerates, these amplitudes are proven to be finite. By choosing
light-cone moduli for the surface and comparing with the light-cone
Green-Schwarz formalism, these amplitudes are proven to be unitary.
