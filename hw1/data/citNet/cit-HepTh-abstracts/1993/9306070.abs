  We apply CGHS-type dilaton gravity model to (1+1)-dimensional cosmological
situations.
  First the behavior of a compact 1-dimensional universe (i.e. like a closed
string) is classified on the assumption of homogeneity of universe.
  Several interesting solutions are found, which include a Misner-type universe
having closed time-like curves, and an asymptotically de Sitter universe first
pointed out by Yoshimura.
  In the second half of this talk, we discuss the modification of the classical
homogeneous solutions, considering inhomogeneity of classical conformal matters
and also quantum back-reaction respectively.
