  In a previous paper we have shown how, for bosonic fields, the generating
functional in both relativistic quantum field theory and thermal field theory
can be evaluated by use of a standard quantum mechanical path integral. In this
paper we extend this method to include fermionic fields. A particular problem
is posed by Green's functions with external fermionic lines, where the
different boundary conditions of bosons and fermions in imaginary time have to
be accommodated within one path integral expression. The general procedure is
worked out in the example of scalar and spinor self-energies in a simple model
with a Yukawa coupling of a scalar to a Majorana spinor.
