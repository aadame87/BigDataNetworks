  It is shown that gravity on the line can be described by the two dimensional
(2D) Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian supplemented by a kinetic term for the coframe
and a translational {\it boundary} term. The resulting model is equivalent to a
Yang-Mills theory of local {\it translations} and frozen Lorentz gauge degrees.
We will show that this restricted Poincar\'e gauge model in 2 dimensions is
completely integrable. {\it Exact} wave, charged black hole, and `dilaton'
solutions are then readily found. In vacuum, the integrability of the {\it
general} 2D Poincar\'e gauge theory is formally proved along the same line of
reasoning.
