  We describe the harmonic superspace formulation of the Witten-Manin
supertwistor correspondence for N=3 extended super Yang-Mills theories. The
essence is that on being sufficiently supersymmetrised (up to the N=3
extension), the Yang-Mills equations of motion can be recast in the form of
Cauchy-Riemann-like holomorphicity conditions for a pair of prepotentials in
the appropriate harmonic superspace. This formulation makes the explicit
construction of solutions a rather more tractable proposition than previous
attempts.
