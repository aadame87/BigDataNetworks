\\
  Quantum de Rham complexes on the quantum plane and the quantum group itself
are constructed for the Zakrewski deformation of $ Fun ( SL(2)) $. As a
by-product a new deformation of the two dimensional Heisenberg algeb ra is
constructed which can be used to construct models of h-deformed quantum
mechanics.
