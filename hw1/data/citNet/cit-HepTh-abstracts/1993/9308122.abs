  Mirror Symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations and instanton corrected Yukawa
couplings are discussed within the framework of toric geometry. It allows to
establish mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau spaces for which the mirror manifold
had been unavailable in previous constructions. Mirror maps and Yukawa
couplings are explicitly given for several examples with two and three moduli.
