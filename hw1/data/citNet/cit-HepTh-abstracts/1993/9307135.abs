Title: The Wigner-Weyl formalism and the semi-classical relativistic
  approximation
Authors: J. Mourad
Comments: 6 pages
\\
  The relativistic semi-classical approximation for a free massive particle is
studied using the Wigner-Weyl formalism. A non-covariant Wigner function is
proposed using the Newton-Wigner position operator. The perturbative solution
for the time evolution is found. Causality is found to be perturbatively
respected.
