  We examine the evaporation of two--dimensional black holes, the classical
space--times of which are extended geometries, like for example the
two--dimensional section of the extremal Reissner--Nordstrom black hole. We
find that the evaporation in two particular models proceeds to a stable
end--point. This should represent the generic behavior of a certain class of
two--dimensional dilaton--gravity models. There are two distinct regimes
depending on whether the back--reaction is weak or strong in a certain sense.
When the back--reaction is weak, evaporation proceeds via an adiabatic
evolution, whereas for strong back--reaction, the decay proceeds in a somewhat
surprising manner. Although information loss is inevitable in these models at
the semi--classical level, it is rather benign, in that the information is
stored in another asymptotic region.
