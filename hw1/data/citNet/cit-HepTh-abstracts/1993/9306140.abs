  The finite form of the $N=2$ super-Weyl transformations in the chiral and
twisted-chiral irreducible formulations of the two-dimensional $N=2$ superfield
supergravity are found in $N=2$ superspace. The super-Weyl anomaly of the $N=2$
extended fermionic string theory is computed in terms of the $N=2$ superfields,
by using a short time expansion of the $N=2$ chiral heat kernel. The super-Weyl
invariant $N=2$ superconformal structure is introduced, and a new definition of
the $N=2$ super-Riemannian surfaces is proposed.
