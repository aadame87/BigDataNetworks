  In the framework of communication theory, we analyse the gedanken experiment
in which beams of quanta bearing information are flashed towards a black hole.
We show that stimulated emission at the horizon provides a correlation between
incoming and outgoing radiations consisting of bosons. For fermions, the
mechanism responsible for the correlation is the Fermi exclusion principle.
Each one of these mechanisms is responsible for the a partial transfer of the
information originally coded in the incoming beam to the black--hole radiation.
We show that this process is very efficient whenever stimulated emission
overpowers spontaneous emission (bosons). Thus, black holes are not `ultimate
waste baskets of information'.
