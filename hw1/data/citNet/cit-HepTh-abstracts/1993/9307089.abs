  The existence of the invariant measure in nonlocal regularized actions is
discussed. It is shown that the measure for nonlocally regularized QED, as
presented in\cite{Moff-Wood}, exists to all orders, and is precisely what is
required to maintain gauge invariance at one loop and guarantees perturbative
unitarity. We also demonstrate how the given procedure breaks down in anomalous
theories, and discuss its generalization to other actions.
