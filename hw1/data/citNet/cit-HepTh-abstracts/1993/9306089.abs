  The general solutions for the factorization equations of the reflection
matrices $K^{\pm}(\theta)$ for the eight vertex and six vertex models (XYZ, XXZ
and XXX chains) are found. The associated integrable magnetic Hamiltonians are
explicitly derived, finding families dependig on several continuous as well as
discrete parameters.
