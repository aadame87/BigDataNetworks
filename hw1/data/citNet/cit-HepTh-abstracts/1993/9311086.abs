  We derive the loop equations for the d-dimensional n-Hermitian matrix model.
These are a consequence of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the model. Moreover
we show that in leading order of large $N$ the loop equations form a closed
set. In particular we derive the loop equations for the $n=2^k$ matrix model
recently proposed to describe the coupling of Two-dimensional quantum gravity
to conformal matter with $c> 1$.
