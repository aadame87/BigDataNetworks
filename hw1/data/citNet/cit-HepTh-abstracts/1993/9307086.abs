  Chiral lagrangians describing the interactions of Goldstone bosons in a
theory possessing spontaneous symmetry breaking are effective,
non-renormalizable field theories in four dimensions. Yet, in a momentum
expansion one is able to extract definite, testable predictions from
perturbation theory. These techniques have yielded in recent years a wealth of
information on many problems where the physics of Goldstone bosons plays a
crucial role, but theoretical issues concerning chiral perturbation theory
remain, to this date, poorly treated in the literature. We present here a
rather comprehensive analysis of the regularization and renormalization
ambiguities appearing in chiral perturbation theory at the one loop level. We
discuss first on the relevance of dealing with tadpoles properly. We
demonstrate that Ward identities severely constrain the choice of regulators to
the point of enforcing unique, unambiguous results in chiral perturbation
theory at the one-loop level for any observable which is renormalization-group
invariant. We comment on the physical implications of these results and on
several possible regulating methods that may be of use for some applications.
