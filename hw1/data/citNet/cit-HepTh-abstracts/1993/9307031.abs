  We prove a generalization of the Verlinde formula to fermionic rational
conformal field theories. The fusion coefficients of the fermionic theory are
equal to sums of fusion coefficients of its bosonic projection. In particular,
fusion coefficients of the fermionic theory connecting two conjugate Ramond
fields with the identity are either one or two. Therefore, one is forced to
weaken the axioms of fusion algebras for fermionic theories. We show that in
the special case of fermionic W(2,d)-algebras these coefficients are given by
the dimensions of the irreducible representations of the horizontal subalgebra
on the highest weight. As concrete examples we discuss fusion algebras of
rational models of fermionic W(2,d)-algebras including minimal models of the
$N=1$ super Virasoro algebra as well as $N=1$ super W-algebras SW(3/2,d).
