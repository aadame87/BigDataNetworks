  Recently derived general formal solutions of a BRST quantization on inner
product spaces of irreducible Lie group gauge theories are applied to trivial
models and relativistic particle models for particles with spin 0, 1/2 and 1.
In the process general quantization rules are discovered which make the formal
solutions exact. The treatment also give evidence that the formal solutions are
directly generalizable to theories with graded gauge symmetries. For
relativistic particles reasonable results are obtained although there exists no
completely Lorentz covariant quantization of the coordinate and momenta on
inner product spaces. There are two inequivalent procedures depending on
whether or not the time coordinate is quantized with positive or indefinite
metric states. The latter is connected to propagators.
