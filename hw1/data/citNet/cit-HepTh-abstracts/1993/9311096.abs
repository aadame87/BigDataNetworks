  We show that the external algebra $\cal M$ on $GL(N)$ can be equipped with
the graded Poisson brackets compatible with the group action. We prove that
there are only two graded Poisson-Lie structures (brackets) on $\cal M$ and we
obtain their explicit description. We realize that just these two structures
appear as the quasiclassical limit of the bicovariant differential calculi on
the quantum linear group $GL_q (N)$.
