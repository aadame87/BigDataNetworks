  We define new quantizations of the Heisenberg group by introducing new
quantizations in the universal enveloping algebra of its Lie algebra. Matrix
coefficients of the Stone--von Neumann representation are preserved by these
new multiplications on the algebra of functions on the Heisenberg group. Some
of the new quantizations provide also a new multiplication in the algebra of
theta functions; we obtain in this way Sklyanin algebras.
