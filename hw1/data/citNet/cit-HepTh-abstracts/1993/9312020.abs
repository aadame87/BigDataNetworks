  Using a formalism of minitwistors, we derive infinitely many conserved
charges for the $sl(\infty )$-Toda equation which accounts for gravitational
instantons with a rotational Killing symmetry. These charges are shown to form
an infinite dimensional algebra through the Poisson bracket which is isomorphic
to two dimensional area preserving diffeomorphism with central extentions.
