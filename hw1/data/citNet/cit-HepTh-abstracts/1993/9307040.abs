  Witten recently gave further evidence for the conjectured relationship
between the $A$ series of the $N=2$ minimal models and certain Landau-Ginzburg
models by computing the elliptic genus for the latter. The results agree with
those of the $N=2$ minimal models, as can be calculated from the known
characters of the discrete series representations of the $N=2$ superconformal
algebra. The $N=2$ minimal models also have a Lagrangian representation as
supersymmetric gauged WZW models. We calculate the elliptic genera, interpreted
as a genus one path integral with twisted boundary conditions, for such models
and recover the previously known result.
