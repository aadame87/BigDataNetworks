  We study on-shell and off-shell properties of the supersymmetric sinh-Gordon
and perturbed SUSY Yang-Lee models using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and
form factors. Identifying the supersymmetric models with the Eight Vertex Free
Fermion Model, we derive inversion relation for inhomogeneous transfer matrix
and TBA equations and get correct UV results. We obtain two-point form factors
of the trace of energy-momentum tensor using the Watson equations and their
SUSY transformations. As an application, we compute the UV central charge using
these form factors and spectral representation of the $C$-theorem.
