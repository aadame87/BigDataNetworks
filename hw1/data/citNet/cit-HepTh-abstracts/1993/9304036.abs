  After reviewing the role of phase in quantum mechanics, I discuss, with the
aid of a number of unpublished documents, the development of quantum phase
operators in the 1960's. Interwoven in the discussion are the critical physics
questions of the field: Are there (unique) quantum phase operators and are
there quantum systems which can determine their nature? I conclude with a
critique of recent proposals which have shed new light on the problem.
