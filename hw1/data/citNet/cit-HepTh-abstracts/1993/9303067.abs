  A recent proposal for a background independent open string field theory is
studied in detail for a class of backgrounds that correspond to general
quadratic boundary interactions on the world-sheet. A short-distance cut-off is
introduced to formulate the theory with a finite number of local and
potentially unrenormalizable boundary couplings. It is shown that
renormalization of the boundary couplings makes both the world-sheet partition
function and the string field action finite and cut-off independent, although
the resulting string field action has an unpalatable dependence on the leading
unrenormalizable coupling.
