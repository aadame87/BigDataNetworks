Title: The WZNW model by a perturbation of Witten's conformal solution
Authors: Oleg A. Soloviev
Comments: 5 pages, LaTex file, QMW-93-25. (The value of the second conformal
  point of the perturbed WZNW model is presented. Please note that a title is
  changed.)
\\
  The WZNW model at the Witten conformal point is perturbed by the sigma model
term. It is shown that in the large level k limit the perturbed WZNW system
with negative k arrives at the WZNW model with positive k.
