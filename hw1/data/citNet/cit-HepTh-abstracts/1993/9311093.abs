  We formulate WZW models based on a centrally extended version of the
Euclidean group in $d$-dimensions. We obtain string backgrounds corresponding
to conformal $\s$-models in $D=d^2$ space-time dimensions with exact central
charge $c=d^2$ and $d(d-1)/2$ null Killing vectors. By identifying the
corresponding conformal field theory we show that the one loop results coincide
with the exact ones up to a shifting of a parameter.
