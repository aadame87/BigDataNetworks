  We present a grapical way to describe invariants and covariants in the (4
dim) general relativity. This makes us free from the complexity of suffixes .
Two new off-shell relations between (mass)$\ast\ast 6$\ invariants are
obtained. These are important for 2-loop off-shell calculation in the
perturbative quantum gravity. We list up all independent invarians with
dimensions of (mass)$\ast\ast 4$\ and (mass)$\ast\ast 6$. Furthermore the
explicit form of 6 dim Gauss-Bonnet identity is obtained.
