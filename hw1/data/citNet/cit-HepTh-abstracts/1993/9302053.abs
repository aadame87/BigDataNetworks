Title: Classification of Solvable Feynman Path Integrals
Authors: Christian Grosche and Frank Steiner
Comments: 13 pages, amstex, preprint DESY 92--189, and SISSA/1/93/FM
\\
  A systematic classification of Feynman path integrals in quantum mechanics is
presented and a table of solvable path integrals is given which reflects the
progress made during the last ten years or so, including, of course, the main
contributions since the invention of the path integral by Feynman in 1942. An
outline of the general theory is given. Explicit formul\ae\ for the so-called
basic path integrals are presented on which our general scheme to classify and
calculate path integrals in quantum mechanics is based.
