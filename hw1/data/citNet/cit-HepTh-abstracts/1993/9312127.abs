Title: Black Hole Evaporation along Macroscopic Strings
Authors: A. Lawrence and E. Martinec
Comments: 26pp, EFI 93-73. (Original claim that string Hawking flux exceeds
  spacetime flux is WRONG. It is the same; revised version provides correct
  argument and additional comments.)

  We develop the quantization of a macroscopic string which extends radially
from a Schwarzschild black hole. The Hawking process excites a thermal bath of
string modes that causes the black hole to lose mass. The resulting typical
string configuration is a random walk in the angular coordinates. We show that
the energy flux in string excitations is approximately that of spacetime field
modes.
