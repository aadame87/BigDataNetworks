Title: The Wave Function of a Collapsing Star and Quantization Conditions
Authors: Yoav Peleg
Comments: 13 pages, BRX-TH-342
\\
  A very simple minisuperspace describing the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapsing
star is found. The semiclasical wave function of that model turn out to
describe a bound state. For fixed initial radius of the collapsing star, the
corrssponding Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition implies mass quantization.
An extension of this model, and some consequences, are considered.
