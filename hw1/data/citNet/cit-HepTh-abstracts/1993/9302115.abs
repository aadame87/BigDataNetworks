  RSOS models based on the Lie algebras $B_m$, $C_m$ and $D_m$ are derived from
the braiding of conformal field theory. This gives the first systematic
derivation of these models earlier described by Jimbo et al. The general two
field Boltzmann weights associated to any RCFT are described, giving in
particular the off critical thermalized Boltzmann weights. Crossing properties
are discussed and are shown to agree with the general theory which connects
these with toroidal modular transformations. The soliton systems based on these
lattice models are described and are conjectured based on the mass formulae and
the spins of the integrals of motions to describe perturbations of the RCFT
$G_k\times G_1\over G_{k+1}$, where $G$ is the corresponding Lie algebra.
