  We propose a new type of gauge in two-dimensional quantum gravity. We
investigate pure gravity in this gauge, and find that the system reduces to
quantum mechanics of loop length $l$. Furthermore, we rederive the $c\!=\!0$
string field theory which was discovered recently. In particular, the
pregeometric form of the Hamiltonian is naturally reproduced.
