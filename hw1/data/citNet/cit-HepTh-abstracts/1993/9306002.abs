  We study integrals of motion and factorizable S-matrices in two-dimensional
integrable field theory with boundary. We propose the ``boundary
cross-unitarity equation'' which is the boundary analog of the cross-symmetry
condition of the ``bulk'' S-matrix. We derive the boundary S-matrices for the
Ising field theory with boundary magnetic field and for the boundary
sine-Gordon model.
