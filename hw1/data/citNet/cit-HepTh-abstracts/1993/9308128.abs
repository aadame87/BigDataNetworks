Title: A Ten-Dimensional Super-Yang-Mills Action with Off-Shell Supersymmetry
Authors: Nathan Berkovits
Comments: 6 pages plain Tex, KCL-TH-93-11 (a clarifying comment is made
  concerning the statistics of the supersymmetry transformation)
Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B318 (1993) 104-106
\\
  After adding seven auxiliary scalar fields, the action for ten-dimensional
super-Yang-Mills contains an equal number of bosonic and fermionic non-gauge
fields. Besides being manifestly Lorentz and gauge-invariant, this action
contains nine spacetime supersymmetries whose algebra closes off-shell.
Octonions provide a convenient notation for displaying these symmetries.
