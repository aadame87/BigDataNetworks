  The electric charge of a wormhole mouth and the magnetic flux ``linked'' by
the wormhole are non-commuting observables, and so cannot be simultaneously
diagonalized. We use this observation to resolve some puzzles in wormhole
electrodynamics and chromodynamics. Specifically, we analyze the color electric
field that results when a colored object traverses a wormhole, and we discuss
the measurement of the wormhole charge and flux using Aharonov-Bohm
interference effects. We suggest that wormhole mouths may obey conventional
quantum statistics, contrary to a recent proposal by Strominger.
