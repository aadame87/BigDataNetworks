Title: (J,0)+(0,j) Representation Space: Majorana-Like Construct
Authors: D. V. Ahluwalia, T. Goldman, and M. B. Johnson

  This is second of the two invited lectures presented (by D. V. Ahluwalia) at
the ``XVII International School of Theoretical Physics: Standard Model and
Beyond' 93.'' The text is essentially based on a recent publication by the
present authors [Mod. Phys. Lett. A (in press)]. Here, after briefly reviewing
the $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ Dirac-like construct in the front form, we present a
detailed construction of the $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ Majorana-like fields.
