Title: Axion-Dilaton Black Holes
Authors: Renata Kallosh
Comments: 8 pages, LATEX, (Talk presented at the TEXAS/PASCOS conference,
  Berkeley, December 1992)

  In this talk some essential features of stringy black holes are described. We
consider charged four-dimensional axion-dilaton black holes. The Hawking
temperature and the entropy of all solutions are shown to be simple functions
of the squares of supercharges, defining the positivity bounds. Spherically
symmetric and multi black hole solutions are presented. The extreme solutions
have some unbroken supersymmetries. Axion-dilaton black holes with zero entropy
and zero area of the horizon form a family of stable particle-like objects,
which we call holons. We discuss the possibility of splitting of nearly extreme
black holes into holons.
