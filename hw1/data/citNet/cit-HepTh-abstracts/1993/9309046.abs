  Theories

  We present the static, spherically symmetric solutions of the low energy $d =
4$ string. They form a simple generalisation of the Schwarzschild solution and
describe the gravitational field of a spherical star in perturbative string
theory. If the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ is different from one, these
solutions describe singular objects with naked singularities at their horizons,
and whose Hawking temperature is infinite. These objects might represent
``massive remnants'', the end states of black holes. Our analysis also implies
that Brans-Dicke theory has a naked singularity. Invoking cosmic censorship
conjecture will rule out Brans-Dicke theory.
