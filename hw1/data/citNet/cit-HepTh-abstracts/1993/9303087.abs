  The present paper is revised copy of hep-th/9303087 in which higher spin
extensions of the nonabelian gauge symmetries for the classical WZNW model are
considered. Both linear and nonlinear realizations of the extended affine
Kac-Moody algebra are obtained. A characteristic property of the WZNW model is
that it admits a higher spin linear realization of the extended affine
Kac-Moody algebra which is equivalent to the corresponding higher spin
nonlinear realization of the same algebra. However, in both cases the higher
spin currents do not form an invariant space with respect to their generating
transformations. This makes it imposible for this symmetry to be gauged.
