Title: Wave Functional of Quantum Black Holes in Two Dimensions
Authors: Takayuki Hori and Masaru Kamata
Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, TEP-10
\\
  The wheeler-DeWitt method is applied to the quantization of the 1 + 1
dimensional dilaton gravity coupled with the conformal matter fields. Exact
solutions to the WD equations are found, which are interpreted as
right(left)-moving black holes.
