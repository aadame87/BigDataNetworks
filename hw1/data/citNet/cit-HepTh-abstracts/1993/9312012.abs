  The effective formulas reducing the two-dimensional Hermite polynomials to
the classical (one-dimensional) orthogonal polynomials are given. New
one-parameter generating functions for these polynomials are derived.
Asymptotical formulas for large values of indices are found. The applications
to the squeezed one-mode states and to the time-dependent quantum harmonic
oscillator are considered.
