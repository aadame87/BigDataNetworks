  The Chern-Simons membranes and in general the Chern-Simons p-branes moving in
$D$-dimensional target space admit an infinite set of secondary constraints.
With respect to the Poisson bracket these constraints form a closed algebra
which contains classical \ $W_{1+\infty }$ \ algebra in $p$-dimensions as a
subalgebra. Corresponding gauged theory in the phase-space is constructed in a
Hamilton gauge as an analog of the ordinary $W$-gravity.
