  In a four dimensional theory of gravity with lagrangian quadratic in
curvature and torsion, we compute the effective action for metrics of the form
$g_{\mu\nu}=\rho^2\delta_{\mu\nu}$, with $\rho$ constant. Using standard
field-theoretic methods we find that one loop quantum effects produce a
nontrivial effective potential for $\rho$. We explain this unexpected result by
showing how our regularization procedure differs from the one that is usually
adopted in Quantum Gravity. Using the method of the average effective
potential, we compute the scale dependence of the v.e.v. of the conformal
factor.
