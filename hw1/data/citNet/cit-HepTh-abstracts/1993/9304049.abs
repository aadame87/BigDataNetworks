  We study the nonunitary representations of N=2 Super Virasoro algebra for the
rational central charges c<3. The resolutions for the irreducible
representations of N=2 SVir in terms of the "2-d gravity modules" are obtained
and their characters are computed. The correspondence between the N=2
nonunitary "minimal" models and the Virasoro minimal models coupled to 2-d
gravity is shown at the level of states. We also define the hamiltonian
reduction of the BRST complex of sl(N)/sl(N) coset to the BRST complex of the
W-gravity coupled to the W matter. The case of sl(2) is considered explicitly.
It leads to the presentation of N=2 Super Virasoro algebra by the Lie algebra
cohomology. Finally, we reveal the mechanism of the correspondence between
sl(2)/sl(2)$ coset and 2-d gravity.
