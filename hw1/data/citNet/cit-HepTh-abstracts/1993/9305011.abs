  We calculate perturbatively the pressure of a dilute gas of anyons through
second order in the anyon coupling constant, as described by Chern-Simons field
theory. Near Bose statistics , the divergences in the perturbative expansion
are exactly cancelled by a two-body $\delta$-function potential which is not
required near Fermi statistics. To the order considered, we find no need for a
non-hermitian Hamiltonian. (This paper precedes the article ''Three loop
calculation of the full anyonic partition function'', by R. Emparan and M.
