  The sigma model action described in this paper differs in four important
features from the usual sigma model action for the four-dimensional
Green-Schwarz heterotic superstring in a massless background. Firstly, the
action is constructed on an N=(2,0) super-worldsheet using a Kahler potential
and an Ogievetsky-Sokatchev constraint; secondly, the target-space background
fields are unconstrained; thirdly, the target-space dilaton couples to the
two-dimensional curvature; and fourthly, the action reduces in a flat
background to a free-field action. A conjecture is made for generalizing this
N=(2,0) sigma model action to the ten-dimensional Green-Schwarz heterotic
superstring in a manner that preserves these four new features.
