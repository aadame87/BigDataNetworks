  In this paper we develop the covariant string field theory approach to open
2d strings. Upon constructing the vertices, we apply the formalism to calculate
the lowest order contributions to the 4- and 5- point tachyon--tachyon tree
amplitudes. Our results are shown to match the `bulk' amplitude calculations of
Bershadsky and Kutasov. In the present approach the pole structure of the
amplitudes becomes manifest and their origin as coming from the higher string
modes transparent.
