  We consider (1+1)-dimensional QCD coupled to scalars in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group SU($N$). This model results from dimensional
reduction of the (2+1)-dimensional pure glue theory. In the large-$N$ limit we
study the spectrum of glueballs numerically, using the discretized \lcq. We
find a discrete spectrum of bound states, with the density of levels growing
approximately exponentially with the mass. A few low-lying states are very
close to being eigenstates of the parton number, and their masses can be
accurately calculated by truncated diagonalizations.
