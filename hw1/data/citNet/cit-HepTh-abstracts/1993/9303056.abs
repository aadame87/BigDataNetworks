Title: Symmetry and Observables in Induced QCD
Authors: Gordon W. Semenoff and Nathan Weiss

  We review some of the basic features of the Kazakov-Migdal model of induced
QCD. We emphasize the role of $Z_N$ symmetry in determining the observable
properties of the model and also argue that it can be broken explicitly without
ruining the solvability of induced QCD in the infinite $N$ limit. We outline
the sort of critical behavior which the master field must have in order that
the model is still solvable. We also review some aspects of the $D=1$ version
of the model where the partition function can be obtained analytically. To be
published in the Proceedings of "Mathematical Physics, String Theory and
Quantum Gravity", Rhakov, Ukraine. October, 1992
