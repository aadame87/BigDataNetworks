  T-Duality invariant worldsheet string actions, recently written down by
Schwarz and Sen, are coupled to the worldsheet gauge fields. It is shown that
the integration of the dual coordinates gives the conventional, vector, axial
and chiral, gauged string actions for the appropriate choice of the gauged
isometries. Alternatively, the gauge field integration is shown to give a
T-duality invariant action which matches with the corresponding results known
earlier.
