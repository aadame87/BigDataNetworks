Title: Review of free-fermionic 4d string models
Authors: I. Antoniadis
Comments: 12 pages, CPTH-C256.0693 (Based on talks presented at the SUSY-93
  International Workshop, Boston, March 29 - April 1, 1993, and at the XVI
  Kazimierz Meeting on Elementary Particle Physics, Kazimierz, Poland, 24-28
  May 1993)

  I review the main properties of four-dimensional strings constructed with
free-fermions on the world-sheet. In particular I discuss possible model
independent low energy predictions related to the existence of states with
fractional electric charges, the computation of the string unification scale,
the string model building, and the perturbative approach to supersymmetry
breaking which makes the spectacular prediction of a new large dimension at the
TeV scale.
