  We show that integrable vertex and RSOS models with trigonometric Boltzmann
weights and appropriate inhomogeneities provide a convenient lattice
regularization for massive field theories and for the recently studied massless
field theories that interpolate between two non trivial conformal field
theories. Massive and massless S matrices are computed from the lattice Bethe
ansatz.
