  The true variables in QED are the transverse photon components and Dirac's
physical electron, constructed out of the fermionic field and the longitudinal
components of the photon. We calculate the propagators in terms of these
variables to one loop and demonstrate their gauge invariance. The physical
electron propagator is shown not to suffer from infrared divergences in any
gauge. In general, all physical Green's functions are gauge invariant and
infrared-finite.
