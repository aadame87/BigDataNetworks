  We derive an explicit, exactly conformally invariant form for the action for
the non-abelian Toda field theory. We demonstrate that the conformal invariance
conditions, expressed in terms of the $\beta$-functions of the theory, are
satisfied to all orders, and we use our results to obtain a value for the
central charge agreeing with previous calculations.
