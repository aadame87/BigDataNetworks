  The renormalization group method is employed to study the effective potential
in curved spacetime with torsion. The renormalization-group improved effective
potential corresponding to a massless gauge theory in such a spacetime is found
and in this way a generalization of Coleman-Weinberg's approach corresponding
to flat space is obtained. A method which works with the renormalization group
equation for two-loop effective potential calculations in torsionful spacetime
is developed. The effective potential for the conformal factor in the conformal
dynamics of quantum gravity with torsion is thereby calculated explicitly.
Finally, torsion-induced phase transitions are discussed.
