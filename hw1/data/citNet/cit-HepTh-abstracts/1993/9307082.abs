\\
  By dimensional reduction, Einstein-Hermitian equations of n + 1 dimensional
closed Kahler manifolds lead to vortex equations of n dimensional closed Kahler
manifolds. A Yang-Mills-Higgs functional to unitary bundles over closed Kahler
manifolds has topological invariance by adding the additional terms which have
ghost fields.
  Henceforth we achieve the matter (Higgs field) coupled topological field
theories in higher dimension.
