Title: A Few Projects in String Theory
Authors: A.M. Polyakov
Comments: 18 pages, latex (references added)
Report-no: PUPT-1394
\\
  In these lectures I discuss various unsolved problems of string theory and
their relations to quantum gravity, 3d Ising model, large N QCD, and quantum
cosmology. No solutions are presented but some new and perhaps useful
approaches are suggested.
