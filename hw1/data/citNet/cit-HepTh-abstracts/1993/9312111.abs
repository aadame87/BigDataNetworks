  Recent work on the relation between a special class of K\"ahler manifolds
with positive first Chern class and critical N$=$2 string vacua with c$=$9 is
reviewed and extended. (Based on a talk presented at the International Workshop
on
  Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental Interactions
  (SUSY 93), Boston, MA, March 1993)
