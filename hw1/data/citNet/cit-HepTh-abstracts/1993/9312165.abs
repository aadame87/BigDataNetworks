Title: Current commutator anomalies in finite-element quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Dean F. Miller
Comments: 15, OKHEP-93-10
\\
  Four-dimensional quantum electrodynamics has been formulated on a hypercubic
Minkowski finite-element lattice. The equations of motion have been derived so
as to preserve lattice gauge invariance and have been shown to be unitary. In
addition, species doubling is avoided due to the nonlocality of the
interactions. The model is used to investigate the lattice current algebra.
Regularization of the current is shown to arise in a natural and nonarbitrary
way. The commutators of the lattice current are calculated and shown to have
the expected qualitative behavior. These lattice results are compared to
various continuum calculations. (Five figures available from author.)
