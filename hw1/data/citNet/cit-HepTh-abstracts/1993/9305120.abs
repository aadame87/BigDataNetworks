  In these lecture notes we explain a connection between Yang-Mills theory on
arbitrary Riemann surfaces and two types of topological field theory, the so
called $BF$ and cohomological theories. The quantum Yang-Mills theory is solved
exactly using path integral techniques. Explicit expressions, in terms of group
representation theory, are obtained for the partition function and various
correlation functions. In a particular limit the Yang-Mills theory devolves to
the topological models and the previously determined correlation functions give
topological information about the moduli spaces of flat connections. In
particular, the partition function yields the volume of the moduli space for
which an explicit expression is derived. These notes are self contained, with a
basic introduction to the various ideas underlying the topological field
theories. This includes some relatively new work on handling problems that
arise in the presence of reducible connections which in turn forms the bridge
between the various models under consideration. These notes are identical to
those made available to participants of the 1992 summer school in Trieste,
except for one or two additions added circa January 1993.
