  We consider 3-point and 4-point correlation functions in a conformal field
theory with a W-algebra symmetry. Whereas in a theory with only Virasoro
symmetry the three point functions of descendants fields are uniquely
determined by the three point function of the corresponding primary fields this
is not the case for a theory with $W_3$ algebra symmetry. The generic 3-point
functions of W-descendant fields have a countable degree of arbitrariness. We
find, however, that if one of the fields belongs to a representation with null
states that this has implications for the 3-point functions. In particular if
one of the representations is doubly-degenerate then the 3-point function is
determined up to an overall constant. We extend our analysis to 4-point
functions and find that if two of the W-primary fields are doubly degenerate
then the intermediate channels are limited to a finite set and that the
corresponding chiral blocks are determined up to an overall constant. This
corresponds to the existence of a linear differential equation for the chiral
blocks with two completely degenerate fields as has been found in the work of
Bajnok~et~al.
