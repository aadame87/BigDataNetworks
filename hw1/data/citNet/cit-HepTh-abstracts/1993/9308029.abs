  We propose a ladder-operator method for obtaining the squeezed states of
general symmetry systems. It is a generalization of the annihilation-operator
technique for obtaining the coherent states of symmetry systems. We connect
this method with the minimum-uncertainty method for obtaining the squeezed and
coherent states of general potential systems, and comment on the distinctions
between these two methods and the displacement-operator method.
