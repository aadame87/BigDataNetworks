Title: Recent Developments in Fractional Superstrings
Authors: Keith R. Dienes
Comments: 11 pages (LaTeX) [Talk presented at the SUSY-93 Conference
  (Northeastern University) and at the MRST-15 "Walifest" Meeting (Syracuse
  University). This is a condensed summary of material presented in

  Fractional superstrings experience new types of ``internal projections''
which alter or deform their underlying worldsheet conformal field theories.
In this talk I summarize some recent results concerning both the worldsheet
theory which remains after the internal projections have acted, and the
spacetime statistics properties of its various sectors.
