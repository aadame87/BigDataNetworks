  A higher dimensional analogue of the KP hierarchy is presented. Fundamental
constituents of the theory are pseudo-differential operators with Moyal
algebraic coefficients. The new hierarchy can be interpreted as large-$N$ limit
of multi-component ($\gl(N)$ symmetric) KP hierarchies. Actually, two different
hierarchies are constructed. The first hierarchy consists of commuting flows
and may be thought of as a straightforward extension of the ordinary and
multi-component KP hierarchies. The second one is a hierarchy of noncommuting
flows, and related to Moyal algebraic deformations of selfdual gravity. Both
hierarchies turn out to possess quasi-classical limit, replacing Moyal
algebraic structures by Poisson algebraic structures. The language of
W-infinity algebras provides a unified point of view to these results.
