  We remark that the weak coupling regime of the stochastic stabilization of 2D
quantum gravity has a unique perturbative vacuum, which does not support
instanton configurations. By means of Monte Carlo simulations we show that the
nonperturbative vacuum is also confined in one potential well. Nonperturbative
effects can be assessed in the loop equation. This can be derived from the Ward
identities of the stabilized model and is shown to be modified by
nonperturbative terms.
