Title: Hamilton's Formalism for Systems with Constraints
Authors: Andreas W. Wipf
Comments: 52 pages, revised LATEX version, ETH-TH/93-48, Lectures given at the
  Seminar "The Canonical Formalism in Classical and Quantum General
  Relativity", Bad Honnef, September 93
\\
  The main goal of these lectures is to introduce and review the Hamiltonian
formalism for classical constrained systems and in particular gauge theories.
Emphasis is put on the relation between local symmetries and constraints and on
the relation between Lagrangean and Hamiltonian symmetries.
