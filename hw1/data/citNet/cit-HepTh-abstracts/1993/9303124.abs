Title: Relativistic Dynamics of Spin in Strong External Fields
Authors: J.W. van Holten
Comments: 11 pages, NIKHEF-H/93-06
\\
  The dynamics of relativistic spinning particles in strong external
electromagnetic or gravitational fields is discussed. Spin-orbit coupling is
shown to affect such relativistic phenomena as time-dilation and perihelion
shift. Possible applications include muon decay in a magnetic field and the
dynamics of neutron stars in binary systems.
