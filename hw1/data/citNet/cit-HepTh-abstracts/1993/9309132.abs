  We present a second order gravity action which consists of ordinary Einstein
action augmented by a first-order, vector like, Chern-Simons quasi topological
term. This theory is ghost-free and propagates a pure spin-2 mode. It is
diffeomorphism invariant, although its local Lorentz invariance has been
spontaneuosly broken. We perform the light-front (LF) analysis for both the
linearized system and the exact curved model. In constrast to the 2+1 canonical
analysis, in the quasi LF coordinates the differential constraints can be
solved. Its solution is presented here.
