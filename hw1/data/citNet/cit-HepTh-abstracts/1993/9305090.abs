  Gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten theory for compact groups is considered. It is
shown that this theory has fermionic BRST-like symmetry and may be exactly
solved using localization approach. As an example we calculate functional
integral for the case of SU(2) group on the arbitrary Riemann surface. The
answer is the particular case of Verlinde formula for the number of conformal
blocks.
