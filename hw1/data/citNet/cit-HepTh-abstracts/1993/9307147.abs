  The discrete models of the Toda and Volterra chains are being constructed out
of the continuum two-boson KP hierarchies. The main tool is the discrete
symmetry preserving the Hamiltonian structure of the continuum models. The
two-boson currents of KP hierarchy are being associated with sites of the
corresponding chain by successive actions of discrete symmetry.
