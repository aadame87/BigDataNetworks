  We present a large-$N$ collective field formalism for anyons in external
magnetic fields interacting with arbitrary two-body potential. We discuss how
the Landau level is reproduced in our framework. We apply it to the soluble
model for anyons proposed by Girvin et al., and obtain the dispersion relation
of collective modes for arbitrary statistical parameters.
