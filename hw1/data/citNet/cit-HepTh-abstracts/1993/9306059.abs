  After reviewing some aspects of gravity in two dimensions, it is shown that
non-trivial embeddings of sl(2) in a semi-simple (super) Lie algebra give rise
to a very large class of extensions of 2D gravity. The induced action is
constructed as a gauged WZW model and an exact expression for the effective
action is given. (Talk presented at the Journees Relativistes '93, Brussels,
April, 1993).
