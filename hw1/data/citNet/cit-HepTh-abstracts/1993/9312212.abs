  Some approaches to $2d$ gravity developed for the last years are reviewed.
They are physical (Liouville) gravity, topological theories and matrix models.
A special attention is paid to matrix models and their interrelations with
different approaches. Almost all technical details are omitted, but examples
are presented.
