  We give a complete classification of all simple current modular invariants,
extending previous results for $(\Zbf_p)^k$ to arbitrary centers. We obtain a
simple explicit formula for the most general case. Using orbifold techniques to
this end, we find a one-to-one correspondence between simple current invariants
and subgroups of the center with discrete torsions.  As a by-product, we prove
the conjectured monodromy independence of the total number of such invariants.
The orbifold approach works in a straightforward way for symmetries of odd
order, but some modifications are required to deal with symmetries of even
order. With these modifications the orbifold construction with discrete torsion
is complete within the class of simple current invariants. Surprisingly, there
are cases where discrete torsion is a necessity rather than a possibility.
