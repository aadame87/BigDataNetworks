  We show how to obtain the ultraviolet central charge from the exact S-matrix
for a wide variety of models with a $U(1)$ symmetry. This is done by coupling
the $U(1)$ current $J$ to a background field. In an $N$=2 superconformal theory
with $J$ the fermion number current, the OPE of $J$ with itself and hence the
free energy are proportional to $c$. By deforming the supersymmetry into affine
$\widehat SU(2)_q$ quantum-group symmetry, this result can be generalized to
many $U(1)$-invariant theories, including the N=0 and N=1 sine-Gordon models
and the $SU(2)_k$ WZW models. This provides a consistency check on a
conjectured S-matrix completely independent of the finite-size effects
expressed in terms of dilogarithms resulting from the thermodynamic Bethe
ansatz.
