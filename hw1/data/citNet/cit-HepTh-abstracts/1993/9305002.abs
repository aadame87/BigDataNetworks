Title: Quantum Mechanical Interaction-Free Measurements
Authors: Avshalom C. Elitzur and Lev Vaidman
Comments: (revised file with no need for macro), 12, TAUP 1865-91#
\\
  A novel manifestation of nonlocality of quantum mechanics is presented. It is
shown that it is possible to ascertain the existence of an object in a given
region of space without interacting with it. The method might have practical
applications for delicate quantum experiments.
