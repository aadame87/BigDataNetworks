  The scalar functional determinants on sectors of the two-dimensional disc and
spherical cap are determined for arbitrary angles (rational factors of $\pi$).
The wholesphere and hemisphere expressions are also given, in low dimensions,
for both the ordinary and the conformal Laplacian. Comparisons are made with
other work.
