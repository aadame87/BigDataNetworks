  The finite-volume spectrum of an integrable massive perturbation of a
rational conformal field theory interpolates between massive multi-particle
states in infinite volume (IR limit) and conformal states, which are approached
at zero volume (UV limit). Each state is labeled in the IR by a set of `Bethe
Ansatz quantum numbers', while in the UV limit it is characterized primarily by
the conformal dimensions of the conformal field creating it. We present
explicit conjectures for the UV conformal dimensions corresponding to any IR
state in the $\phi_{1,3}$-perturbed minimal models $M(2,5)$ and $M(3,5)$. The
conjectures, which are based on a combinatorial interpretation of the
Rogers-Ramanujan-Schur identities, are consistent with numerical results
obtained previously for low-lying energy levels.
