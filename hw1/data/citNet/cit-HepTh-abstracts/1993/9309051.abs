  I study the quantum mechanics of a spin interacting with an ``apparatus''.
Although the evolution of the whole system is unitary, the spin evolution is
not. The system is chosen so that the spin exhibits loss of quantum coherence,
or ``wavefunction collapse'', of the sort usually associated with a quantum
measurement. The system is analyzed from the point of view of the spin density
matrix (or ``Schmidt paths''), and also using the consistent histories
approach. These two points of view are contrasted with each other. Connections
between the results and the form of the Hamiltonian are discussed in detail.
