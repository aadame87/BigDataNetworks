  The representations of the observable algebra of a low dimensional quantum
field theory form the objects of a braided tensor category. The search for
gauge symmetry in the theory amounts to finding an algebra which has the same
representation category. In this paper we try to establish that every quantum
field theory satisfying some basic axioms posseses a weak quasi Hopf algebra as
gauge symmetry. The first step is to construct a functor from the
representation category to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces.
Given such a functor we can use a generalized reconstruction theorem to find
the symmetry algebra. It is shown how this symmetry algebra is used to build a
gauge covariant field algebra and we investigate the question why this
generality is necessary.
