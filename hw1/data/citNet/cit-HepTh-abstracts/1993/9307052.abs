  Theories

  After reviewing the basic aspects of the exactly solvable quantum-corrected
dilaton-gravity theories in two dimensions, we discuss a (subjective) selection
of other aspects: a) supersymmetric extensions, b) canonical formalism,
ADM-mass, and the functional integral measure, and c) a positive energy theorem
and its application to the ADM- and Bondi-masses.
