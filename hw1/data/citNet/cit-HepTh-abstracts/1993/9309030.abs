  We investigate the seven-sphere as a group-like manifold and its extension to
a Kac-Moody-like algebra. Covariance properties and tensorial composition of
spinors under $S^7$ are defined. The relation to Malcev algebras is
established. The consequences for octonionic projective spaces are examined.
Current algebras are formulated and their anomalies are derived, and shown to
be unique (even regarding numerical coefficients) up to redefinitions of the
currents. Nilpotency of the BRST operator is consistent with one particular
expression in the class of (field-dependent) anomalies. A Sugawara construction
is given.
