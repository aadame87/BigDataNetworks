  We have generalized recent results of Cappelli, Trugenberger and Zemba on the
integer quantum Hall effect constructing explicitly a ${\cal W}_{1+\infty}$ for
the fractional quantum Hall effect such that the negative modes annihilate the
Laughlin wave functions. This generalization has a nice interpretation in
Jain's composite fermion theory. Furthermore, for these models we have
calculated the wave functions of the edge excitations viewing them as area
preserving deformations of an incompressible quantum droplet, and have shown
that the ${\cal W}_{1+\infty}$ is the underlying symmetry of the edge
excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Finally, we have applied
this method to more general wave functions.
