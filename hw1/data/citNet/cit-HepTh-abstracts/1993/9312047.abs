  We construct a string field Hamiltonian for a noncritical string theory with
the continuum limit of the Ising model or its generalization as the matter
theory on the worldsheet. It consists of only three string vertices as in the
case for $c=0$. We also discuss a general consistency condition that should be
satisfied by this kind of string field Hamiltonian.
