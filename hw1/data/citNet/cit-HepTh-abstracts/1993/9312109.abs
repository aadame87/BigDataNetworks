  We present the scalar field effective potential for nonrelativistic
self-interacting scalar and fermion fields coupled to an Abelian Chern-Simons
gauge field. Fermions are non-minimally coupled to the gauge field via a Pauli
interaction. Gauss's law linearly relates the magnetic field to the matter
field densities; hence, we also include radiative effects from the background
gauge field. However, the scalar field effective potential is transparent to
the presence of the background gauge field to leading order in the perturbative
expansion. We compute the scalar field effective potential in two gauge
families. We perform the calculation in a gauge reminiscent of the
$R_\xi$-gauge in the limit $\xi\rightarrow 0$ and in the Coulomb family gauges.
The scalar field effective potential is the same in both gauge-fixings and is
independent of the gauge-fixing parameter in the Coulomb family gauge. The
conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken except for two values of the
coupling constant, one of which is the self-dual value. To leading order in the
perturbative expansion, the structure of the classical potential is deeply
distorted by radiative corrections and shows a stable minimum around the
origin, which could be of interest when searching for vortex solutions. We
regularize the theory with operator regularization and a cutoff to demonstrate
that the results are independent of the regularization scheme.
