  We extend the theory of the gauging of classical quadratically nonlinear
algebras without a central charge but with a coset structure, to the quantum
level. Inserting the minimal anomalies into the classical transformation rules
of the currents introduces further quantum corrections to the classical
transformation rules of the gauge fields and currents which additively
renormalize the structure constants. The corresponding Ward identities are the
c -> infinity limit of the full quantum Ward identities, and reveal that the c
-> infinity limit of the quantum gauge algebra closes on fields and currents.
Two examples are given.
