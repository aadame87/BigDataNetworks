  We discuss new results in QCD obtained with string-based methods. These
methods were originally derived from superstring theory and are significantly
more efficient than conventional Feynman rules. This technology was a key
ingredient in the first calculation of the one-loop five-gluon amplitude. We
also present a conjecture for a particular one-loop helicity amplitude with an
arbitrary number of external gluons.
