  We formulate the basic properties of q-vertex operators in the context of the
Andrews-Baxter-Forrester (ABF) series, as an example of face-interaction
models, derive the q-difference equations satisfied by their correlation
functions, and establish their connection with representation theory. We also
discuss the q-difference equations of the Kashiwara-Miwa (KM) series, as an
example of edge-interaction models. Next, the Ising model--the simplest special
case of both ABF and KM series--is studied in more detail using the
Jordan-Wigner fermions. In particular, all matrix elements of vertex operators
are calculated.
