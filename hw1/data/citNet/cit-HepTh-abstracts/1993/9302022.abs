  We study the black hole information paradox in the context of a
two-dimensional toy model given by dilaton gravity coupled to $N$ massless
scalar fields. After making the model well-defined by imposing reflecting
boundary conditions at a critical value of the dilaton field, we quantize the
theory and derive the quantum quantum $S$-matrix for the case that $N$=$24$.
This $S$-matrix is unitary by construction, and we further argue that in the
semiclassical regime it describes the formation and subsequent Hawking
evaporation of two-dimensional black holes. Finally, we note an interesting
correspondence between the dilaton gravity $S$-matrix and that of the $c=1$
matrix model.
