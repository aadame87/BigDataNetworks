Title: Conformal Blocks of Coset Construction: Zero Ghost Number
Authors: M.Yu.Lashkevich
Comments: 10 pages, preprint LANDAU-92-TMP-1, October 1992 (References added)
\\
  It is shown that zero ghost conformal blocks of coset theory G/H are
determined uniquely by those of G and H theories. G/G theories are considered
as an example, their structure constants and correlation functions on sphere
are calculated.
