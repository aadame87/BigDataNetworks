  In the present article we present exact solutions of the Dirac equation for
electric neutral particles with anomalous electric and magnetic moments. Using
the algebraic method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation is
separated in cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, and exact
solutions are obtained in terms of special functions.
