  We consider representations of quadratic $R$-matrix algebras
by means of certain first order ordinary differential operators.
These operators turn out to act as parameter shifting operators on
the Gauss hypergeometric function and its limit cases and on classical
orthogonal polynomials. The relationship with W. Miller's treatment of
Lie algebras of first order differential operators will be discussed.
