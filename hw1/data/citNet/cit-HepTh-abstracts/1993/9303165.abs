  We verify that the fractional KdV equation is a bi-hamiltonian system using
the zero curvature equation in $SL(3)$ matrix valued Lax pair representation,
and explicitly find the closed form for the hamiltonian operators of the
system. The second hamiltonian operator is the classical version of the
$W^{(2)}_3$ algebra. We also construct systematically the Miura map of
$W^{(2)}_3$ algebra using a gauge transformation of the $SL(3)$ matrix valued
Lax operator in a particular gauge, and construct the modified fractional KdV
equaiotn as hamiltonian system.
