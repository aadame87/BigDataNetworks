  Quantum canonical transformations are used to derive the integral
representations and Kummer solutions of the confluent hypergeometric and
hypergeometric equations. Integral representations of the solutions of the
non-periodic three body Toda equation are also found. The derivation of these
representations motivate the form of a two-dimensional generalized
hypergeometric equation which contains the non-periodic Toda equation as a
special case and whose solutions may be obtained by quantum canonical
transformation.
