Title: Some Speculations about Black Hole Entropy in String Theory
Authors: Leonard Susskind
Comments: 11 pp., 5 figures (amstex)
\\
  The classical Bekenstein entropy of a black hole is argued to arise from
configurations of strings with ends which are frozen on the horizon. Quantum
corrections to this entropy are probably finite unlike the case in quantum
field theory. Finally it is speculated that all black holes are single string
states. The level density of strings is of the right order of magnitude to
reproduce the Bekenstein entropy.
