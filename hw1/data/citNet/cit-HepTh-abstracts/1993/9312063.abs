  We study the thermal behavior of the negative dimensional harmonic oscillator
of Dunne and Halliday that at zero temperature, due to a hidden BRST symmetry
of the classical harmonic oscillator, is shown to be equivalent to the
Grassmann oscillator of Finkelstein and Villasante. At finite temperature we
verify that although being described by Grassmann numbers the thermal behavior
of the negative dimensional oscillator is quite different from a Fermi system.
