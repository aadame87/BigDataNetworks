Title: The Space-Time Manifold as a Critical Solid

  It is argued that the problems of the cosmological constant, stability and
renormalizability of quantum gravity can be solved if the space-time manifold
arises through spontaneous symmetry breaking. A ``pre-manifold" model is
presented in which many points are connected by random bonds. A set of $D$ real
numbers assigned to each point are coupled between points connected by bonds.
It is then found that the dominant configuration of bonds is a flat
$D$-dimensional manifold, on which there is a massless matter field.
Long-wavelength fluctuations can describe quantized massless gravity if
$D=\;4$, $6$, $8...$.
