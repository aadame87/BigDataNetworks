  Highest weight representations of $U_q(su(1,1))$ with $q=\exp \pi i/N$ are
investigated. The structures of the irreducible hieghesat weight modules are
discussed in detail. The Clebsch-Gordan decomposition for the tensor product of
two irreducible representations is discussed. By using the results, a
representation of $SL(2,R)\otimes U_q(su(2))$ is also presented in terms of
holomorphic sections which also have $U_q(su(2))$ index. Furthermore we realise
$Z_N$-graded supersymmetry in terms of the representation. An explicit
realization of $Osp(1 \vert 2)$ via the heighest weight representation of
$U_q(su(1,1))$ with $q^2=-1$ is given.
