  We perform a perturbative analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm problem to one loop
in a field-theoretic formulation, and show that contact interactions are
necessary for renormalizability. In general, the classical scale invariance of
this problem is broken quantum mechanically. There exists however a critical
point for which this anomaly disappears.
