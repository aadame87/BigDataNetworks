  The supersymmetry properties of the asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes
of Einstein theory in 2+1 dimensions are investigated. It is shown that (i) the
zero mass black hole has two exact super- symmetries; (ii) extreme $lM=|J|$
black holes with $M \not= 0$ have only one; and (iii) generic black holes do
not have any. It is also argued that the zero mass hole is the ground state of
(1,1)-adS supergravity with periodic (``Ramond") boundary conditions on the
spinor fields.
