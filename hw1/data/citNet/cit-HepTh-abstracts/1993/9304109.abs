Title: Non-Perturbative 2-Dimensional String Theory
Authors: Spenta R. Wadia
Comments: 18p, TIFR-TH-93-17
\\
  We review some aspects of the non-perturbative formulation of 2-dim. string
theory in terms of non-relativistic fermions. We derive the bosonization using
$W_\infty$ coherent states in the path-integral formulation. We discuss the
classical limit and indicate the precise nature of the truncation of the full
theory that leads to collective field theory. As applications we briefly
discuss classical solutions reponsible for stringy non-perturbative effects and
the 2-dim. black-hole.
