  We argue that the algebra $W_q(n)$, generated by $n$ pairs of deformed
$q$-bosons, does not allow a Hopfalgebra structure. To this end we show that it
is impossible to define a comultiplication even for the usual, nondeformed
case. We indicate how the comultiplication on $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ can be used in
order to construct representations of deformed (not necessarily Hopf) algebras
in tensor products of Fock spaces.
