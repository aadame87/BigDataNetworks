  An algebraic treatment of shape-invariant potentials is discussed. By
introducing an operator which reparametrizes wavefunctions, the
shape-invariance condition can be related to a generalized Heisenberg- Weyl
algebra. It is shown that this makes it possible to define a coherent state
associated with the shape-invariant potentials.
