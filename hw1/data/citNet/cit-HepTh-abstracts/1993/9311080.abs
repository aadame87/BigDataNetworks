  We study the cosmological meaning of duality symmetry by considering a two
dimensional model of string cosmology. We find that as seen by an internal
observer in this universe, the scale factor rebounds at the self-dual length.
This rebound is a consequence of the adiabatic expansion. Furthermore, in this
situation there are four mathematically different scenarios which describe
physically equivalent universes which are in fact indistinguishable. We also
stress that $R$-duality suffices to prove that all possible evolutions present
a maximum temperature.
