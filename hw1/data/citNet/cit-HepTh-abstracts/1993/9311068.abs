  We review the construction of particle physics models in the framework of
non-commutative geometry. We first give simple examples, and then progress to
outline the Connes-Lott construction of the standard Weinberg-Salam model and
our construction of the SO(10) model. We then discuss the analogue of the
Einstein-Hilbert action and gravitational matter couplings. Finally we
speculate on some experimental signatures of predictions specific to the
non-commutative approach.
