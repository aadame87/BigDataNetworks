  The even and odd coherent states are generalized for multimode case. The
explicit forms for the photon distribution, Q-function and Wigner function are
derived. In particular, it is shown that for two-mode case there exist strong
correlations between these modes, under certain conditions, which are
responsible for two-mode squeezing in case of even coherent states
