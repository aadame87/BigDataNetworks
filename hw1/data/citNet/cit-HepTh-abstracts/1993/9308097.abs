Title: Positive Definite Gravitational Action, Cosmological Constant and
  Superstring Theory

  We use the recently discovered universality of Einstein equations in the
first order formalism to suggest a positive definite Euclidean action. Possible
implications for quantum gravity are considered. We discuss the Hawking and
Coleman approach to the vanishing of the cosmological constant by using the new
action and find that the cosmological constant is probably zero. A possible
scenario for obtaining such an action from superstring field theory is
discussed.
