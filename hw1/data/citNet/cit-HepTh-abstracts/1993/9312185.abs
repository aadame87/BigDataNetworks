  We investigate the cohomology structure of a general noncritical
$W_N$-string. We do this by introducing a new basis in the Hilbert space in
which the BRST operator splits into a ``nested'' sum of nilpotent BRST
operators. We give explicit details for the case $N=3$. In that case the BRST
operator $Q$ can be written as the sum of two, mutually anticommuting,
nilpotent BRST operators: $Q=Q_0+Q_1$. We argue that if one chooses for the
Liouville sector a $(p,q)$ $W_3$ minimal model then the cohomology of the $Q_1$
operator is closely related to a $(p,q)$ Virasoro minimal model. In particular,
the special case of a (4,3) unitary $W_3$ minimal model with central charge
$c=0$ leads to a $c=1/2$ Ising model in the $Q_1$ cohomology. Despite all this,
noncritical $W_3$ strings are not identical to noncritical Virasoro strings.
