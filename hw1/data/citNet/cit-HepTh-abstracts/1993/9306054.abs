  All anomaly candidates and the form of the most general invariant local
action are given for old and new minimal supergravity, including the cases
where additional Yang--Mills and chiral matter multiplets are present.
Furthermore nonminimal supergravity is discussed. In this case local
supersymmetry itself may be anomalous and some of the corresponding anomaly
candidates are given explicitly. The results are obtained by solving the
descent equations which contain the consistency equation satisfied by
integrands of anomalies and invariant actions.
