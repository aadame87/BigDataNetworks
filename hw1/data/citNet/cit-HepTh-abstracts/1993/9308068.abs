\\
  An infinite family of cornucopions is found within the $SU(2)\times U(1)$
sector of the 4--d heterotic string low-energy theory, the extremal $U(1)$
magnetic dilatonic black hole being the lowest energy state. Non-abelian
cornucopions are interpreted as sphalerons associated with potential barriers
separating topologically distinct Yang-Mills vacua on the $U(1)$ cornucopion
background. A mass formula for non-abelian dilatonic black holes is derived,
and the free energy is calculated through the Euclidean action.
