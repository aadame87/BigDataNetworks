Title: Ideal Gas of Strings and QCD at Hadronic Scales
Authors: Chung-I Tan
Comments: 6pp., plain tex, (2 figs. not included), Brown HET-879, Brown TA-483
\\
  By using lessons learned from modern string studies, we show how interesting
non-perturbative features of QCD can be learned from future heavy ion
collisions even if the deconfinement density is not reached.
