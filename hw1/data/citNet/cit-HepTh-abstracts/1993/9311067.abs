  The non-isospectral symmetries of a general class of integrable hierarchies
are found, generalizing the Galilean and scaling symmetries of the Korteweg--de
Vries equation and its hierarchy. The symmetries arise in a very natural way
from the semi-direct product structure of the Virasoro algebra and the affine
Kac--Moody algebra underlying the construction of the hierarchy. In particular,
the generators of the symmetries are shown to satisfy a subalgebra of the
Virasoro algebra. When a tau-function formalism is available, the infinitesimal
symmetries act directly on the tau-functions as moments of Virasoro currents.
Some comments are made regarding the r\^ole of the non-isospectral symmetries
and the form of the string equations in matrix-model formulations of quantum
gravity in two-dimensions and related systems.
