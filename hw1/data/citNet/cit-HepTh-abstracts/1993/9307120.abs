  Recently, the free energy of the target space mean field (TSMF) matrix model
has been calculated in the low temperature phase, order-by-order in a low
temperature expansion. The TSMF model is a matrix model whose discrete target
space has an infinite coordination number, and whose free energy assumes a
universal form, corresponding to baby universes joined into a tree. Here the
free energy is summed to all orders, and expressed through a transcendental
algebraic equation, using which we analyze the critical phenomena that occur in
the TSMF model. There are two critical curves, at which the matter and the
geometry become critical, and for which the critical exponents are alpha = 1/2
and gamma_str = -1/2, respectively. There is a bicritical point where the
curves meet, at which gamma_str = +1/3.
