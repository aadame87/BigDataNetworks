  We consider the deformation of the Schwarzschild solution in general
relativity due to spherically symmetric quantum fluctuations of the metric and
the matter fields. In this case, the 4D theory of gravity with Einstein action
reduces to the effective two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We have found that
the Schwarzschild singularity at $r=0$ is shifted to the finite radius $r_{min}
\sim r_{Pl}$, where the scalar curvature is finite, so that the space-time
looks regular and consists of two asymptotically flat sheets glued at the
hypersurface of constant radius.
