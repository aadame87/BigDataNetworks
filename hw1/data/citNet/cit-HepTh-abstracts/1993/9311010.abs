  We consider gauged WZW models based on a four dimensional non-semi-simple
group. We obtain conformal $\s$-models in $D=3$ spacetime dimensions (with
exact central charge $c=3$) by axially and vectorially gauging a
one-dimensional subgroup. The model obtained in the axial gauging is related to
the $3D$ black string after a correlated limit is taken in the latter model. By
identifying the CFT corresponding to these $\s$-models we compute the exact
expressions for the metric and dilaton fields. All of our models can be mapped
to flat spacetimes with zero antisymmetric tensor and dilaton fields via
duality transformations.
