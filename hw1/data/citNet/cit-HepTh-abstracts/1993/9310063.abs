  By considering the scaling behaviour of various Feynman graphs at leading
order in large $\Nf$ at the non-trivial fixed point of the $d$-dimensional
$\beta$-function of QCD we deduce the critical exponents corresponding to the
quark, gluon and ghost anomalous dimensions as well as the anomalous dimensions
of the quark-quark-gluon and ghost-ghost-gluon vertices in the Landau gauge. As
the exponents encode all orders information on the perturbation series of the
corresponding renormalization group functions we find agreement with the known
three loop structure and, moreover, we provide new information at all
subsequent orders.
