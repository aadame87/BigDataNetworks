  We develop the method of the hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie
superalgebras to obtain explicit and general expressions both for the classical
and the quantum extended superconformal algebras. By performing the gauge
transformation which connects the diagonal gauge with the Drinfeld-Sokolov
gauge and considering the quantum corrections, we get generic expressions for
the classical and quantum free field realizations of the algebras.
