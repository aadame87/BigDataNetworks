  We discuss the properties of the supersymmetric $t$-$J$ model in the
formalism of the slave operators. In particular we introduce a generalized
abelian bosonization for the model in two dimensions, and show that holons and
spinons can be anyons of arbitrary complementary statistics (slave anyon
representation). The braiding properties of these anyonic operators are
thoroughly analyzed, and are used to provide an explicit linear realization of
the superalgebra $SU(1|2)$. Finally, we prove that the Hamiltonian of the
$t$-$J$ model in the slave anyon representation is invariant under $SU(1|2)$
for $J=2\,t$.
