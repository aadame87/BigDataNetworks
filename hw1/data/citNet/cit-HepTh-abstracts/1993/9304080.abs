  In this talk we report some results about the construction of soliton
solutions for the Affine and Conformal Affine Toda models using the Hirota's
method. We obtain new classes of solitons connected to the degeneracies of the
Cartan matrix eigenvalues as well as to some particular features of the
recursive scheme developed here. We obtain an universal mass formula for all
those solitons. The examples of $SU(6)$ and $Sp(3)$ are discussed in some
detail. ( Talk presented at the VII J.A. Swieca Summer School, Section:
