  The antifields of the Batalin-Vilkovisky Lagrangian quantization are standard
antighosts of certain collective fields. These collective fields ensure that
Schwinger-Dyson equations are satisfied as a consequence of the gauge symmetry
algebra. The associated antibracket and its canonical structure appear
naturally if one integrates out the corresponding ghost fields. An analogous
Master Equation for the action involving these ghosts follows from the
requirement that the path integral gives rise to the correct Schwinger-Dyson
equations.
