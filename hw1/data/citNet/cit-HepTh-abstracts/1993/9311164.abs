  In this paper the several aspects of the $Z_{N}$ symmetry in gauge theories
at high temperatures are discussed.  The metastable $Z_{N}$ bubbles in the
$SU(N)$ gauge theories with fermions may have, generically, unacceptable
thermodynamic behavior. Their free energy $F \propto T^4$ with a positive
proportionality constant. This leads not only to negative pressure but also to
negative specific heat and, more seriously, to negative entropy. We argue that
although such domains are important in the Euclidean theory, they cannot be
interpreted as physical domains in Minkowski space.  The related problem is
connected with the analysis of the high-temperature limit of the confining
phase. Using the two-dimensional QCD with adjoint fermions as a toy model we
shall demonstrate that in the light fermion limit in this theory there is no
breaking of the $Z_{N}$ symmetry in the high-temperature limit and thus there
are no $Z_{N}$ bubbles.
