  We present a thorough analysis of the Non Intersecting String (NIS) model and
its exact solution. This is an integrable $q$-states vertex model describing
configurations of non-intersecting polygons on the lattice. The exact
eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are found by analytic Bethe Ansatz. The
Bethe Ansatz equations thus found are shown to be equivalent to those for a
mixed spin model involving both 1/2 and infinite spin. This indicates that the
NIS model provides a representation of the quantum group $SU(2)_{\hat q}$
($|\hat q|\not= 1$) corresponding to spins $s=1/2$ and $s=\infty$. The
partition function and the excitations in the thermodynamic limit are computed.
