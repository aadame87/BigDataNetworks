  Braided differential operators $\del^i$ are obtained by differentiating the
addition law on the braided covector spaces introduced previously (such as the
braided addition law on the quantum plane). These are affiliated to a
Yang-Baxter matrix $R$. The quantum eigenfunctions $\exp_R(\vecx|\vecv)$ of the
$\del^i$ (braided-plane waves) are introduced in the free case where the
position components $x_i$ are totally non-commuting. We prove a braided
$R$-binomial theorem and a braided-Taylors theorem
$\exp_R(\veca|\del)f(\vecx)=f(\veca+\vecx)$. These various results precisely
generalise to a generic $R$-matrix (and hence to $n$-dimensions) the well-known
properties of the usual 1-dimensional $q$-differential and $q$-exponential. As
a related application, we show that the q-Heisenberg algebra $px-qxp=1$ is a
braided semidirect product $\C[x]\cocross \C[p]$ of the braided line acting on
itself (a braided Weyl algebra). Similarly for its generalization to an
arbitrary $R$-matrix.
