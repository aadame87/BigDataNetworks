  The 2D lattice gauge theory with a quantum gauge group $SL_q(2)$ is
considered. When $q=e^{i\frac{2\pi}{k+2}}$, its weak coupling partition
function coincides with the one of the G/G coset model ({\em i.e.} equals the
Verlinde numbers). However, despite such a remarkable coincidence, these models
are not equivalent but, in some certain sense, dual to each other.
