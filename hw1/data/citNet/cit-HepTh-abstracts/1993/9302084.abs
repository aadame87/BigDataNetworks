  The most general R-matrix type state sum model for link invariants is
constructed. It contains in itself all R-matrix invariants and is a generating
function for "universal" Vassiliev link invariants. This expression is more
simple than Kontsevich's expression for the same quantity, because it is
defined combinatorially and does not contain any integrals, except for an
expression for "the universal Drinfeld's associator".
