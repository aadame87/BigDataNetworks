  A general procedure for deriving the path integral representation of a
transition amplitude on the gauge orbit space having a non-trivial topology is
proposed. The path integral formula appears to be modified by including
trajectories reflected from the physical configuration space boundary into the
sum over paths. A solution of the Gribov problem of gauge fixing ambiguities is
given in the framework of the path integral modified. Email contact:
