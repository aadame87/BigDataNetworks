  We consider a model which effectively restricts the functional integral of
Yang--Mills theories to the fundamental modular region. Using algebraic
arguments, we prove that this theory has the same divergences as ordinary Yang
Mills theory in the Landau gauge and that it is unitary. The restriction of the
functional integral is interpreted as a kind of spontaneous breakdown of the
$BRS$ symmetry.
