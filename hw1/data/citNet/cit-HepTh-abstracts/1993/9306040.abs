  A formalism describing the dynamics of classical and quantum systems from a
group theoretical point of view is presented. We apply it to the simple example
of the classical free particle. The Galileo group $G$ is the symmetry group of
the free equations of motion. Consideration of the free particle Lagrangian
semi-invariance under $G$ leads to a larger symmetry group, which is a central
extension of the Galileo group by the real numbers. We study the dynamics
associated with this group, and characterize quantities like Noether invariants
and evolution equations in terms of group geometric objects. An extension of
the Galileo group by $U(1)$ leads to quantum mechanics.
