Title: Differential geometry of the space of orbits of a Coxeter group
Authors: Boris Dubrovin
Comments: 30 pages, plain TeX, SISSA-29/93/FM
\\
  Differential-geometric structures on the space of orbits of a finite Coxeter
group, determined by Groth\'endieck residues, are calculated. This gives a
construction of a 2D topological field theory for an arbitrary Coxeter group.
