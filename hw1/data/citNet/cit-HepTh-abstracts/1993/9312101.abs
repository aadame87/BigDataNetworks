   A representation-theoretic approach to special functions was developed
in the 40-s and 50-s in the works of I.M.Gelfand, M.A.Naimark, N.Ya.Vilenkin,
and their collaborators. The essence of this approach is the fact that most
classical special functions can be obtained as suitable specializations of
matrix elements or characters of representations of groups. Another rich
source of special functions is the theory of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
which describes the geometric juxtaposition of irreducible components inside
the tensor product of two representations. Finally, in recent works on
representations of (quantum) affine Lie algebras it was shown that matrix
elements of intertwining operators between certain representations of these
algebras are interesting special functions -- (q-)hypergeometric
functions and their generalizations.
   In this paper we suggest a general method of getting special functions
from representation theory which unifies the three methods mentioned
above and allows one to define and study many new special functions.
We illustrate this method by a number of examples -- Macdonald's polynomials,
eigenfunctions of the Sutherland operator, Lame functions.
