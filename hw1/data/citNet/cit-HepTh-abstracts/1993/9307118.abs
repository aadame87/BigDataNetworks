  We present a formalism that extends the Majorana-construction to arbitrary
spin $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ representation spaces. For the example case of
spin-$1$, a wave equation satisfied by the Majorana-like $(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$
spinors is constructed and its physical content explored. The
$(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ Majorana-construct is found to possess an unusual classical
and quantum field theoretic structure. Relevance of our formalism to parity
violation, hadronic phenomenologies, and grand unified field theories is
briefly pointed out.
