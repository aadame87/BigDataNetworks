  Consideration of the model of the relativistic particle with curvature and
torsion in the three-dimensional space-time shows that the squaring of the
primary constraints entails a wrong result. The complete set of the Hamiltonian
constraints arising here correspond to another model with an action similar but
not identical with the initial action.
