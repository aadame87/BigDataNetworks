Title: Self-Dual Spin-3 And 4 Theories
Authors: C. Aragone & A. Khoudeir
Comments: 10, IC/91-204
\\
  We present self-dual spin-3 and 4 actions using relevant dreibein fields.
since these actions start with a Chern-Simons like kinetic term (and therefore
cannot be obtained through dimensional reduction) one might wonder whether they
need the presence of auxiliary ghost-killings fields. It turns out that they
must contain, also in this three dimensional case, auxiliary fields. They do
not break self-duality: their free actions do not contain kinetic second order
terms.
