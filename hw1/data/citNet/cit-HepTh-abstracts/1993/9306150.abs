  This is the first part of an investigation concerning the formulation of 2D
gravity in the framework of the uniformization theory of Riemann surfaces. As a
first step in this direction we show that the classical Liouville action
appears in the expression of the correlators of topological gravity. Next we
derive an inequality involving the cutoff of 2D gravity and the background
geometry. Another result, always related to uniformization theory, concerns a
relation between the higher genus normal ordering and the Liouville action.
Furthermore, we show that the chirally split anomaly of CFT is equivalent to
the Krichever-Novikov cocycle. By means of the inverse map of uniformization we
give a realization of the Virasoro algebra on arbitrary Riemann surfaces and
find the eigenfunctions for {\it holomorphic} covariant operators defining
higher order cocycles and anomalies which are related to $W$-algebras. Finally
we attack the problem of considering the positivity of $e^\sigma$, with
$\sigma$ the Liouville field, by proposing an explicit construction for the
Fourier modes on compact Riemann surfaces.
