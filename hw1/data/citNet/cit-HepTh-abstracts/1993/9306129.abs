Title: Factoring out free fields
Authors: A. Deckmyn and K. Thielemans

  effective $\Ww$ gravities" regarding regularization issues

  For a generic $\Ww$ algebra, we give an algorithmic procedure for factoring
out all fields of dimension $1/2$, both bosonic and fermionic, and some fields
of dimension $1$. This generalizes and makes more explicit the
Goddard-Schwimmer theorem for free fermions. We also show how the induced
gravity theory for the original $\Ww$ algebra containing the free fields
relates to the theory where the fields are factored out.
