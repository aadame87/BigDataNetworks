  We first review the properties of the conventional $\tau$-functions of the KP
and Toda-lattice hierarchies. A straightforward generalization is then
discussed. It corresponds to passing from differential to finite-difference
equations; it does not involve however the concept of operator-valued
$\tau$-function nor the one associated with non-Cartanian (level $k\ne1$)
algebras. The present study could be useful to understand better $q$-free
fields and their relation to ordinary free fields.
