  We present the formalism for computing the critical exponent corresponding to
the $\beta$-function of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with $SU(M)$ $\times$
$SU(M)$ continuous chiral symmetry at $O(1/N^2)$ in a large $N$ expansion,
where $N$ is the number of fermions. We find that the equations can only be
solved for the case $M$ $=$ $2$ and subsequently an analytic expression is then
derived. This contrasting behaviour between the $M$ $=$ $2$ and $M$ $>$ $2$
cases, which appears first at $O(1/N^2)$, is related to the fact that the
anomalous dimensions of the bosonic fields are only equivalent for $M$ $=$ $2$.
