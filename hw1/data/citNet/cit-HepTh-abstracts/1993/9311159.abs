  The effective action for the multi-Regge asymptotics is considered as a first
step in calculating the unitarity correction to the perturbative pomeron. It
can be derived from the original QCD action by intgrating out certain modes of
the fields in the functional integral. The derivation is described for the case
without fermions.
