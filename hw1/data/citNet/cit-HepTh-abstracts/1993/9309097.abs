  We analyze the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds and their associated
conformally invariant nonlinear sigma-models and show that they are described
by an unexpectedly rich geometrical structure. Specifically, the Kahler sector
of the moduli space of such Calabi-Yau conformal theories admits a
decomposition into adjacent domains some of which correspond to the
(complexified) Kahler cones of topologically distinct manifolds. These domains
are separated by walls corresponding to singular Calabi-Yau spaces in which the
spacetime metric has degenerated in certain regions. We show that the union of
these domains is isomorphic to the complex structure moduli space of a single
topological Calabi-Yau space---the mirror. In this way we resolve a puzzle for
mirror symmetry raised by the apparent asymmetry between the Kahler and complex
structure moduli spaces of a Calabi-Yau manifold. Furthermore, using mirror
symmetry, we show that we can interpolate in a physically smooth manner between
any two theories represented by distinct points in the Kahler moduli space,
even if such points correspond to topologically distinct spaces. Spacetime
topology change in string theory, therefore, is realized by the most basic
operation of deformation by a truly marginal operator. Finally, this work also
yields some important insights on the nature of orbifolds in string theory.
