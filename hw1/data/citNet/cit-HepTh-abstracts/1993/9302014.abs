  We propose an improved iterative scheme for calculating higher genus
contributions to the multi-loop (or multi-point) correlators and the partition
function of the hermitian one matrix model. We present explicit results up to
genus two. We develop a version which gives directly the result in the double
scaling limit and present explicit results up to genus four. Using the latter
version we prove that the hermitian and the complex matrix model are equivalent
in the double scaling limit and that in this limit they are both equivalent to
the Kontsevich model. We discuss how our results away from the double scaling
limit are related to the structure of moduli space.
