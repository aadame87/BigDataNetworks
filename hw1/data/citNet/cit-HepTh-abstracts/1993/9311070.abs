  We discuss a differential integrable hierarchy, which we call the (N, M)$--th
KdV hierarchy, whose Lax operator is obtained by properly adding $M$
pseudo--differential terms to the Lax operator of the N--th KdV hierarchy. This
new hierarchy contains both the higher KdV hierarchy and multi--field
representation of KP hierarchy as sub--systems and naturally appears in
multi--matrix models. The N+2M-1 coordinates or fields of this hierarchy
satisfy two algebras of compatible Poisson brackets which are {\it local} and
{\it polynomial}. Each Poisson structure generate an extended W_{1+\infty} and
W_\infty algebra, respectively. We call W(N, M) the generating algebra of the
extended W_\infty algebra. This algebra, which corresponds with the second
Poisson structure, shares many features of the usual $W_N$ algebra. We show
that there exist M distinct reductions of the (N, M)--th KdV hierarchy, which
are obtained by imposing suitable second class constraints. The most drastic
reduction corresponds to the (N+M)--th KdV hierarchy. Correspondingly the W(N,
M) algebra is reduced to the W_{N+M} algebra. We study in detail the
dispersionless limit of this hierarchy and the relevant reductions.
