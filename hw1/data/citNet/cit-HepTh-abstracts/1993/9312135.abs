Title: Handle Operators in R.C.F.T
Authors: Michael Crescimanno
Comments: 4 pages
\\
  For the series associated to a group or coset R.C.F.T. there is a simple
universal form for the inverse of the handle operator in the ring of fusions.
These formulae may be easily understood from the quantization of the associated
Chern-Simons theory. (Transcript of talk given at STRINGS '93 (Berkeley)
Conference)
