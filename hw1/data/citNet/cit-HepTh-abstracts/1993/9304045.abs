  We describe the mirror of the Z orbifold as a representation of a class of
generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds that can be realized as manifolds of dimension
five and seven. Despite their dimension these correspond to superconformal
theories with $c=9$ and so are perfectly good for compactifying the heterotic
string to the four dimensions of space-time. As a check of mirror symmetry we
compute the structure of the space of complex structures of the mirror and
check that this reproduces the known results for the Yukawa couplings and
metric appropriate to the Kahler class parameters on the Z orbifold together
with their instanton corrections.
