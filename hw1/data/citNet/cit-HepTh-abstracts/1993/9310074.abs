  Representations of propagators by means of path integrals over velocities are
discussed both in nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics. It is
shown that all the propagators can only be expressed through bosonic path
integrals over velocities of space-time coordinates. In the representations the
integration over velocities is not restricted by any boundary conditions;
matrices, which have to be inverted in course of doing Gaussian integrals, do
not contain any derivatives in time, and spinor and isospinor structures of the
propagators are given explicitly. One can define universal Gaussian and
quasi-Gaussian integrals over velocities and rules of handling them. Such a
technique allows one effectively calculate propagators in external fields.
Thus, Klein-Gordon propagator is found in a constant homogeneous
electromagnetic field and its combination with a plane wave field.
