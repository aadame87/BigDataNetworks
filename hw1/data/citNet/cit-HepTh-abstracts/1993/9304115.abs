  We construct BRST operators for certain higher-spin extensions of the
Virasoro algebra, in which there is a spin-$s$ gauge field on the world sheet,
as well as the spin-2 gauge field corrresponding to the two-dimensional metric.
We use these BRST operators to study the physical states of the associated
string theories, and show how they are related to certain minimal models.
