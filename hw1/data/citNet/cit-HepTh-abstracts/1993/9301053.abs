  An infinite number of free field realizations of the universal nonlinear
$\hat{W}_{\infty}^{(N)}$ ($\hat{W}_{1+\infty}^{(N)}$) algebras, which are
identical to the KP Hamiltonian structures, are obtained in terms of $p$ plus
$q$ scalars of different signatures with $p-q=N$. They are generalizations of
the Miura transformation, and naturally give rise to the modified KP
hierarchies via corresponding realizations of the latter. Their characteristic
Lie-algebraic origin is shown to be the graded $SL(p,q)$.
