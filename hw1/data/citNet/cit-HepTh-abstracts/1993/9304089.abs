  The thermal Bogoliubov transformation in thermo field dynamics is generalized
in two respects. First, a generalization of the $\alpha$--degree of freedom to
tilde non--conserving representations is considered. Secondly, the usual
$2\times2$ Bogoliubov matrix is extended to a $4\times4$ matrix including
mixing of modes with non--trivial multiparticle correlations. The analysis is
carried out for both bosons and fermions.
