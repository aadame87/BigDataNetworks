  Solvable Natanzon potentials in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics are known
to group into two disjoint classes depending on whether the Schr\"odinger
equation can be reduced to a hypergeometric or a confluent hypergeometric
equation. All the potentials within each class are connected via point
canonical transformations. We establish a connection between the two classes
with appropriate limiting procedures and redefinition of parameters, thereby
inter-relating all known solvable potentials.
