  Actions for $D=2$, $N=2$ supergravity coupled to a scalar field are
calculated, and it is shown that the most general power-counting renormalizable
dilaton gravity action has an $N=2$ locally supersymmetric extension. The
presence of chiral terms in the action leads one to hope that
non-renormalization theorems similar to those in global SUSY will apply; this
would eliminate some of the renormalization ambiguities which plague ordinary
bosonic (and $N=1$) dilaton gravity. To investigate this, the model is studied
in superconformal gauge, where it is found that one chiral term becomes
nonchiral, so that only one term is safe from renormalization.
