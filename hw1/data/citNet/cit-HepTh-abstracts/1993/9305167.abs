  The unified constrained dynamics is formulated without making use of the
Dirac splitting of constraint classes. The strengthened, completely--closed,
version of the unified constraint algebra generating equations is given. The
fundamental phase variable supercommutators are included into the unified
algebra as well. The truncated generating operator is defined to be nilpotent
in terms of which the Unitarizing Hamiltonian is constructed.
