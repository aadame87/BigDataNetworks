  Exact operator quantization is perfomed of a model of two-dimensional dilaton
gravity in Lorentzian spacetime, classically equivalent to the one proposed by
Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger, in the special case with 24 massless
matter scalars. This is accomplished by developing a non-linear and non-local
quantum canonical transformation of basic interacting fields into a set of free
fields, rigorously taking into account the spatially closed boundary condition.
The quantized model enjoys conformal invariance and the entire set of physical
states and operators are obtained in the BRST formalism. In addition, a rather
detailed discussion of the nature of the basic issues for exact treatment of
models of quantum gravity is provided.
