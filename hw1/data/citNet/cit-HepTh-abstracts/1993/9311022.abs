  We study the classical theory of a non-Abelian gauge field (gauge group
$SU(2)$) coupled to a massive dilaton, massive axion and Einstein gravity.
The theory is inspired by the bosonic part of the low-energy heterotic string
action for a general Yang-Mills field, which we consider to leading order after
compactification to $(3+1)$ dimensions. We impose the condition that spacetime
be static and spherically symmetric, and we introduce masses via a
dilaton-axion potential associated with supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking by
gaugino condensation in the hidden sector. In the course of describing the
possible non-Abelian solutions of the simplified theory, we consider in detail
two candidates: a massive dilaton coupled to a purely magnetic Yang-Mills
field, and a massive axion field coupled to a non-Abelian dyonic configuration,
in which the electric and magnetic fields decay too rapidly to correspond to
any global gauge charge. We discuss the feasibility of solutions with and
without a nontrivial dilaton for the latter case, and present numerical regular
and black hole solutions for the former.
