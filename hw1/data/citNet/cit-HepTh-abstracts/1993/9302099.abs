Title: Anomaly Cancellations and Open-String Theories

  In models of oriented closed strings, anomaly cancellations are deeply linked
to the {\it modular invariance} of the torus amplitude. If open and/or
unoriented strings are allowed, there are no non-trivial modular
transformations in the additional genus-one amplitudes (Klein bottle, annulus
and M\"obius strip). As originally recognized by Green and Schwarz, in the
ten-dimensional type-I superstring the anomaly cancellation results from a
delicate interplay between the contributions of these additional surfaces. In
lower-dimensional models, the possible presence of a number of antisymmetric
tensors yields a generalization of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. I illustrate
these results by referring to some six-dimensional chiral models, and I
conclude by addressing the additional difficulties that one meets when trying
to extend the construction to chiral four-dimensional models. (Contribution to
