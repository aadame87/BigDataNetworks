  The holographic RG flow in AdS/CFT correspondence naturally defines a
holographic scheme in which the central charge c and the beta function are
related by a universal formula. We perform some checks of that formula and we
compare it with quantum field theory expectations. We discuss alternative
definitions of the c-function. In particular, we compare, for a particular
supersymmetric flow, the holographic c-function with the central charge
computed directly from the two-point function of the stress-energy tensor.
