  Three dimensional SO(3) gauged Skyrme models characterised by specific
potentials imposing special asymptotic values on the chiral field are
considered. These models are shown to support finite energy solutions with
nonvanishing magnetic and electrix flux, whose energies are bounded from below
by two distinct charges - the magnetic (monopole) charge and a non-integer
version of the Baryon charge. Unit magnetic charge solutions are constructed
numerically and their properties characterised by the chosen asymptotics and
the Skyrme coupling are studied. For a particular value of the chosen
asymptotics, charge-2 axially symmetric solutions are also constructed and the
attractive nature of the like-monopoles of this system are exhibited. As an
indication towards the possible existence of large clumps of monopoles, some
consideration is given to axially symmetric monopoles of charges-2,3,4.
