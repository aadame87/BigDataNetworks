  Four-dimensional Einstein gravity in the Palatini first order formalism is
shown to possess a vector supersymmetry of the same type as found in the
topological theories for Yang-Mills fields. A peculiar feature of the
gravitational theory, characterized by diffeomorphism invariance, is a direct
link of vector supersymmetry with the field equation of motion for the
Faddeev-Popov ghost of diffeomorphisms.
