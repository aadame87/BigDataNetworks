Title: Current correlators in the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM
Authors: Andreas Brandhuber, Konstadinos Sfetsos
Comments: LaTeX2e, 26 pages; v2: detailed explanations on the decoupling of
  scalars and gauge field fluctuations added, references; v5: in an addendum
  (in collaboration with D. Freedman and K. Skenderis) we demonstrate that the
  zero-mass poles found in the supergravity calculation are in agreement with
  field theory, thus resolving a puzzle in earlier versions of the paper

  We study correlators of R-symmetry currents in the Coulomb branch of N = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory in the large-N limit, using the AdS/CFT
correspondence. In particular, we consider gauge fields in the presence of
gravity and scalar fields parameterizing the coset SL(6,R)/SO(6) in the context
of five-dimensional gauged supergravity. From a ten-dimensional point of view
these backgrounds correspond to continuous D3-brane distributions. We find the
surprising result that all 2-point functions of gauge currents fall into the
same universality class, irrespectively of whether they correspond to broken or
unbroken symmetries. We show that the problem of finding the spectrum can be
mapped into an equivalent Schroedinger problem for supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. The corresponding potential is the supersymmetric partner of the
potential arising in studies of the spectrum for massless scalars and
transverse graviton fluctuations in these backgrounds and the associated
spectra are also identical. We discuss in detail two examples where these
computations can be done explicitly as in the conformal case.
