  Using Kaluza-Klein technique we show that the singularity of Hawking-Turok
type has a fixed point (bolt) contribution to the action in addition to the
usual boundary contribution. Interestingly by adding this contribution we can
obtain a simple expression for the total action which is feasible for both
regular and singular instantons. Our result casts doubt on the constraint
proposed by Turok in the recent calculation in which Vilenkin's instantons are
regarded as a limit of certain constrained instantons.
