  In this paper we consider some constraints on brane-world cosmologies. In the
first part we analyze different behaviors for the expansion of our universe by
imposing constraints on the speed of sound. In the second part, we study the
nature of matter on the brane world by means of the well-known energy
conditions. We find that the strong energy condition must be completely
violated at late stages of the universe.
