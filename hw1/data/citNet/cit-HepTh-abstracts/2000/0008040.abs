  In this paper I shall discuss the way in which vacuum structure and
condensates occur in the light-cone representation. I shall particularly
emphasize the mechanism by which the mass squared of a composite such as the
pion comes to depend linearly on the bare mass of its Fermion constituents. I
shall give details in two dimensions then discuss the case of four dimensions
more speculatively.
