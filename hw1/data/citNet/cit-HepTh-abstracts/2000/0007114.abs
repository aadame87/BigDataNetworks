  We construct a q-deformed version of the conformal quantum mechanics model of
de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan for which the deformation parameter is complex and
the unitary time evolution of the system is preserved. We also study
differential calculus on the q-deformed quantum phase space associated with
such system.
