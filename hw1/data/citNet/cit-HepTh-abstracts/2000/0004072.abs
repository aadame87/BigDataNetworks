  We show that the existent fuzzy S^2 and S^4 models are natural candidates for
the quantum geometry on the corresponding spheres in AdS/CFT correspondence.
These models fit nicely the data from the dipole mechanism for the stringy
exclusion principle. In the AdS_2 X S^2 case, we show that a wrapped fractional
membrane can be used to count for the large ground state degeneracy. We also
propose a fuzzy AdS_2 model whose fundamental commutation relation may underlie
the UV/IR connection.
