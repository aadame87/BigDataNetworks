  equation

  Following the recent paper by J. F. van Diejen and H. Puschmann we
investigate the behavior of zeros of the finite-gap solutions to the
Schrodinger equation. As a result, a new system of particles on a punctured
Riemann surface is constructed. It is shown to be Hamiltonian and integrable.
