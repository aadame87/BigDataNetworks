  Some aspects of the $D=6, (2,0)$ tensor multiplet are discussed. Its
formulation as an analytic superfield on a suitably defined superspace and its
superconformal properties are reviewed. Powers of the field strength superfield
define a series of superconformal fields which correspond to the KK multiplets
of D=11 supergravity on an $AdS_7\xz S^4$ background. Correlation functions of
these operators are briefly discussed.
