  After reviewing the Green-Schwarz superstring using the approach of Siegel,
the superstring is covariantly quantized by constructing a BRST operator from
the fermionic constraints and a bosonic pure spinor ghost variable. Physical
massless vertex operators are constructed and, for the first time, N-point tree
amplitudes are computed in a manifestly ten-dimensional super-Poincar\'e
covariant manner. Quantization can be generalized to curved supergravity
backgrounds and the vertex operator for fluctuations around $AdS_5\times S^5$
is explicitly constructed. This review is written in a self-contained manner
and is based on talks given at the Fradkin Memorial Conference and Strings
2000.
