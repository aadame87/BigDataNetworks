  We derive constraints on the non-perturbative 3-point fermion-boson
transverse vertex in massless QED3 from its perturbative calculation to order
$\alpha$. We also check the transversality condition to two loops and evaluate
the fermion propagator to the same order. We compare a conjecture of the
non-perturbative vertex by Burden and Tjiang against our results and comment on
its draw backs. Our calculation calls for the need to construct a
non-perturbative form for the fermion-boson vertex which agrees with its
perturbative limit to ${\cal O}(\alpha)$.
