  It has been recently shown that F-theory on K3 with background B fields (NSNS
and RR 2-forms) is dual to the CHL string in 8 dimensions. In this paper, we
reexamine this duality in terms of string junctions in type IIB string theory.
It is in particular stressed that certain 7-brane configurations produce Sp
gauge groups in a novel way.
