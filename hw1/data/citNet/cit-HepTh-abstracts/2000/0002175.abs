  We describe a mechanism for localising branes in ambient space. When a 3-form
flux is turned on in a Taub-NUT space, an M5-brane gets an effective potential
that pins it to the center of the space. A similar effect occurs for M2-branes
and D-branes with appropriate fluxes. In carefully chosen limits of the
external parameters, this leads to new theories that are decoupled from gravity
and appear to break Lorentz invariance. For example, we predict the existence
of a new 5+1D theory that breaks Lorentz invariance at high-energy and has a
low-energy description of N tensor multiplets with (1,0) supersymmetry. We also
predict a new type of theory that, similarly to the little-string theory
decouples from gravity by a dynamical (rather than kinematical) argument.
