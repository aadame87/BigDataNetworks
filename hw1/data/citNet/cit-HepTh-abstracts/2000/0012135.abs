  A primary goal in holographic theories of gravity is to study the causal
structure of spacetime from the field theory point of view. This is a
particularly difficult problem when the spacetime has a non-trivial causal
structure, such as a black hole. We attempt to study causality through the
UV/IR relation between field theory and spacetime quantities, which encodes
information about bulk position. We study the UV/IR relations for charged black
hole spacetimes in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We find that the UV/IR relations
have a number of interesting features, but find little information about the
presence of a horizon in the bulk. The scale of Wilson loops is simply related
to radial position, whether there is a horizon or not. For time-dependent
probes, the part of the history near the horizon only effects the late-time
behaviour of field theory observables. Static supergravity probes have a finite
scale size related to radial position in generic black holes, but there is an
interesting logarithmic divergence as the temperature approaches zero.
