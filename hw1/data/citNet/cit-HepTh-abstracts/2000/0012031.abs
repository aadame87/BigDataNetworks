  We present a numerical study of the fermion-induced effective action in the
presence of a static inhomogeneous magnetic field for both 3+1 and 2+1
dimensional QED using a novel approach. This approach is appropriate for
cylindrically symmetric magnetic fields with finite magnetic flux $\Phi$. We
consider families of magnetic fields, dependent on two parameters, a typical
value $B_{m}$ for the field and a typical range d. We investigate the behavior
of the effective action for three distinct cases: 1) keeping $\Phi$ (or
$B_{m}d^{2}$) constant and varying d, 2) keeping $B_{m}$ constant and varying d
and 3) keeping d constant and varying $\Phi$ (or $B_{m}d^{2}$). We note an
interesting difference as d tends to infinity (case 2) between smooth and
discontinuous magnetic fields. In the strong field limit (case 3) we also
derive an explicit asymptotic formula for the 3+1 dimensional action. We study
the stability of the magnetic field and we show that magnetic fields of the
type we examine remain unstable, even in the presence of the fermions. In the
appropriate regions we check our numerical results against the Schwinger
formula (constant magnetic field), the derivative expansion and the numerical
work of M. Bordag and K. Kirsten. The role of the Landau levels for the
effective action, and the appearance of metastable states for large magnetic
flux, are discussed in an appendix.
