  We supplement the discussion on localization of gravity on dilatonic domain
walls in ``Solitons in Brane Worlds'' (Nucl. Phys. B576, 106, hep-th/9911218)
by giving unified and coherent discussion which combines the result of this
paper and the expanded results in the author's subsequent papers in an attempt
to avoid misleading readers. We also discuss the possible string theory
embeddings of the Randall-Sundrum type brane world scenarios through
non-dilatonic and dilatonic domain walls, which straightforwardly follows from
the author's previous works but was not elaborated explicitly.
