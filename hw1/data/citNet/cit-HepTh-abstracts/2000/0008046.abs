  I construct a map from the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves to
$K$-homology. This results in explicit realizations of $K$-homology cycles
associated with D-brane configurations. Non-Abelian degrees of freedom arise in
this framework from the deformation quantization of $N$-tuple cycles. The large
$N$ limit of the gauge theory on D-branes wrapped on a subvariety $V$ of some
variety $X$ is geometrically interpreted as the deformation quantization of the
formal completion of $X$ along $V.$
