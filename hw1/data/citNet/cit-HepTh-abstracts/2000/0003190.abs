  This document is an introduction to and review of two-dimensional
mathematical physics. The reader is introduced to the subject matter primarily
through problems, which are presented along with detailed worked solutions. For
each chapter, there is a brief summary of important results and ideas that
precedes the problems and the solutions. This document can be worked through
independently by one wishing to learn this subject; alternatively, this could
serve as a companion to a more conventional review article or textbook on the
subject.
  The current release contains Part I, and includes six chapters:
  1. Curiosities In 2 Dimensions 2. General Principles Of Conformal Field
Theory 3. Correlators In Critical Models 4. Other Models In Conformal Field
Theory 5. Construction Of New Models 6. Modular Invariance
