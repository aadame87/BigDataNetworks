  The dual supergravity description of the flow between (2,0) five-brane theory
and the noncommutative five-brane (OM) theory is examined at critical
five-brane field strength. The self-duality of the field strength is shown to
arise as a consequence of the supergravity solution. Open membrane solutions
are examined in the background of the five-brane giving rise to an M analogue
of the noncommutative open string (NCOS) solution.
