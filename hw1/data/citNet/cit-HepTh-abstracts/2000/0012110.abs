  We review the construction of actions with supersymmetry on spaces with a
domain wall. The latter objects act as sources inducing a jump in the gauge
coupling constant. Despite these singularities, supersymmetry can be
formulated, maintaining its role as a square root of translations in this
singular space. The setup is designed for the application in five dimensions
related to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario. The space has two domain walls.
We discuss the solutions of the theory with fixed scalars and full preserved
supersymmetry, in which case one of the branes can be pushed to infinity, and
solutions where half of the supersymmetries are preserved.
