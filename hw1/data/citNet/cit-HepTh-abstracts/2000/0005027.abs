  Sklyanin's method of separation of variables is employed in a calculation of
finite temperature expectation values. An essential element of the approach is
Baxter's $Q$-function. We propose its explicit form corresponding to the ground
state of the sinh-Gordon theory. With the method of separation of variables we
calculate the finite temperature expectation values of the exponential fields
to one-loop order of the semi-classical expansion.
