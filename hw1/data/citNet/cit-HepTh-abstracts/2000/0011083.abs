  The blocked composite operators are defined in the one-component Euclidean
scalar field theory, and shown to generate a linear transformation of the
operators, the operator mixing. This transformation allows us to introduce the
parallel transport of the operators along the RG trajectory. The connection on
this one-dimensional manifold governs the scale evolution of the operator
mixing. It is shown that the solution of the eigenvalue problem of the
connection gives the various scaling regimes and the relevant operators there.
The relation to perturbative renormalization is also discussed in the framework
of the $\phi^3$ theory in dimension $d=6$.
