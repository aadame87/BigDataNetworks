  We consider the compactification M(atrix) theory on a Riemann surface Sigma
of genus g>1. A natural generalization of the case of the torus leads to
construct a projective unitary representation of pi_1(\Sigma), realized on the
Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the upper half--plane. A
uniquely determined gauge connection, which in turn defines a gauged sl_2(R)
algebra, provides the central extension. This has a geometric interpretation as
the gauge length of a geodesic triangle, and corresponds to a 2-cocycle of the
2nd Hochschild cohomology group of the Fuchsian group uniformizing Sigma. Our
construction can be seen as a suitable double-scaling limit N\to\infty,
k\to-\infty of a U(N) representation of pi_1(Sigma), where k is the degree of
the associated holomorphic vector bundle, which can be seen as the higher-genus
analog of 't Hooft's clock and shift matrices of QCD. We compare the above
mentioned uniqueness of the connection with the one considered in the
differential-geometric approach to the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem provided by
Donaldson. We then use our infinite dimensional representation to construct a
C^\star-algebra which can be interpreted as a noncommutative Riemann surface
Sigma_\theta. Finally, we comment on the extension to higher genus of the
concept of Morita equivalence.
