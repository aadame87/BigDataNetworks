  commutative geometry

  The non commutative geometry is a possible framework to regularize Quantum
Field Theory in a nonperturbative way. This idea is an extension of the lattice
approximation by non commutativity that allows to preserve symmetries. The
supersymmetric version is also studied and more precisely in the case of the
Schwinger model on supersphere [14]. This paper is a generalization of this
latter work to more general gauge groups.
