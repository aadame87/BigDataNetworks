  Complete results were obtained by us in [Can. J. Phys. 71, 389 (1993)] for
convergent series representations of both the real and the imaginary part of
the QED effective action; these derivations were based on correct intermediate
steps. In this comment, we argue that the physical significance of the
"logarithmic correction term" found by Cho and Pak in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86,
1947 (2001)] in comparison to the usual expression for the QED effective action
remains to be demonstrated.
