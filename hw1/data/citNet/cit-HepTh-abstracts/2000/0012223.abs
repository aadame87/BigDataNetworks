  We consider the massive tricritical Ising model M(4,5) perturbed by the
thermal operator phi_{1,3} in a cylindrical geometry and apply integrable
boundary conditions, labelled by the Kac labels (r,s), that are natural
off-critical perturbations of known conformal boundary conditions. We derive
massive thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations for all excitations by
solving, in the continuum scaling limit, the TBA functional equation satisfied
by the double-row transfer matrices of the A_4 lattice model of Andrews, Baxter
and Forrester (ABF) in Regime III. The complete classification of excitations,
in terms of (m,n) systems, is precisely the same as at the conformal
tricritical point. Our methods also apply on a torus but we first consider
(r,s) boundaries on the cylinder because the classification of states is simply
related to fermionic representations of single Virasoro characters
chi_{r,s}(q). We study the TBA equations analytically and numerically to
determine the conformal UV and free particle IR spectra and the connecting
massive flows. The TBA equations in Regime IV and massless RG flows are studied
in Part II.
