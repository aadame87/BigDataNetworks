  We discuss the compactification of type I strings on a torus with additional
background gauge flux on the D9-branes. The solutions to the cancellation of
the RR tadpoles display various phenomenologically attractive features:
supersymmetry breaking, chiral fermions and the opportunity to reduce the rank
of the gauge group as desired. We also point out the equivalence of the concept
of various different background fields and noncommutative deformations of the
geometry on the individual D9-branes by constructing the relevant boundary
states to describe such objects.
