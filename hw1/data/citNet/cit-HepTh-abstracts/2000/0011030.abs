  In the early Universe matter can be described as a conformal invariant
ultra-relativistic perfect fluid, which does not contribute, on classical
level, to the evolution of the isotropic and homogeneous metric. If we suppose
that there is some desert in the particle spectrum just below the Planck mass,
then the effect of conformal trace anomaly is dominating at the corresponding
energies. With some additional constraints on the particle content of the
underlying gauge model (which favor extended or supersymmetric versions of the
Standard Model rather than the minimal one), one arrives at the stable
inflation. We review the model and report about the calculation of the
gravitational waves on the background of the anomaly-induced inflation. The
result for the perturbation spectrum is close to the one for the conventional
inflaton model, and is in agreement with the existing Cobe data (see also
[hep-th/0009197]).
