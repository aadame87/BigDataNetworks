  A comparison is made between the thermodynamics of weakly and strongly
coupled Yang-Mills with fixed angular momentum. The free energy of the strongly
coupled Yang-Mills is calculated by using a dual supergravity description
corresponding to a rotating black hole in an Anti de Sitter (AdS) background.
All thermodynamic quantities are shown have the same ratio of 3/4 (independent
of angular momentum) between strong and weak coupling.
