  I study a class of interacting conformal field theories and conformal windows
in three dimensions, formulated using the Parisi large-N approach and a
modified dimensional-regularization technique. Bosons are associated with
composite operators and their propagators are dynamically generated by fermion
bubbles. Renormalization-group flows between pairs of interacting fixed points
satisfy a set of non-perturbative g <-> 1/g dualities. There is an exact
relation between the beta function and the anomalous dimension of the composite
boson. Non-Abelian gauge fields have a non-renormalized and quantized gauge
coupling, although no Chern-Simons term is present. A problem of the naive
dimensional-regularization technique for these theories is uncovered and
removed with a non-local, evanescent, non-renormalized kinetic term. The models
are expected to be a fruitful arena for the study of odd-dimensional conformal
field theory.
