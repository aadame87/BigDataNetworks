  An example of the holographic correspondence between 2d, N=2 quantum field
theories and classical 4d, N=2 supergravity theories is found. The constraints
on the target space geometry of the 4d, N=2 non-linear sigma-models in N=2
supergravity background are interpreted as the renormalization flow equations
in two dimensions. Our geometrical description of the renormalization flow is
manifestly covariant under reparametrization of the 2d coupling constants. The
proposed holography is described in terms of the (Weyl) anti-self-dual Einstein
metrics, whose exact regular (Tod-Hitchin) solutions are governed by the
Painleve VI equation.
