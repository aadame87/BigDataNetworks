  We study the gauge transformation of the recently computed one-loop
four-point function of {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge
group U(N). The contributions from nonplanar diagrams are not gauge invariant.
We compute their gauge variation and show that it is cancelled by the variation
from corresponding terms of the one-loop five-point function. This mechanism is
general: it insures the gauge invariance of the noncommutative one-loop
effective action.
