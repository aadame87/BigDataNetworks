  The conformal affine Toda model coupled to the matter field (CATM) is
obtained through a classical reduction of the $sl(2)^{(1)}$ affine two-loop
WZNW model. After spontaneously broken the conformal symmetry by means of BRST
analysis, we end up with an effective theory, the so called affine Toda model
coupled to the matter (ATM). Further, using a bosonization technique we recover
from this theory the sine-Gordon model plus a free massless scalar field. The
ATM model is considered as a QCD-motivated integrable field theory, since it
describes various features in the baryonic sector of the low-energy effective
Lagrangian of QCD in two dimensions with one flavor and two colors. Imposing
the equivalence of the Noether and topological currrents as a constraint, it is
shown that the intercharge ``quark''- ``anti-quark'' static potential reveals a
linear confinement behavior for large intercharge separation.
