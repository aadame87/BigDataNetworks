  Based on the DBI action for the four coincident non-BPS D9-branes in the type
IIA string theory we demonstrate that the gauge symmetry breaking through the
tachyon condensation into the generalized monopole of codimension five produces
a pair of two coincident BPS D4-branes. The nontrivial gauge field
configuration is studied and shown to yield the non-zero generalized magnetic
charge. We discuss how this explicit demonstration is related with the higher
K-theory group.
