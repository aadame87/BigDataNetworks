  We study the ultraviolet asymptotics in non-simply laced affine Toda theories
considering them as perturbed non-affine Toda theories, which possess the
extended conformal symmetry. We calculate the reflection amplitudes, in
non-affine Toda theories and use them to derive the quantization condition for
the vacuum wave function, describing zero-mode dynamics. The solution of this
quantization conditions for the ground state energy determines the UV
asymptotics of the effective central charge. These asymptotics are in a good
agreement with Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz(TBA) results. To make the comparison
with TBA possible, we give the exact relations between parameters of the action
and masses of particles as well as the bulk free energies for non-simply laced
affine Toda theories.
