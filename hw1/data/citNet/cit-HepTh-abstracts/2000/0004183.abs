  The multiloop amplitudes for the bosonic string in presence of a constant
B-field are built by using the basic commutation relations for the open string
zero modes and oscillators. The open string Green function on the annulus is
obtained from the one loop scattering amplitude among N tachyons. For higher
loops, it is necessary to use the so called three Reggeon vertex, which
describes the emission from the open string of another string and not simply of
a tachyon. We find that the modifications to the three (and multi) Reggeon
vertex due to the B-field only affect the zero modes and can be written in a
simple and elegant way. Therefore we can easily sew these vertices together and
write the general expression for the multiloop N-Reggeon vertex, which contains
any loop string amplitude, in presence of the B-field. The field theory limit
is also considered in some examples at two loops and reproduces exactly the
results of a noncommutative scalar field theory.
