  We consider the first subleading terms in the low-energy cross section for
the absorption of dilaton partial waves by D3-branes. We demonstrate that these
corrections, computed previously via supergravity, can be reproduced exactly in
a worldvolume calculation using a deformation of N=4 SYM theory by a dimension
eight chiral operator. The calculation does not depend on how the theory is
regularized. This result provides another hint that holographic duality between
the D3-brane worldvolume theory and the corresponding supergravity solution may
be valid beyond the near horizon limit.
