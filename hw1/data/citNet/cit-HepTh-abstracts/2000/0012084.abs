  A relation between the Schroedinger wave functional and the Clifford-valued
wave function which appears in what we call precanonical quantization of fields
and fulfills a Dirac-like generalized covariant Schroedinger equation on the
space of field and space-time variables is discussed. The Schroedinger wave
functional is argued to be the trace of the positive frequency part of the
continual product over all spatial points of the values of the aforementioned
wave function restricted to a Cauchy surface. The standard functional
differential Schroedinger equation is derived as a consequence of the
Dirac-like covariant Schroedinger equation.
