  We analyse in three space-time dimensions, the connection between abelian
self dual vector doublets and their counterparts containing both an explicit
mass and a topological mass. Their correspondence is established in the
lagrangian formalism using an operator approach as well as a path integral
approach. A canonical hamiltonian analysis is presented, which also shows the
equivalence with the lagrangian formalism. The implications of our results for
bosonisation in three dimensions are discussed.
