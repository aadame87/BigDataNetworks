  Within the spirit of five-dimensional gravity in the Randall-Sundrum
scenario, in this paper we consider cosmological and gravitational implications
induced by forcing the spacetime metric to satisfy a Misner-like symmetry. We
first show that in the resulting Misner-brane framework the Friedmann metric
for a radiation dominated flat universe and the Schwarzschild or anti-de Sitter
black holes metrics are exact solutions on the branes, but the model cannot
accommodate any inflationary solution. The horizon and flatness problems can
however be solved in Misner-brane cosmology by causal and noncausal
communications through the extra dimension between distant regions which are
outside the horizon. Based on a semiclassical approximation to the
path-integral approach, we have calculated the quantum state of the
Misner-brane universe and the quantum perturbations induced on its metric by
brane propagation along the fifth direction. We have then considered testable
predictions from our model. These include a scale-invariant spectrum of density
perturbations whose amplitude can be naturally accommodated to the required
value 10$^{-5}-10^{-6}$, and a power spectrum of CMB anisotropies whose
acoustic peaks are at the same sky angles as those predicted by inflationary
models, but having much smaller secondary-peak intensities. These predictions
seem to be compatible with COBE and recent Boomerang and Maxima measurements
