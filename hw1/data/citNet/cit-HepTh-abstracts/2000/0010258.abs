  Recent work has proposed the principle of `asymptotic past triviality' to
characterize the initial state in the pre-big bang scenario of string
cosmology, that it is a generic perturbative solution of the low-energy
effective action. Among the more generic sets of solutions which is simple
enough to investigate thoroughly, yet complex enough to exhibit interesting
behavior, is the gravity-dilaton system in spherical symmetry. Since, in the
Einstein frame, this system reduces to a massless minimally coupled scalar,
which has been target of a large body of previous investigation, we will draw
on this and interpret it in the cosmological context. Since this scenario
necessarily involves the transition from weak field initial data into the
strong field regime, gravitational collapse, we have made numerical
computations to answer some of the questions raised on the road to the proposal
that `the pre-big bang is as generic as gravitational collapse'.
