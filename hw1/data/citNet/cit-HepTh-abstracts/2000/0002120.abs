  We consider holomorphic BF theories, their solutions and symmetries. The
equivalence of Cech and Dolbeault descriptions of holomorphic bundles is used
to develop a method for calculating hidden (nonlocal) symmetries of holomorphic
BF theories. A special cohomological symmetry group and its action on the
solution space are described.
