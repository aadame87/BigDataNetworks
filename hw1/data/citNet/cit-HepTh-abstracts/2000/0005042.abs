Title: Supersymmetry in Singular Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Ashok Das
Comments: Talk presented at the Second School on Field Theory and Gravitation
  in Vitoria, to be published in the proceedings
\\
  The breaking of supersymmetry due to singular potentials in supersymmetric
quantum mechanics is critically analyzed. It is shown that, when properly
regularized, these potentials respect supersymmetry, even when the
regularization parameter is removed.
