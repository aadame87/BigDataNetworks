  We report the issues of localization of various bulk fields on a brane in a
curved background from a local field-theoretic viewpoint where a special
attention is paid to a warp geometry in a general space-time dimension. We
point out that spin 0 scalar field and spin 2 graviton are naturally localized
on a brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor, while spin 1/2 and
3/2 fermionic fields can be localized on the brane by introducing a bulk mass
term with a 'kink' profile. {}For the localization of spin 1 vector field on
the brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor, it is shown that there
are essentially two ways. One way is to appeal to the Dvali-Shifman method
which is based on a peculiar feature of the non-abelian gauge dynamics such as
bulk confinement, whereas the other way is to look for a solution of Einstein
equations in such a way that the geometry has a property of confining the
vector field to the brane by a gravitational interaction as in six dimensions.
We point out that the latter way is more universal.
