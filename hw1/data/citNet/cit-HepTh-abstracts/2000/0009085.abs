Title: Matter Fields in Curved Space-Time
Authors: Nguyen Ai Viet and Kameshwar C. Wali
Comments: 14 pages LaTeX, to appear in AIP proceedings of MRST Conference at
  Rochester NY, May 2000

  We study the geometry of a two-sheeted space-time within the framework of
non-commutative geometry. As a prelude to the Standard Model in curved
space-time, we present a model of a left- and a right- chiral field living on
the two sheeted-space time and construct the action functionals that describe
their interactions.
