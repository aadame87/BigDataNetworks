  We investigate Matrix theory in the large-N limit following the conjectured
correspondence between Matrix theory and supergravity on the near-horizon limit
of the D0-brane background. We analyze the complete fermionic spectrum of
supergravity and obtain two-point functions of the supercurrents in Matrix
theory. By examining the large-N scaling properties of the correlators, we
discuss the consistency of the 11-dimensional interpretation of the
supersymmetry of Matrix theory.
