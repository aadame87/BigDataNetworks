  The one-loop correction to the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein system for the
$\phi^3$ model on $R^{1,d}\times (T_\theta^2)^L$ is evaluated in the high
temperature limit, where the $1+d$ dimensions are the ordinary flat Minkowski
spacetimes and the $L$ extra two-dimensional tori are chosen to be the
noncommutative torus with noncommutativity $\theta$. The corrections to the
Kaluza-Klein mass formula are evaluated and used to compute the Casimir energy
with the help of the Schwinger perturbative formula in the zeta-function
regularization method. The results show that the one-loop Casimir energy is
independent of the radius of torus if L=1. However, when $L>1$ the Casimir
energy could give repulsive force to stabilize the extra noncommutative torus
if $d-L$ is a non-negative even integral. This therefore suggests a possible
stabilization mechanism of extra radius in high temperature, when the extra
spaces are noncommutative.
