Title: Real-normalized Whitham hierarchies and the WDVV equations

  In this paper we present a construction of a new class of explicit solutions
to the WDVV (or associativity) equations. Our construction is based on a
relationship between the WDVV equations and Whitham (or modulation) equations.
Whitham equations appear in the perturbation theory of exact algebro-geometric
solutions of soliton equations and are defined on the moduli space of algebraic
curves with some extra algebro-geometric data. It was first observed by
Krichever that for curves of genus zero the tau-function of a ``universal''
Whitham hierarchy gives a solution to the WDVV equations. This construction was
later extended by Dubrovin and Krichever to algebraic curves of higher genus.
Such extension depends on the choice of a normalization for the corresponding
Whitham differentials. Traditionally only complex normalization (or the
normalization w.r.t. a-cycles) was considered. In this paper we generalize the
above construction to the real-normalized case.
