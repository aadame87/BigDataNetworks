  We construct static axially symmetric black holes in SU(2)
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. Located in between a monopole-antimonopole
pair, these black holes possess magnetic dipole hair. The difference of their
mass and their horizon mass equals the mass of the regular
monopole-antimonopole solution, as expected from the isolated horizon
framework.
