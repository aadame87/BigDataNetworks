  We study five-dimensional gravity models with non-vanishing background scalar
fields which are dual to non-conformal boundary field theories. We develop a
procedure to decouple the graviton fluctuations from the scalar ones and apply
it to the simplest case of one scalar field. The quadratic action for the
decoupled scalar fluctuations has a very simple form and can be used to compute
two-point functions. We perform this computation for the two examples of
background RG flow recently considered by DeWolfe and Freedman and find
physically reasonable results.
