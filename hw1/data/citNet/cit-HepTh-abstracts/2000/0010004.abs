  The particular model of d5 higher derivative gravity which is dual to ${\cal
N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ SCFT is considered. A (perturbative) AdS black hole in such
theory is constructed in the next-to-leading order of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. The surface counterterms are fixed by the conditions required
for a well-defined variational procedure and the finiteness of AdS space (when
the brane goes to infinity). A dynamical brane is realized at the boundary of
an AdS black hole with a radius that is larger than the horizon radius. The
AdS/CFT correspondence dictates the parameters of the gravitational dual in
such a way that the dynamical brane (the observable universe) always occurs
outside the horizon.
