  We embed the large N Chern-Simons/topological string duality in ordinary
superstrings. This corresponds to a large $N$ duality between generalized gauge
systems with N=1 supersymmetry in 4 dimensions and superstrings propagating on
non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds with certain fluxes turned on. We also show
that in a particular limit of the N=1 gauge theory system, certain
superpotential terms in the N=1 system (including deformations if spacetime is
non-commutative) are captured to all orders in 1/N by the amplitudes of
non-critical bosonic strings propagating on a circle with self-dual radius. We
also consider D-brane/anti-D-brane system wrapped over vanishing cycles of
compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and argue that at large $N$ they induce a shift in
the background to a topologically distinct Calabi-Yau, which we identify as the
ground state system of the Brane/anti-Brane system.
