  The form of the vacuum stress-tensor for the quantized scalar field at a
dielectric to vacuum interface is studied. The dielectric is modeled to have an
index of refraction that varies with frequency. We find that the stress-tensor
components, derived from the mode function expansion of the Wightman function,
are naturally regularized by the reflection and transmission coefficients of
the mode at the boundary. Additionally, the divergence of the vacuum energy
associated with a perfectly reflecting mirror is found to disappear for the
dielectric mirror at the expense of introducing a new energy density near the
surface which has the opposite sign. Thus the weak energy condition is always
violated in some region of the spacetime. For the dielectric mirror, the mean
vacuum energy density per unit plate area in a constant time hypersurface is
always found to be positive (or zero) and the averaged weak energy condition is
proven to hold for all observers with non-zero velocity along the normal
direction to the boundary. Both results are found to be generic features of the
vacuum stress-tensor and not necessarily dependent of the frequency dependence
of the dielectric.
