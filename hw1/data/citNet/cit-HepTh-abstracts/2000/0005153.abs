  The D-brane spectrum of a $\Zop_2\times\Zop_2$ Calabi-Yau three-fold orbifold
of toroidally compactified Type IIA and Type IIB string theory is analysed
systematically. The corresponding K-theory groups are determined and complete
agreement is found. New kinds of stable non-BPS D-branes are found, whose
stability regions are far more complicated than the previously discussed
non-BPS D-branes. The decay channels of non-BPS D-branes beyond their stability
regions are identified. Finally the T-dual orbifold is analysed and a suitable
K-theory is found.
