  We consider the parity invariant (2+1)-dimensional QED where the matter is
represented as a mixture of fermions with opposite spins. It is argued that the
perturbative ground state of the system is unstable with respect to the
formation of magnetized ground state. Carrying out the finite temperature
analysis we show that the magnetic instability disappears in the high
temperature regime.
