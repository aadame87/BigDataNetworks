  The confinement scenario in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory at the monopole
point is reviewed. Basic features of this U(1) confinement are contrasted with
those we expect in QCD. In particular, extra states in the hadron spectrum and
non-linear Regge trajectories are discussed. Then another confinement scenario
arising on Higgs branches of the theory with fundamental matter is also
reviewed. Peculiar properties of the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string on the
Higgs branch lead to a new confining regime with the logarithmic suppression of
the linear rising potential. Motivations for a search for tensionless strings
are proposed.
