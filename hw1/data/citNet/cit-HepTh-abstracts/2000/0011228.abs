  We try to give a qualitative description of the Godbillon-Vey class and its
relation on the one hand to the holonomy and on the other hand to the
topological entropy of a foliation, using a remarkable theorem proved recently
by G. Duminy (which still remains unpublished), relating these three notions in
the case of codim-1 foliations. Moreover we shall investigate its possible
consequences on string theory. In particular we shall present a conceptual
argument according to which the curvature of the B-field (rank two
antisymmetric tensor) of open strings might be related to the Godbillon-Vey
class using a suitable generalisation of ``Non-Abelian Geometry'' which has
just appeared in physics literature. Our starting point again is the
Connes-Douglas-Schwarz article on compactifications of matrix models to
noncommutative tori.
