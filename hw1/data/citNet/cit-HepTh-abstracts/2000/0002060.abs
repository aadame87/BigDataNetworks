  The self-duality of chiral p-forms was originally investigated by Pasti,
Sorokin and Tonin in a manifestly Lorentz covariant action with non-polynomial
auxiliary fields. The investigation was then extended to other chiral p-form
actions. In this paper we point out that the self-duality appears in a wider
context of theoretical models that relate to chiral p-forms. We demonstrate
this by considering the interacting model of Floreanini-Jackiw chiral bosons
and gauge fields, the generalized chiral Schwinger model (GCSM) and the
latter's gauge invariant formulation, and discover that the self-duality of the
GCSM corresponds to the vector and axial vector current duality.
