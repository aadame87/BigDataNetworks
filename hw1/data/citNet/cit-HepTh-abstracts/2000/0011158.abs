  We explore a nonlinear realization of the (2+1)-dimensional Lorentz symmetry
with a constant vacuum expectation value of the second rank anti-symmetric
tensor field. By means of the nonlinear realization, we obtain the low-energy
effective action of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons for the spontaneous Lorentz
symmetry breaking.
