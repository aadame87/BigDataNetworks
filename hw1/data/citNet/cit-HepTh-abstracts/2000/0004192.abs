  In this work we initiate a systematic investigation of the spin of a
composite system in an arbitrary reference frame in QCD. After a brief review
of the difficulties one encounters in equal-time quantization, we turn to
light-front quantization. We show that, in spite of the complexities,
light-front field theory offers a unique opportunity to address the issue of
relativistic spin operators in an arbitrary reference frame since boost is
kinematical in this formulation. Utilizing this symmetry, we show how to
introduce transverse spin operators for massless particles in an arbitrary
reference frame in analogy with those for massive particles. Starting from the
manifestly gauge invariant, symmetric energy momentum tensor in QCD, we derive
expressions for the interaction dependent transverse spin operators ${\cal
J}^i$ ($i=1,2$) which are responsible for the helicity flip of the nucleon in
light-front quantization. In order to construct ${\cal J}^i$, first we derive
expressions for the transverse rotation operators $F^i$. In the gauge $A^+=0$,
we eliminate the constrained variables. In the completely gauge fixed sector,
in terms of the dynamical variables, we show that one can decompose ${\cal
J}^i= {\cal J}^i_I + {\cal J}^i_{II} + {\cal J}^i_{III}$ where only ${\cal
J}^i_{I}$ has explicit coordinate ($x^-, x^i$) dependence in its integrand. The
operators ${\cal J}^i_{II}$ and ${\cal J}^i_{III}$ arise from the fermionic and
bosonic parts respectively of the gauge invariant energy momentum tensor. We
discuss the implications of our results.
