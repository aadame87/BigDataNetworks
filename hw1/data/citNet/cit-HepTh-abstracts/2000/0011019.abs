  In the presence of the constant background NS two-form gauge field, we
construct the worldsheet partition functions, bulk propagators and boundary
propagators for the worldsheets with a handle and a boundary. We analyze the
noncommutative $\phi^3$ field theory amplitudes that correspond to the general
two-point insertions on the two-loop nonplanar vacuum bubble. By the direct
string theory amplitude computations on the worldsheets with a handle, which
reduce to the aforementioned field theory amplitudes in the decoupling limit,
we find that the stretched string interpretation remains valid for the types of
amplitudes in consideration. This completes the demonstration that the
stretched string picture holds up in the general multiloop context.
