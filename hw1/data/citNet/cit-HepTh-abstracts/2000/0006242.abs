  We derive a closed expression for the SU(2) Born-Infeld action with the
symmetrized trace for static spherically symmetric purely magnetic
configurations. The lagrangian is obtained in terms of elementary functions.
Using it, we investigate glueball solutions to the flat space NBI theory and
their self-gravitating counterparts. Such solutions, found previously in the
NBI model with the 'square root - ordinary trace' lagrangian, are shown to
persist in the theory with the symmetrized trace lagrangian as well. Although
the symmetrized trace NBI equations differ substantially from those of the
theory with the ordinary trace, a qualitative picture of glueballs remains
essentially the same. Gravity further reduces the difference between solutions
in these two models, and, for sufficiently large values of the effective
gravitational coupling, solutions tends to the same limiting form. The black
holes in the NBI theory with the symmetrized trace are also discussed.
