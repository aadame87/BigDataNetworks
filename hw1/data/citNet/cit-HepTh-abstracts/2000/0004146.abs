  We consider two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model from the viewpoint of the
holography, which has been applied to the study of the Yang-Mills theory, based
on the non-critical string theory. We can see the renormalization group flows
for both the nonlinear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory at the same time,
and the two theories are intimately related through a kind of dual relation of
the coupling constants. We address the running behaviors of these coupling
constants and also the asymptotic freedom of the Yang-Mills theory.
