  We find some exact solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for the
four point correlation functions that occur in the SL(2,R) WZNW model. They
exhibit logarithmic behaviour in both the Kac-Moody and Virasoro parts. We
discuss their implication for the operator product expansion. We also observe
the appearance of several symmetries of the correlation functions.
