  A numerical study of coupled to the dilaton field, static, spherically
symmetric monopole solutions inspired by the Kaluza-Klein theory with large
extra dimensions are presented. The generalized Prasad-Sommerfield solution is
obtained. We show that monopole may have also the dilaton cloud configurations.
