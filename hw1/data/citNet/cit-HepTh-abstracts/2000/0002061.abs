  We derive the action for the non-abelian field theory living on parallel
non-BPS D3-branes in type IIA theory on the orbifold T^4/I_4(-1)^F_L. The
classical moduli space for the massless scalars originating in the ``would be''
tachyonic sector shows an interesting structure. In particular, it contains
non-abelian flat directions. At a generic point in this branch of the moduli
space the scalars corresponding to the the separations of the branes acquire
masses and the branes condense. Although these tree level flat directions are
removed by quantum corrections we argue that within the loop approximation the
branes still condense.
