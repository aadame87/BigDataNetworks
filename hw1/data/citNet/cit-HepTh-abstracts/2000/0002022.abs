  We apply Dirac's Hamiltonian approach to study the canonical structure of the
teleparallel form of general relativity without matter fields. It is shown,
without any gauge fixing, that the Hamiltonian has the generalized Dirac-ADM
form, and constraints satisfy all the consistency requirements. The set of
constraints involves some extra first class constraints, which are used to find
additional gauge symmetries and clarify the gauge structure of the theory.
