  We find explicitly the induced graviton propagator on de Sitter branes
embedded in various five-dimensional spacetimes; de Sitter branes in AdS and
Minkowski space are particular cases. By studying the structure of the
momentum-space propagator, we are able to extract interesting physics, much of
which is qualitatively different from that of flat branes. We find that 1)
there can be a set of graviton-like particles which mediate brane gravity at
different scales; 2) localized gravity can exist even on de Sitter branes in
Minkowski space; 3) Kaluza-Klein modes also contribute to conventional 4-D
gravity for de Sitter branes in AdS; and 4) Newton's constant can vary
considerably with scale. We comment on the implications for the effective
cosmological constant.
