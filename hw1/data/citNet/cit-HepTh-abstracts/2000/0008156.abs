  The standard evaluation of the partition function $Z$ of Schwarz's
topological field theory results in the Ray--Singer analytic torsion. Here we
present an alternative evaluation which results in Z=1. Mathematically, this
amounts to a novel perspective on analytic torsion: it can be formally written
as a ratio of volumes of spaces of differential forms which is formally equal
to 1 by Hodge duality. An analogous result for Reidemeister combinatorial
torsion is also obtained.
