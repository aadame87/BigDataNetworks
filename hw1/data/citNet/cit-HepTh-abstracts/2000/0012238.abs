  I propose a general class of space-times whose structure is governed by
observer-independent scales of both velocity ($c$) and length (Planck length),
and I observe that these space-times can naturally host a modification of
FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction such that lengths which in their inertial rest
frame are bigger than a "minimum length" are also bigger than the minimum
length in all other inertial frames. With an analysis in leading order in the
minimum length, I show that this is the case in a specific illustrative example
of postulates for Relativity with velocity and length observer-independent
scales.
