  In Randall-Sundrum-type brane-world cosmologies, the dynamical equations on
the three-brane differ from the general relativity equations by terms that
carry the effects of imbedding and of the free gravitational field in the
five-dimensional bulk. We derive the covariant nonlinear dynamical equations
for the gravitational and matter fields on the brane, and then linearize to
find the perturbation equations on the brane. The local energy-momentum
corrections are significant only at very high energies. The imprint on the
brane of the nonlocal gravitational field in the bulk is more subtle, and we
provide a careful decomposition of this effect into nonlocal energy density,
flux and anisotropic stress. The nonlocal energy density determines the tidal
acceleration in the off-brane direction, and can oppose singularity formation
via the generalized Raychaudhuri equation. Unlike the nonlocal energy density
and flux, the nonlocal anisotropic stress is not determined by an evolution
equation on the brane. In particular, isotropy of the cosmic microwave
background may no longer guarantee a Friedmann geometry. Adiabatic density
perturbations are coupled to perturbations in the nonlocal bulk field, and in
general the system is not closed on the brane. But on super-Hubble scales,
density perturbations can be evaluated by brane observers. Tensor perturbations
on the brane are suppressed by local bulk effects during inflation, while the
nonlocal effects can serve as a source or a sink. Vorticity on the brane decays
as in general relativity, but nonlocal bulk effects can source the
gravito-magnetic field, so that vector perturbations can be generated in the
absence of vorticity.
