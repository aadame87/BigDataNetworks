  We prove that both global monopole and minimally coupled static zero mass
scalar field are electrogravity dual of the Schwarzschild solution or flat
space and they share the same equation of state, $T^0_0 - T^i_i = 0$. This
property was however known for the global monopole spacetime while it is for
the first time being established for the scalar field. In particular, it turns
out that the Xanthopoulos - Zannias scalar field solution is dual to flat
space.
