  We show that the world-volume theory on a D-p-brane at the tachyonic vacuum
has solitonic string solutions whose dynamics is governed by the Nambu-Goto
action of a string moving in (25+1) dimensional space-time. This provides
strong evidence for the conjecture that at this vacuum the full (25+1)
dimensional Poincare invariance is restored. We also use this result to argue
that the open string field theory at the tachyonic vacuum must contain closed
string excitations.
