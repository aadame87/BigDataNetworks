  A class of supergravity backgrounds have been proposed as dual descriptions
of strong coupling large-N noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) theories in 3+1
dimensions. However calculations of correlation functions in supergravity from
an evaluation of relevant classical actions appear ambiguous. We propose a
resolution of this ambiguity. Assuming that {\it some} holographic description
exists - regardless of whether it is the NCYM theory - we argue that there
should be operators in the holographic boundary theory which create normalized
states of definite energy and momenta. An operator version of the dual
correspondence then provides a calculation of correlators of these operators in
terms of bulk Green's functions. We show that in the low energy limit the
correlators reproduce expected answers of the ordinary Yang-Mills theory.
