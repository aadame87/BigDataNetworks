  We show that the singular sources in the energy-momentum tensor for the
Randall-Sundrum brane world, viewed as a solution of type IIB supergravity, are
composed of two elements. One of these is a D3-brane source with tension
opposite in sign to the RS tension in five dimensions; the other arises from
patching two regions of flat ten-dimensional spacetime. This resolves an
apparent discrepancy between supersymmetry and the sign and magnitude of the RS
tension.
