  In this highly speculative note we conjecture that it may be possible to
understand features of coincident D-branes, such as the appearance of enhanced
non-abelian gauge symmetry, in a purely geometric fashion, using a form of
geometry known as scheme theory. We give a very brief introduction to some
relevant ideas from scheme theory, and point out how these ideas work in
special cases.
