  In order to understand QCD at the energies relevant to hadronic physics one
requires analytical methods for dealing with relativistic gauge field theories
at large couplings. Strongly coupled quenched QED provides an ideal laboratory
for the development of such techniques, in particular as many calculations
suggest that - like QCD - this theory has a phase with broken chiral symmetry.
In this talk we report on a nonperturbative variational calculation of the
electron propagator within quenched QED and compare results to those obtained
in other approaches. We find surprising differences among these results.
