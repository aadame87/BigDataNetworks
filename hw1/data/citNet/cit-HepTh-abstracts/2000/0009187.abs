  The holographic correspondence between 2d, N=2 quantum field theories and
classical 4d, N=2 supergravity coupled to hypermultiplet matter is proposed.
The geometrical constraints on the target space of the 4d, N=2 non-linear
sigma-models in N=2 supergravity background are interpreted as the exact
renormalization group flow equations in two dimensions. Our geometrical
description of the renormalization flow is manifestly covariant under general
reparametrization of the 2d coupling constants. An explicit exact solution to
the 2d renormalization flow, based on its dual holographic description in terms
of the Zamolodchikov metric, is considered in the particular case of the
four-dimensional NLSM target space described by the SU(2)-invariant (Weyl)
anti-self-dual Einstein metrics. The exact regular (Tod-Hitchin) solutions to
these metrics are governed by the Painlev'e VI equation, and describe domain
walls.
