  Supergravity solutions related to large N SU(N) pure gauge theories with
eight supercharges have recently been shown to give rise to an ``enhancon'', a
new type of hypersurface made of D-branes. We show that enhancons also arise in
similar situations pertaining to SO(2N+1), USp(2N) and SO(2N) gauge theories,
using orientifolds. Enhancons therefore appear to come in types A, B, C, and D.
The latter three differ globally from type A by having an extra Z_2
identification, and are distinguished locally by their subleading behaviour in
large N. We focus mainly on 2+1 dimensional gauge theory, where a relation to
M-theory and the Atiyah-Hitchin and Taub-NUT manifolds enables the construction
of the smooth supergravity solution and the study of some of the 1/N
corrections. The role of the enhancon in eleven dimensional supergravity is
also uncovered. There is a close relation to certain multi-monopole moduli
space problems.
