  We use the partition functions on S^1 x S^n of various conformal field
theories in four and six dimensions in the limit of vanishing coupling to study
the high temperature thermodynamics. Certain modular properties exhibited by
the partition functions help to determine the finite volume corrections, which
play a role in the discussion of entropy bounds.
