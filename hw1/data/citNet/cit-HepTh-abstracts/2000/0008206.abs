  At the component-level we study the `beta-function-favored constraint' (bffc)
formalism, suggested in 1988 as the most natural formulation for supergravity
derived from more fundamental theories. We begin with the suggestion that \bffc
supergravity be identified with new minimal supergravity together with an
additional chiral compensator multiplet. After $U_{\rm A}(1)$symmetry breaking,
the non-propagating axion 2-form of new minimal supergravity becomes the
propagating axion 2-form required by string theory. The final form of the
theory is seen to uniquely allow four simultaneous features: (i) local
supersymmetry, (ii) implementation of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, (iii) a
supersymmetry-breaking order parameter chiral superfield, and (iv) a dilaton
superpotential.
