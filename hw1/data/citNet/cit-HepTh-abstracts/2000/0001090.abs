  It is argued that in certain 2d dilaton gravity theories there exist
self-consistent solutions of field equations with quantum terms which describe
extreme black holes at nonzero temperature. The curvature remains finite on the
horizon due to cancelation of thermal divergencies in the stress-energy tensor
against divergencies in the classical part of field equations. The extreme
black hole solutions under discussion are due to quantum effects only and do
not have classical counterparts.
