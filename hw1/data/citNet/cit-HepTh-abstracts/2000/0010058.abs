  The solution representing a brane-anti-brane system in matrix models breaks
the usual matrix spacetime symmetry. We show that the spacetime symmetry on the
branes is not breaking, rather appears as a combination of the matrix spacetime
transformation and a gauge transformation. As a result, the tachyon field,
itself an off-diagonal entry in longitudinal matrices, transforms nontrivially
under rotations, decomposing into tensors of different ranks. We also show that
the tachyon field can never be gauged away, and conjecture that this field is
related to the usual complex scalar tachyon by a field redefinition. We also
briefly discuss tachyon condensation.
