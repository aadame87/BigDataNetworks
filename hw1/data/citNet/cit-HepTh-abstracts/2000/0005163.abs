  We use dielectric branes to find non singular string theory duals of a
perturbed 2+1 dimensional gauge theory living on D2 branes. By adding fermion
masses we obtain theories with reduced supersymmetry. The Higgs vacua of the
perturbed theory correspond to polarization of the D2 branes into D4 branes.
The confining vacua correspond to polarization of the D2 branes into NS5
branes. We consider different mass perturbations. Adding three equal masses
preserves N=2 supersymmetry. In this case there are no confining vacua. By
adding a fourth fermion mass we break all the supersymmetry, and find confining
vacua. We also obtain duals for domain walls, condensates, baryon vertices,
glueballs and flux tubes. We comment on the Kahler potentials for the Higgs and
confining phases. In the course of the calculations we also find a nontrivial
consistency check of the NS5 brane action in a D2 brane background.
