  5d dilatonic gravity (bosonic sector of gauged supergravity) with non-trivial
bulk potential and with surface terms (boundary cosmological constant and trace
anomaly induced effective action for brane quantum matter) is considered. For
constant bulk potential and maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theory (CFT living on the
brane) the inflationary brane-world is constructed. The bulk is singular
asymptotically AdS space with non-constant dilaton and dilatonic de Sitter or
hyperbolic brane is induced by quantum matter effects. At the same time,
dilaton on the brane is determined dynamically. This all is natural realization
of warped compactification in AdS/CFT correspondence. For fine-tuned toy
example of non-constant bulk potential we found the non-singular dilatonic
brane-world where bulk again represents asymptotically AdS space and de Sitter
brane (inflationary phase of observable Universe) is induced exclusively by
quantum effects. The radius of the brane and dilaton are determined
dynamically. The analytically solvable example of exponential bulk potential
leading to singular asymptotically AdS dilatonic bulk space with de Sitter (or
hyperbolic) brane is also presented.In all cases under discussion the gravity
on the brane is trapped via Randall-Sundrum scenario. It is shown that
qualitatively the same types of brane-worlds occur when quantum brane matter is
described by $N$ dilaton coupled spinors.
