  Noncommutative Version of (Anti-) Self-Dual Yang-Mills Equations

\\
  A noncommutative version of the (anti-) self-dual Yang-Mills equations is
shown to be related via dimensional reductions to noncommutative formulations
of the generalized (SO(3)/SO(2)) nonlinear Schrodinger (NS) equations, of the
super-Korteweg- de Vries (super-KdV) as well as of the matrix KdV equations.
Noncommutative extensions of their linear systems and bicomplexes associated to
conserved quantities are discussed.
