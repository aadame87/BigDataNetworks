  The massive SU(2) gauge field theory coupled with fermions is considered in
2+1 dimensions. Quark energy spectrum and radiative shift in constant external
nonabelian field, being exact solution of the gauge field equations with the
Chern-Simons term, are calculated. Under the condition $m = \theta/4$ the quark
state is shown to be supersymmetric.
