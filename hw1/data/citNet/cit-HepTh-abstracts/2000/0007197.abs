  We investigate the zero mode dimensional reduction of the Kaluza-Klein
unifications in the presence of a single brane in the infinite extra dimension.
We treat the brane as fixed, not a dynamical object, and do not require the
orbifold symmetry. It seems that, contrary to the standard Kaluza-Klein models,
the 4D effective action is no longer invariant under the U(1) gauge
transformations due to the explicit breaking of isometries in the extra
dimension by the brane. Surprisingly, however, the linearized perturbation
analysis around the RS vacuum shows that the Kaluza-Klein gauge field does
possess the U(1) gauge symmetry at the linear level. In addition, the
graviscalar also behaves differently from the 4D point of view. Some physical
implications of our results are also discussed.
