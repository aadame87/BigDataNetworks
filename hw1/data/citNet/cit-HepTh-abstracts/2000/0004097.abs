  We consider brane-world universe where an arbitrary large $N$ quantum CFT is
living on the domain wall. This corresponds to implementing of Randall-Sundrum
compactification within the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. Using anomaly
induced effective action for domain wall CFT the possibility of self-consistent
quantum creation of 4d de Sitter wall Universe (inflation) is demonstrated. In
case of maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theory the exact correspondence with radius
and effective tension found by Hawking-Hertog-Reall is obtained. The hyperbolic
wall Universe may be induced by quantum effects only for exotic matter (higher
derivatives conformal scalar) which has unusual sign of central charge.
