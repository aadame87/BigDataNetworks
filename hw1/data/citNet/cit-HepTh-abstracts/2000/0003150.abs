Title: Nonperturbative approach to a simple model with ultraviolet divergent
  eigenenergies in perturbation theory
Authors: Wen-ge Wang
Comments: 6 pages, no figure
\\
  We study a simple model for which perturbation theory gives ultravioletly
divergent results. We show that when the eigen-solution problem of the
Hamiltonian of the model is treated nonperturbatively, it is possible for
eigenenergies of the Hamiltonian to be finite.
