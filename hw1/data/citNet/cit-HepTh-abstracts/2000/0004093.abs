  We supersymmetrize a class of moduli dependent potentials living on branes
with the help of additional bulk terms in 5d N=2 supergravity. The space of
Poincare invariant vacuum solutions includes the Randall-Sundrum solution and
the $M$-theoretical solution. After adding gauge sectors to the branes we
discuss breakdown of low energy supersymmetry in this setup and hierarchy of
physical scales. In the limit of large warp factors we find decoupling between
effects stemming from different branes in the compactified theory.
