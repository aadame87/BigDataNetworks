  Starting from a solution to the classical Batalin-Vilkovisky master
equation,an extended solution to an extended master equation is constructed by
coupling all the observables, the anomaly candidates and the generators of
global symmetries. The construction of the formalism and its applications in
the context of the renormalization of generic and potentially anomalous gauge
theories are reviewed.
