  We study four-dimensional U(1) on a non-commutative T^2 with rational Theta.
This theory has dual descriptions as ordinary SYM or as NCOS. We identify a set
of massive non-interacting KK states in the SYM theory and track them through
the various dualities. They appear as stretched strings in the non-commutative
U(1) providing another example of the IR/UV mixing in non-commutative field
theories. In the NCOS these states appear as D-strings with winding and
momentum. They form an unconventional type of 1/4 BPS state with the 3-brane.
To obtain a consistent picture of S-duality for compactified theories it is
essential to keep track of both the NS and the RR B-fields.
