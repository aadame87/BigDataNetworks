  We analyse spin and statistics of quantum dyon fields, i.e. fields carrying
both electric and magnetic charge, in 3+1 space-time dimensions. It has been
shown long time ago that, at the quantum mechanical level, a composite dyon
made out of a magnetic pole of charge g and a particle of electric charge e
possesses half-integral spin and fermionic statistics, if the constituents are
bosons and the Dirac quantization condition $eg=2\pi n$ holds, with n odd. This
phenomenon is called spin-statistics transmutation. We show that the same
phenomenon occurs at the quantum field theory level for an elementary dyon.
This analysis requires the construction of gauge invariant charged dyon fields.
Dirac's proposal for such fields, relying on a Coulomb-like photon cloud, leads
to quantum correlators exhibiting an unphysical dependence on the Dirac-string.
Recently Froehlich and Marchetti proposed a recipe for charged dyon fields,
based on a sum over Mandelstam-strings, which overcomes this problem. Using
this recipe we derive explicit expressions for the quantum field theory
correlators and we provide a proof of the occurrence of spin-statistics
transmutation. The proof reduces to a computation of the self-linking numbers
of dyon worldlines and Mandelstam strings, projected on a fixed time
three-space. Dyon composites are also analysed. The transmutation discussed in
this paper bares some analogy with the appearance of anomalous spin and
statistics for particles or vortices in Chern-Simons theories in 2+1
dimensions. However, peculiar features appear in 3+1 dimensions e.g. in the
spin addition rule.
