  In this paper we give a general introduction to supersymmetric spin networks.
Its construction has a direct interpretation in context of the representation
theory of the superalgebra. In particular we analyze a special kind of spin
networks with superalgebra $Osp(1|2n)$. It turns out that the set of
corresponding spin network states forms an orthogonal basis of the Hilbert
space $\cal L\mit^2(\cal A\mit/\cal G)$, and this argument holds even in the
q-deformed case. The $Osp(n|2)$ spin networks are also discussed briefly. We
expect they could provide useful techniques to quantum supergravity and gauge
field theories from the point of non-perturbative view.
