Title: On The BRST Formulation of Diffeomorphism Invariant 4D Quantum Gravity
Author: Ken-ji Hamada (KEK)

  In this note we give some remarks on the BRST formulation of a renormalizable
and diffemorphism invariant 4D quantum gravity recently proposed by the author,
which satisfies the integrability condition by Riegard, Fradkin and Tseytlin at
the 2-loop level. Diffeomorphism invariance requires an addition of the
Wess-Zumino action, from which the Weyl action can be induced by expanding
around a vacuum expectation value of the conformal mode. This fact suggests the
theory has in itself a mechanism to remove extra negative-metric states
dynamically.
