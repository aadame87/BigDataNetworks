  We present a rigorous proof of the convergence theorem for the Feynman graphs
in arbitrary massive Euclidean quantum field theories on non-commutative R^d
(NQFT). We give a detailed classification of divergent graphs in some massive
NQFT and demonstrate the renormalizability of some of these theories.
