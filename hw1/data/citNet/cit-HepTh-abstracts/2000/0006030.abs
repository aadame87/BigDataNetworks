  We discuss the implications of multi-brane constructions involving
combinations of positive and negative tension brane and show how anomalously
light KK states emerge when negative tension ''-'' branes are sandwiched
between ''+'' branes. We present a detailed study of a ''+--+'' brane
assignment which interpolates between two models that have been previously
proposed in which gravity is modified at large scales due to the anomalously
light states. We show that it has the peculiar characteristic that gravity
changes from four dimensional (4D) to 5D at large distances and returns to 4D
at even larger scales. We also consider a crystalline universe which leads to a
similar structure for gravity. The problems associated with intermediate
negative tension branes are discussed and a possible resolution suggested.
