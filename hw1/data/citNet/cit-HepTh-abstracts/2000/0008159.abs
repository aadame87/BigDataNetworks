  We study the conservation laws associated with the asymptotic Poincare
symmetry of spacetime in the general teleparallel theory of gravity. Demanding
that the canonical Poincare generators have well defined functional derivatives
in a properly defined phase space, we obtain the improved form of the
generators, containing certain surface terms. These terms are shown to
represent the values of the related conserved charges: energy-momentum and
angular momentum.
