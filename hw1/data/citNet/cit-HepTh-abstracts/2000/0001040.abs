  A system of generalized coherent states for the de Sitter group obeying
Klein-Gordon equation and corresponding to the massive spin zero particles over
the de Sitter space is considered. This allows us to construct the quantized
scalar field by the resolution over these coherent states; the corresponding
propagator can be computed by the method of analytic continuation to the
complexified de Sitter space and coincides with expressions obtained previously
by other methods. We show that this propagator possess the de Sitter-invariance
and causality properties.
