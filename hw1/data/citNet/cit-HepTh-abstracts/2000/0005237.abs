  In this article we apply the methods outlined in the previous paper of this
series to the particular set of states obtained by choosing the complexifier to
be a Laplace operator for each edge of a graph. The corresponding coherent
state transform was introduced by Hall for one edge and generalized by
Ashtekar, Lewandowski, Marolf, Mour\~ao and Thiemann to arbitrary, finite,
piecewise analytic graphs. However, both of these works were incomplete with
respect to the following two issues : (a) The focus was on the unitarity of the
transform and left the properties of the corresponding coherent states
themselves untouched. (b) While these states depend in some sense on
complexified connections, it remained unclear what the complexification was in
terms of the coordinates of the underlying real phase space. In this paper we
resolve these issues, in particular, we prove that this family of states
satisfies all the usual properties : i) Peakedness in the configuration,
momentum and phase space (or Bargmann-Segal) representation, ii) Saturation of
the unquenched Heisenberg uncertainty bound. iii) (Over)completeness. These
states therefore comprise a candidate family for the semi-classical analysis of
canonical quantum gravity and quantum gauge theory coupled to quantum gravity,
enable error-controlled approximations and set a new starting point for {\it
numerical canonical quantum general relativity and gauge theory}. The text is
supplemented by an appendix which contains extensive graphics in order to give
a feeling for the so far unknown peakedness properties of the states
constructed.
