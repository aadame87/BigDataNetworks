  We study monotonicity and other properties of the canonical c-function
(defined through the correlator of the energy-momentum tensor) in some
holographic duals of 4-d quantum field theories. The canonical c-function and
its derivatives are related to the 5-d Green's function of the dual
supergravity theory. While positivity of the canonical c-function is obvious,
we have not found a general proof of its monotonicity, even though c is
monotonic in the few explicit examples we examine in this paper.
