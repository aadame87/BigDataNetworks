Title: Morita Equivalence and Interpolation of The Dirac-Born-infeld Theory on
  the Non-Commutative Torus
Authors: Pei Wang, Rui-Hong Yue and Kang-Jie Shi
Comments: 6 pages, latex, no figures
\\
  In the noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld action with Chern-Simons term, an
interpolation field $\Phi$ is used in both DBI action and Chern-Simons term.
The Morita equivalence is discussed in both the lagrangian and the Hamiltonian
formalisms, which is more transparent in this treatment.
