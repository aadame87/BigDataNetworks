Title: Pulse interaction in nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics
Authors: A. M. Ignatov, V. P. Poponin
Comments: LaTeX, 5 pages, 2 EPS figures
\\
  The energy-momentum conservation law is used to investigate the interaction
of pulses in the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics with Lorentz-invariant
constitutive relations. It is shown that for the pulses of the arbitrary shape
the interaction results in phase shift only.
