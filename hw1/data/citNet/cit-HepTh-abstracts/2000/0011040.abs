  Various aspects of the four point function for scalar fields in conformally
invariant theories are analysed. This depends on an arbitrary function of two
conformal invariants u,v. A recurrence relation for the function corresponding
to the contribution of an arbitrary spin field in the operator product
expansion to the four point function is derived. This is solved explicitly in
two and four dimensions in terms of ordinary hypergeometric functions of
variables z,x which are simply related to u,v. The operator product expansion
analysis is applied to the explicit expressions for the four point function
found for free scalar, fermion and vector field theories in four dimensions.
The results for four point functions obtained by using the AdS/CFT
correspondence are also analysed in terms of functions related to those
appearing in the operator product discussion.
