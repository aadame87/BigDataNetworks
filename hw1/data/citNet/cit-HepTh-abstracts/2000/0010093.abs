  We obtain the full 5D graviton propagator in the Randall-Sundrum model with
the Gauss-Bonnet interaction. From the decomposition of the graviton propagator
on the brane, we show that localization of gravity arises in the presence of
the Gauss-Bonnet term. We also obtain the metric perturbation for observers on
the brane with considering the brane bending and compute the amplitude of one
massless graviton exchange. For the positive definite amplitude or no ghost
states, the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient should be negative in our
convention, which is compatible with string amplitude computations. In that
case, the ghost-free condition is sufficient for obtaining the Newtonian
gravity. For a vanishing Gauss-Bonnet coefficient, the brane bending allows us
to reproduce the correct graviton polarizations for the effective 4D Einstein
gravity.
