  Two new families of T-Dual integrable models of dyonic type are constructed.
They represent specific $A_n^{(1)}$ singular Non-Abelian Affine Toda models
having U(1) global symmetry. Their 1-soliton spectrum contains both neutral and
U(1) charged topological solitons sharing the main properties of 4-dimensional
Yang-Mills-Higgs monopoles and dyons. The semiclassical quantization of these
solutions as well as the exact counterterms and the coupling constant
renormalization are studied.
