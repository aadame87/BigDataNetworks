Title: Comments on Instantons on Noncommutative R^4
Authors: Keun-Young Kim, Bum-Hoon Lee, and Hyun Seok Yang
Comments: 15 pages, LaTex. v4: We now obtain the integer instanton number for
  our previous solutions after the correction of a numerical error, consistent
  with http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th?0108007 by Chu, et al. It is also shown
  that the completeness relation is always satisfied, contrary to the claim by
  Chu, et al

  We study U(1) and U(2) instanton solutions on noncommutative R^4 based on the
noncommutative version of ADHM equation proposed by Nekrasov and Schwarz. It is
shown that the anti-self-dual gauge fields on self-dual noncommutative R^4
correctly give integer instanton numbers for all cases we consider. We also
show that the completeness relation in the ADHM construction is generally
satisfied even for noncommutative spaces.
