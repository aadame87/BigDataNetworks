\\
  The functional relation between interquark potential and interquark distance
is explicitly derived by considering the Nambu--Goto action in the $AdS_5
\times S^5$ background. It is also shown that a similar relation holds in a
general background. The implications of this relation for confinement are
briefly discussed.
