  Higher dimensional conformal QFT possesses an interesting braided structure
which, different from the d=1+1 models, is restricted to the timelike region
and therefore easily escapes euclidean action methods. It lies behind the
spectrum of anomalous dimensions which may be viewed as a kind of substitute
for a missing particle interpretation in the presence of interactions.
