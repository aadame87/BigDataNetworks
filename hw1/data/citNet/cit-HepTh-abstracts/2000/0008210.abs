  We analyse the recent controversy on a possible Chern-Simons like term
generated through radiative corrections in QED with a CPT violating term : we
prove that, if the theory is correctly defined through Ward identities and
normalisation conditions, no Chern-Simons term appears, without any ambiguity.
This is related to the fact that such a term is a kind of minor modification of
the gauge fixing term, and then no renormalised. The past year literature on
that subject is discussed, and we insist on the fact that any absence of an
{\sl a priori} divergence should be explained by some symmetry or some
non-renormalisation theorem.
