  We elaborate further on a recently proposed scenario for generating a mass
hierarchy through quantum fluctuations of a single D3 brane, which represents
our world embedded in a bulk five-dimensional space time. In this scenario, the
quantum fluctuations of the D3-brane world in the bulk direction, quantified to
leading order via a `recoil' world-sheet logarithmic conformal field theory
approach, result in the dynamical appearance of a supersymmetry breaking
(obstruction) scale alpha. This may be naturally taken to be at the TeV range,
in order to provide a solution to the conventional gauge-hierarchy problem. The
bulk spatial direction is characterized by the dynamical appearance of an
horizon located at +- 1/alpha, inside which the positive energy conditions for
the existence of stable matter are satisfied. To ensure the correct value of
the four-dimensional Planck mass, the bulk string scale M_s is naturally found
to lie at an intermediate energy scale of 10^{14} GeV. As an exclusive feature
of the D3-brane quantum fluctuations (`recoil') we find that, for any given
M_5, there is a discrete mass spectrum for four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein (KK)
modes of bulk graviton and/or scalar fields. KK modes with masses 0 <= m <
sqrt{2}alpha << M_s are found to have wavefunctions peaked, and hence
localized, on the D3 brane at z=0.
