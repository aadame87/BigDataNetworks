  We extend the well-known method of calculating bulk correlation functions of
the conformal Ising model via bosonisation to situations with boundaries.
Oshikawa and Affleck have found the boundary states of two decoupled Ising
models in terms of the orbifold of a single free boson compactified on a circle
of radius r=1; we adapt their results to include disorder operators. Using
these boundary states we calculate the expectation value of a single disorder
field on a cylinder with free boundary conditions and show that in the
appropriate limits we recover the standard and frustrated partition functions.
We also show how to calculate Ising correlation functions on the upper half
plane.
