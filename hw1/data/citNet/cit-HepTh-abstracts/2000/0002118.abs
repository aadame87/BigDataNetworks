  We study the spatial structure of 1/4 BPS solitons in 4 dimensional N=4 gauge
theory. A weak binding approximation is used where the soliton is made of
several "ingredient" particles. Some spatial moduli are described which are not
accounted for in the (p,q) web picture. These moduli are counted and their
effect on the solutions is demonstrated. The potential for off BPS
configurations is estimated by a simple expression and is found to agree with
previous expressions. We discuss the fermionic zero modes of the solitons, and
find agreement with web predictions.
