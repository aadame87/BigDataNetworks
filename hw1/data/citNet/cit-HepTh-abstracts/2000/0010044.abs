  We propose a new version of the superfield action for a closed D=10, N=1
superstring where the Lorentz harmonics are used as auxiliary superfields. The
incorporation of Lorentz harmonics into the superfield action makes possible to
obtain superfield constraints of the induced worldsheet supergravity as
equations of motion. Moreover, it becomes evident that a so-called 'Wess-Zumino
part' of the superfield action is basically a Lagrangian form of the
generalized action principle. We propose to use the second Noether theorem to
handle the essential terms in the transformation lows of hidden gauge
symmetries, which remove dynamical degrees of freedom from the Lagrange
multiplier superfield.
