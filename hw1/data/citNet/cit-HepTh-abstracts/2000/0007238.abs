  Bekenstein's conjectured entropy bound for a system of linear size R and
energy E, S < 2 pi E R, has counterexamples for many of the ways in which the
``system,'' R, E, and S may be defined. Here new ways are proposed to define
these quantities for arbitrary nongravitational quantum field theories in flat
spacetime, such as defining R as the smallest radius outside of which only
vacuum expectation values occur. Difficulties of extending these definitions to
gravitational quantum theories are noted.
