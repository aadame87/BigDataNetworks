  It has been conjectured that at the stationary point of the tachyon potential
for the non-BPS D-brane or brane-anti-D-brane pair, the negative energy density
cancels the brane tension. We study this conjecture using a cubic superstring
field theory with insertion of a double-step inverse picture changing operator.
We compute the tachyon potential at levels (1/2,1) and (2,6). In the first case
we obtain that the value of the potential at the minimum is 97.5% of the non
BPS D-brane tension. Using a special gauge in the second case we get 105.8% of
the tension.
