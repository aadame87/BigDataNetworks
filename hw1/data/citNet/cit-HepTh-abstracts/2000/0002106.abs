  We explore gauge fields - strings duality by means of the loop equations and
the zigzag symmetry. The results are striking and incomplete. Striking -
because we find that the string ansatz proposed in [A.M. Polyakov,
hep-th/9711002] satisfies gauge theory Schwinger-Dyson equations precisely at
the critical dimension D=4. Incomplete - since we get these results only in the
WKB approximation and only for a special class of contours. The ways to go
beyond these limitations and in particular the OPE for operators defined on the
loop are also discussed.
