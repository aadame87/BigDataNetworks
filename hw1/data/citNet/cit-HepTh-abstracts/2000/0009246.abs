  A recently proposed \ell=\infty field theory model of tachyon dynamics for
unstable bosonic D-branes has been shown to arise as the two-derivative
truncation of (boundary)-string field theory. Using an \ell\to \infty limit
appropriate to stable kinks we obtain a model for the tachyon dynamics on
unstable D-branes or D-brane anti-D-brane pairs of superstring theory. The
tachyon potential is a positive definite even function of the tachyon, and at
the stable global minima there is no on-shell dynamics. The kink solution
mimics nicely the properties of stable D-branes: the spectrum of the kink
consists of infinite levels starting at zero mass, with spacing double the
value of the tachyon mass-squared. It is natural to expect that this model will
arise in (boundary) superstring field theory.
