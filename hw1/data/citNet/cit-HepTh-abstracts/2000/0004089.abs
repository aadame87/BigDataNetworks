  We provide general determinant formulae for all n-particle form factors
related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor and the analogue of the
order and disorder operator in the $SU(3)_2$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model. We
employ the form factors related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor in
the application of the c-theorem and find perfect agreement with the physical
picture recently obtained by means of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. For
finite resonance parameter we recover the expected WZNW-coset central charge
and for infinite resonance parameter the theory decouples into two free
fermions.
