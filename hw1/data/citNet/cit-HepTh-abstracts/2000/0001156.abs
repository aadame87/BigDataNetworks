  The dynamical symmetry breaking in a two-field model is studied by
numerically solving the coupled effective field equations. These are
dissipative equations of motion that can exhibit strong chaotic dynamics. By
choosing very general model parameters leading to symmetry breaking along one
of the field directions, the symmetry broken vacua make the role of transitory
strange attractors and the field trajectories in phase space are strongly
chaotic. Chaos is quantified by means of the determination of the fractal
dimension, which gives an invariant measure for chaotic behavior. Discussions
concerning chaos and dissipation in the model and possible applications to
related problems are given.
