Title: The Reeh-Schlieder property for ground states
Authors: Christian Jaekel
Comments: plain tex, 11 pages, An unnecessary strong assumption has been
  replaced by a more adequate one in Definition 2.1
\\
  Recently it has been shown that the Reeh-Schlieder property w.r.t. thermal
equilibrium states is a direct consequence of locality, additivity and the
relativistic KMS condition. Here we extend this result to ground states.
