  We re-examine the historically important decay of the neutral pion into two
photons. Schwinger's Equivalence Theorem is confirmed. We then consider
radiative corrections to the famous Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly. The result
depends crucially on a physically motivated regularization scheme. Our approach
is largely based on Schwinger's source (dispersion) method.
