\\
  If Bekenstein's conjectured bound on the microcanonical entropy, S < 2 pi E
R, is applied to a closed subsystem of maximal linear size R and excitation
energy up through E, it can be violated by an arbitrarily large factor by a
scalar field having a symmetric potential allowing domain walls, and by the
electromagnetic field modes in a coaxial cable.
