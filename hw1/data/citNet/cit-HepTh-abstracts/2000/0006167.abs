  Quantum groups emerged in the latter quarter of the 20th century as, on the
one hand, a deep and natural generalisation of symmetry groups for certain
integrable systems, and on the other as part of a generalisation of geometry
itself powerful enough to make sense in the quantum domain. Just as the last
century saw the birth of classical geometry, so the present century sees at its
end the birth of this quantum or noncommutative geometry, both as an elegant
mathematical reality and in the form of the first theoretical predictions for
Planck-scale physics via ongoing astronomical measurements. Noncommutativity of
spacetime, in particular, amounts to a postulated new force or physical effect
called cogravity.
