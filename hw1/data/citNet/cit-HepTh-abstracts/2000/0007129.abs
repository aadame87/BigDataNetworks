Title: The N U D problem
Authors: J.S.Dowker
Comments: 9 pages, JyTeX. References and comments added. Calculation corrected

\\
  The hybrid spectral problem where the field satisfies Dirichlet conditions
(D) on part of the boundary of the relevant domain and Neumann (N) on the
remainder is discussed in simple terms. A conjecture for the C_1 coefficient is
presented and the conformal determinant on a 2-disc, where the D and N regions
are semi-circles, is derived. Comments on higher coefficients are made.
