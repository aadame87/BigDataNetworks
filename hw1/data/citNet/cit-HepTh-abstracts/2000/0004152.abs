  A Cantorian fractal spacetime, a family member of von Neumann's
noncommutative geometry is introduced as a geometry underlying a new relativity
theory which is similar to the relation between general relativity and
Riemannian geometry. Based on this model and the new relativity theory an
ensemble distribution of all the dimensions of quantum spacetime is derived
with the help of Fermat grand theorem. The calculated average dimension is very
close to the value of $4+\phi^3 $ (where $\phi$ is the golden mean) obtained by
El Naschie on the basis of a different approach. It is shown that within the
framework of the new relativity the cosmological constant problem is
nonexistent, since the Universe self-organizes and self-tunes according to the
renormalization group (RG) flow with respect to a local scaling microscopic
arrow of time. This implies that the world emerged as a result of a
non-equilibrium process of self-organized critical phenomena launched by vacuum
fluctuations in Cantorian fractal spacetime $\cal E^{\infty}$. It is shown that
we are living in a metastable vacuum and are moving towards a fixed point ($ D$
= 4+$\phi^3$) of the RG. After reaching this point, a new phase transition will
drive the universe to a quasi-crystal phase of the lower average dimension of
$\phi^3$.
