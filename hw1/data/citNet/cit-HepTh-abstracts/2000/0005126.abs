  I discuss the symmetry structure of the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the
Born-Infeld action in four dimensions, and confirm its interpretation as the
Goldstone-Maxwell action associated with partial breaking of N=4 extended
supersymmetry down to N=2, by revealing a hidden invariance of the action with
respect to two non-linearly realized supersymmetries and two spontaneously
broken translations. I also argue about the uniqueness of supersymmetric
extension of the Born-Infeld action, and its possible relation to
noncommutative geometry.
