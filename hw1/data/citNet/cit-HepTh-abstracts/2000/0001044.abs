Title: Tachyon condensation and Boundary States in Bosonic String
Authors: Y. Matsuo
Comments: Proceeding of the talk given at YITP workshop ``Tachyon condensation
  and boundary state''(October 27-29, 1999), latex file
Report-no: UT-838
\\
  We discuss tachyon configuration for the unoriented bosonic string theory
which produces a bosonic string theory with SO(32) gauge symmetry in ten
dimensions. It is closely related to the tachyon condensation scenario proposed
by A. Sen. We also give the boundary state description of the tachyon
condensation process, with some emphasis on the r\^ole of orbifold conformal
field theory.
