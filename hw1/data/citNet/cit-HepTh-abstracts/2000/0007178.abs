  By generalizing the auxiliary field term in the Lagrangian of simplicial
chiral models on a (d-1)-dimensional simplex, the generalized simplicial chiral
models has been introduced in \c{Ali}. These models can be solved analytically
only in d=0 and d=2 cases at large-N limit. In d=0 case, we calculate the
eigenvalue density function in strong regime and show that the partition
function computed from this density function is consistent with one calculated
by path integration directly. In d=2 case, it is shown that all $V= {\rm
Tr}(AA^{\d})^n$ models have a third order phase transition, same as the
2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.
