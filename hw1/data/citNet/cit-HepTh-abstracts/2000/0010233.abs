Title: Seiberg-Witten theory for the asymptotic free rank three tensors of
  SU(N)

  We here give a first indication that there exists a Seiberg-Witten curve for
  SU(N) Seiberg-Witten theory with matter transforming in the totally
antisymmetric rank three tensor representation. We present a derivation of the
leading order hyperelliptic approximation of a curve for this case. Since we
are only interested in the asymptotic free theory we are restricted to
$N=6,7,8$. The derivation is carried out by reversed engineering starting from
the known form of the prepotential at tree level. We also predict the form of
the one instanton correction to the prepotential.
