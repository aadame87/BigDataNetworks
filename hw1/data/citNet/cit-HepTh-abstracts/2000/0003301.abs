  The nonrelativistic interpretation of quantum field theory achieved by
quantization in an infinite momentum frame is spoiled by the inclusion of a
mode of the field carrying p+=0. We therefore explore the viability of doing
without such a mode in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB),
where its presence would seem to be most needed. We show that the physics of
SSB in scalar quantum field theory in 1+1 space-time dimensions is accurately
described without a zero-mode.
