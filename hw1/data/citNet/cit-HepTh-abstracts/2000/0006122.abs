  The non-abelian flat directions in the tachyon potential of stable non-BPS
branes recently found are shown to persist to all orders in alpha' at tree
level in the string coupling. We also obtain the non-abelian Born-Infeld action
including the tachyon potential for a stack of stable non-BPS branes on a
critical orbifold. Finally we discuss stable soliton states on the non-BPS
brane.
