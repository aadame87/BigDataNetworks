  A topological model in three dimensions is proposed. It combines the
Chern-Simons action with a BFK-model which was investigated recently by the
authors of hep-th/9906146. The finiteness of the model to all orders of
perturbation theory is shown in the framework of algebraic renormalization
procedure.
