  Extending recent work on QED and the symmetric phase of the euclidean
multicomponent scalar \phi^4-theory, we construct the vacuum diagrams of the
free energy and the effective energy in the ordered phase of \phi^4-theory. By
regarding them as functionals of the free correlation function and the
interaction vertices, we graphically solve nonlinear functional differential
equations, obtaining loop by loop all connected and one-particle irreducible
vacuum diagrams with their proper weights.
