  We consider the supersymmetric field theories on the noncommutative $R^4$
using the superspace formalism on the commutative space. The terms depending on
the parameter of the noncommutativity $\Theta$ are regarded as the
interactions. In this way we construct the N=1 supersymmetric action for the
U(N) vector multiplets and chiral multiplets of the fundamental,
anti-fundamental and adjoint representations of the gauge group. The action for
vector multiplets of the products gauge group and its bi-fundamental matters is
also obtained. We discuss the problem of the derivative terms of the auxiliary
fields.
