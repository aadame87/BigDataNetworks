  It is known that when there are several D-branes, their space-time
coordinates in general become noncommutative. From the point of view of
noncommutative geometry, it reflects noncommutativity of the world volume of
the D-branes. On the other hand, as we showed in the previous work, in the
presence of the constant antisymmetric tensor field the momentum operators of
the D-branes have noncommutative structure. In the present paper, we
investigate a relation between these noncommutativities and the description of
D-branes in terms of the noncommutative Yang-Mills theory recently proposed by
Seiberg and Witten. It is shown that the noncommutativity of the Yang-Mills
theory, which implies that of the world volume coordinates, originates from
both noncommutativities of the transverse coordinates and momenta from the
viewpoint of the lower-dimensional D-branes. Moreover, we show that this
noncommutativity is transformed by coordinate transformations on the world
volume and thereby can be chosen in an arbitrary fixed value. We also make a
brief comment on a relation between this fact and a hidden symmetry of the IIB
matrix models.
