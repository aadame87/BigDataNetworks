  As a technical exercise with possible relevance to the holographic principle
and string theory, the effective actions (functional determinants) for scalars
and spinors on the squashed three-sphere identified under the action of a
cyclic group, Z_m, are determined. Especially in the extreme oblate squashing
limit, which has a thermodynamic interpretation, the high temperature behaviour
is found as a function of m. Although the intermediate details for odd and even
m are different, the final answers are the same. A thermodynamic interpretation
for spinors is possible only for twisted periodicity conditions and m even.
