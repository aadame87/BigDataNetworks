  In this note we discuss local gauge-invariant operators in noncommutative
gauge theories. Inspired by the connection of these theories with the Matrix
model, we give a simple construction of a complete set of gauge-invariant
operators. We make connection with the recent discussions of candidate
operators which are dual to closed strings modes. We also discuss large Wilson
loops which in the limit of vanishing noncommutativity, reduce to the closed
Wilson loops of the ordinary gauge theory.
