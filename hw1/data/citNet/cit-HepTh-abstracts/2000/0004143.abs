  Classical Maxwell and Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) Electrodynamics in (2+1)D
are studied in some details. General expressions for the potential and fields
are obtained for both models, and some particular cases are explicitly solved.
Conceptual and technical difficulties arise, however, for accelerated charges.
The propagation of electromagnetic signals is also studied and their
reverberation is worked out and discussed. Furthermore, we show that a
Dirac-like monopole yields a (static) tangential electric field. We also
discuss some classical and quantum consequences of the field created by such a
monopole when acting upon an usual electric charge. In particular, we show that
at large distances, the dynamics of one single charged particle under the
action of such a potential and a constant (external) magnetic field as well,
reduces to that of one central harmonic oscillator, presenting, however, an
interesting angular sector which admits energy-eigenvalues. Among other
peculiarities, both sectors, the radial and the angular one, present
non-vanishing energy-eigenvalues for their lowest level. Moreover, those
associated to the angle are shown to respond to discrete shifts of such a
variable. We also raise the question whether the formation of bound states is
possible in the system.
