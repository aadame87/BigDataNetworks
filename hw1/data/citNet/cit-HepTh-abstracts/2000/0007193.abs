Title: Quantum mechanics with non-unitary symmetries
Authors: Bojan Bistrovic
Comments: 47 pages; shortened and clarified, some explanations added

  This article shows that one can consistently incorporate nonunitary
representations of at least one group into the ``ordinary'' nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics. This group turns out to be Lorentz group thus giving us an
alternative approach to QFT for combining the quantum mechanics and special
theory of relativity which keeps the concept of wave function (belonging to
some representation of Lorentz group) through the whole theory. Scalar product
has been redefined to take into the account the nonunitarity of representations
of Lorentz group. Understanding parity symmetry turns out to be the key
ingredient throughout the process. Instead of trying to guess an equation or a
set of equations for some wave functions or fields (or equivalently trying to
guess a Lagrangian for the same), one derives them based only on the
superposition principle and properties of wave functions under Lorentz
transformations and parity. The resulting model has striking similarities with
the standard quantum field theory and yet has no negative energy states, no
zitterbewegung effects, symmetric energy momentum tensor and angular momentum
density tensor for \emph{all} representations of Lorentz group (unifying the
theoretical description of all particles), as well as clear physical
interpretation. It also offers a possible interpretation why particles and
antiparticles have opposite quantum numbers.
