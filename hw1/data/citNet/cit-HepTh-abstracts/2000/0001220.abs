  We discuss the formulation of spin observables associated to a
non-relativistic spinning particles in terms of grassmanian differential
operators. We use as configuration space variables for the pseudo-classical
description of this system the positions $x$ and a Grassmanian vector
$\vec\epsilon$. We consider an explicit discretization procedure to obtain the
quantum amplitudes as path integrals in this superspace. We compute the quantum
action necessary for this description including an explicit expression for the
boundary terms. Finally we shown how for simple examples, the path integral may
be performed in the semi-classical approximation, leading to the correct
quantum propagator.
