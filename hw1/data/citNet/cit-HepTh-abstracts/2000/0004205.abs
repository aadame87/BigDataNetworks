  We examine the relation between Coulomb-gauge fields and the gauge-invariant
fields constructed in the temporal gauge for two-color QCD by comparing a
variety of properties, including their equal-time commutation rules and those
of their conjugate chromoelectric fields. We also express the temporal-gauge
Hamiltonian in terms of gauge-invariant fields and show that it can be
interpreted as a sum of the Coulomb-gauge Hamiltonian and another part that is
important for determining the equations of motion of temporal-gauge fields, but
that can never affect the time evolution of ``physical'' state vectors. We also
discuss multiplicities of gauge-invariant temporal-gauge fields that belong to
different topological sectors and that, in previous work, were shown to be
based on the same underlying gauge-dependent temporal-gauge fields. We argue
that these multiplicities of gauge-invariant fields are manifestations of the
Gribov ambiguity. We show that the differential equation that bases the
multiplicities of gauge-invariant fields on their underlying gauge-dependent
temporal-gauge fields has nonlinearities identical to those of the ``Gribov''
equation, which demonstrates the non-uniqueness of Coulomb-gauge fields. These
multiplicities of gauge-invariant fields --- and, hence, Gribov copies ---
appear in the temporal gauge, but only with the imposition of Gauss's law and
the implementation of gauge invariance; they do not arise when the theory is
represented in terms of gauge-dependent fields and Gauss's law is left
unimplemented.
