  The holographic principle is represented as the well-known de Alfaro, Fubini
and Furlan correspondence between the generating functional for the Green
functions of the Euclidean quantum field theory in $D$ dimensions and the Gibbs
average for the classical statistical mechanics in $D+1$ dimensions. This
correspondence is used to explain the origin of quantum anomalies and the
irreversibility in the classical theory. The holographic mapping of a classical
string field theory onto a local quantum field theory is outlined.
