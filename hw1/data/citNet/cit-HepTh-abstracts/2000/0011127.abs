  We examine the thermodynamic stability of large black holes in
four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, and we demonstrate numerically that
black holes which lack local thermodynamic stability often also lack stability
against small perturbations. This shows that no-hair theorems do not apply in
anti-de Sitter space. A heuristic argument, based on thermodynamics only,
suggests that if there are any violations of Cosmic Censorship in the evolution
of unstable black holes in anti-de Sitter space, they are beyond the reach of a
perturbative analysis.
