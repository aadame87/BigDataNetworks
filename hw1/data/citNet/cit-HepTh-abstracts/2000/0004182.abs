Title: Topological Mass Generation as an Interference Phenomenon

  It is proposed a new mechanism for the phenomenon of topological mass
generation in three spacetime dimensions as the result of the interference of
two opposite massless chiral modes. This mechanism, already used to produce the
massive vectorial mode of the 2D Schwinger model, is here exploited to produce
the gauge invariant massive mode of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Moreover
the procedure is clearly dimensionally independent: a new chiral boson action
is proposed for odd and even dimensional space-times to be used as the basic
building blocks of the interference schemes. This is a new result that extends
the two-dimensional Floreanini-Jackiw action to higher dimensional spaces and
is in clear contrast with the twice odd dimensional chiral form extensions.
