  We study a kaehler potential K in the large radius region of a Calabi-Yau
d-fold M embedded in CP^{d+1}. It has a kaehler parameter t that describes a
deformation of the A-model moduli. Also the metric, curvature and hermitian
two-point functions in the large volume region are analyzed. We use a result of
our previous paper in the B-model of the mirror. We perform an analytic
continuation of a parameter to the large complex structure region. By
translating the result in the A-model side of M, we determine the K. The method
is not restricted to this specific model and we apply the recipe to complete
intersection Calabi-Yau cases.
