Title: Global calculus in BRST cohomology
Authors: G.Giachetta, L.Mangiarotti and G.Sardanashvily
Comments: 15 pages
\\
  The iterated BRST cohomology is studied by computing cohomology of the
variational complex on the infinite order jet space of a smooth fibre bundle.
This computation also provides a solution of the global inverse problem of the
calculus of variations in Lagrangian field theory.
