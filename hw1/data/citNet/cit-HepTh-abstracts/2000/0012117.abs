  We consider string theory on a background of the form AdS_3 x N. Our aim is
to give a description of the dual CFT in a general set up. With the requirement
that we have N=2 supersymmetry in spacetime, we provide evidence that the dual
CFT is in the moduli space of a certain symmetric product M^p/S_p. On the way
to show this, we reproduce some recent results on string propagation on AdS_3
and extend them to the superstring.
