  Noncommutative solitons are easier to find in a noncommutative field theory.
Similarly, the one-loop quantum corrections to the mass of a noncommutative
soliton are easier to compute, in a real scalar theory in 2+1 dimensions. We
carry out this computation in this paper. We also discuss the model with a
double-well potential, and conjecture that there is a partial symmetry
restoration in a vacuum state.
