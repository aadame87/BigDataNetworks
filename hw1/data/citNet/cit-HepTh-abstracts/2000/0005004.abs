  By dimensional reduction of a massive supersymmetric B$\wedge $F theory, a
manifestly N=1 supersymmetric completion of a massive antisymmetric tensor
gauge theory is constructed in (2+1) dimensions. In the N=1-D=3 superspace, a
new topological term is used to give mass for the Kalb-Ramond field. We have
introduced a massive gauge invariant model using the Stuckelberg formalism and
an abelian topologically massive theory for the Kalb-Ramond superfield. An
equivalence of both massive models is suggested. Further, a component field
analysis is performed, showing a second supersymmetry in the model.
