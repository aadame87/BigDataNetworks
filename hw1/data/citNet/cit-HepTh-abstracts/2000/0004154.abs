  A general two dimensional fractional supersymmetric conformal field theory is
investigated. The structure of the symmetries of the theory is studied. Then,
applying the generators of the closed subalgebra generated by $(L_{-1}, L_{0},
G_{-1/3})$ and $(\bar{L}_{-1}, \bar{L}_{0}, \bar{G}_{-1/3})$, the two point
functions of the component fields of supermultiplets are calculated.
