Title: Cliffordons
Authors: David R. Finkelstein and Andrei A. Galiautdinov (Georgia Institute of
  Technology)
Comments: 15 pages, no figures; original title ("Clifford statistics") changed;
  to appear in J. Math. Phys., 42, 2001. Key words: Clifford statistics,
  cliffordons, double-valued representations of permutation groups, spin, swap,
  imaginary unit $i$, applications to quantum space-time and the Standard
  Model. Some of these results were presented at the American Physical Society
  Centennial Meeting, Atlanta, March 25, 1999

  At higher energies the present complex quantum theory with its unitary group
might expand into a real quantum theory with an orthogonal group, broken by an
approximate $i$ operator at lower energies. Implementing this possibility
requires a real quantum double-valued statistics. A Clifford statistics,
representing a swap (12) by a difference $\gamma_1-\gamma_2$ of Clifford units,
is uniquely appropriate. Unlike the Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac,
Bose-Einstein, and para- statistics, which are tensorial and single-valued, and
unlike anyons, which are confined to two dimensions, Clifford statistics are
multivalued and work for any dimensionality. Nayak and Wilczek proposed a
Clifford statistics for the fractional quantum Hall effect. We apply them to
toy quanta here. A complex-Clifford example has the energy spectrum of a system
of spin-1/2 particles in an external magnetic field. This supports the proposal
that the double-valued rotations --- spin --- seen at current energies might
arise from double-valued permutations --- swap --- to be seen at higher
energies. Another toy with real Clifford statistics illustrates how an
effective imaginary unit $i$ can arise naturally within a real quantum theory.
