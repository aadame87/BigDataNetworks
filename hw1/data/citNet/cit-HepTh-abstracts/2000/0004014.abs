  We present a metric solution in six dimensions where gravity is localized on
a four-dimensional singular string-like defect. The corrections to
four-dimensional gravity from the bulk continuum modes are suppressed by ${\cal
O}(1/r^3)$. No tuning of the bulk cosmological constant to the brane tension is
required in order to cancel the four-dimensional cosmological constant.
