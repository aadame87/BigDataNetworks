  In the presence of internal magnetic fields, a D9 brane can acquire a D5 (or
anti-D5) R-R charge, and can therefore contribute to the corresponding tadpole.
In the resulting vacua, supersymmetry is generically broken and tachyonic
instabilities are present. However, suitable choices for the magnetic fields,
corresponding to self-dual configurations in the internal space, can yield new
chiral supersymmetric vacua with gauge groups of reduced rank, where the
magnetic energy saturates, partly or fully, the negative tension of the O5+
planes. These models contain Green-Schwarz couplings to untwisted R-R forms not
present in conventional orientifolds.
