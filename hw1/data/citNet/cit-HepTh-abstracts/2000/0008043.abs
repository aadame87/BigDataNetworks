  We show the equivalence between Stuckelberg and Wess-Zumino methods of
restoration of gauge symmetries of the anomalous, Abelian, effective action, in
arbitrary even dimensions D=2k. We present dual version of Wess-Zumino terms
with the compensating field described by a Kalb-Ramond like p=2k-2 form.
