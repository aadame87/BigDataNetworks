  We construct new exact BPS solitons in various noncommutative gauge theories
by the ``gauge'' transformation of known BPS solitons. This ``gauge''
transformation introduced by Harvey, Kraus and Larsen adds localized solitons
to the known soliton. These solitons include, for example, the bound state of a
noncommutative Abelian monopole and N fluxons at threshold. This corresponds,
in superstring theories, to a D-string which attaches to a D3-brane and N
D-strings which pierce the D3-brane, where all D-strings are parallel to each
other.
