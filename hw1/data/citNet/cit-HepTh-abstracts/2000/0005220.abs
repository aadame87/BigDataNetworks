  We discuss a general pairing that occurs in compactifications of M-theory on
AdS_4 x X^7 backgrounds between massless ultra short multiplets and their
massive shadows, namely certain universal long multiplets with fixed protected
dimensions. In particular we consider the shadow of the short graviton
multiplet in N=3 compactifications. It turns out to be a massive spin 3/2
multiplet with scale dimension E_0=3 and with the quantum numbers of a
super-Higgs multiplet. Hence each N=3 AdS_4 x X^7 vacuum is actually to be
interpreted as a spontaneously broken phase of an N=4 theory. Comparison with
standard gauged N=4 supergravity in 4 dimensions reveals the unexpected bound
E_0<3 on the dimension of the broken gravitino multiplet. This hints to the
existence of new versions of extended supergravities, in particular N=4 where
such upper bounds are evaded and where all possible vacua have a reduced
supersymmetry N_0<N. We name them shadow supergravities. In particular, using
arguments based on the solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the scalar
manifold, we discuss the possible structure of shadow N=4 supergravity. Using
our previous results on the SCFT dual of the AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0} vacuum we
discuss the SCFT realization of the universal N=3 shadow multiplet. RG flows
from an N=4 to an N=3 phase are ruled out by the fact that the N=4 vacuum is at
infinite distance in moduli space, denoting the presence of a topology change.
