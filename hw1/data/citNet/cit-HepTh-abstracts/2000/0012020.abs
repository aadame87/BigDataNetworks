  The thermodynamics of nearly-extreme charged black holes depends upon the
number of ground states at fixed large charge and upon the distribution of
excited energy states. Here three possibilities are examined: (1) Ground state
highly degenerate (as suggested by the large semiclassical Hawking entropy of
an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole), excited states not. (2) All energy
levels highly degenerate, with macroscopic energy gaps between them. (3) All
states nondegenerate (or with low degeneracy), separated by exponentially tiny
energy gaps. I suggest that in our world with broken supersymmetry, this last
possibility seems most plausible. An experiment is proposed to distinguish
between these possibilities, but it would take a time that is here calculated
to be more than about 10^837 years.
