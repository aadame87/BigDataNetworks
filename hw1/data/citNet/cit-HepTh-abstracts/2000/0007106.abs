  We discuss the properties of the bound state (F1, D1, D3) in IIB supergravity
in three different scaling limits and the $SL(2,{\bf Z})$ transformation of the
resulting theories. In the simple decoupling limit with finite electric and
magnetic components of NS $B$ field, the worldvolume theory is the ${\cal N}$=4
super Yang-Mills (SYM) and the supergravity dual is still the $AdS_5 \times
S^5$. In the large magnetic field limit with finite electric field, the theory
is the noncommutative super Yang-Mills (NCSYM), and the supergravity dual is
the same as that without the electric background. We show how to take the
decoupling limit of the closed string for the critical electric background and
finite magnetic field, and that the resulting theory is the noncommutative open
string (NCOS) with both space-time and space-space noncommutativities. It is
shown that under the $SL(2, {\bf Z})$ transformation, the SYM becomes itself
with a different coupling constant, the NCSYM is mapped to a NCOS, and the NCOS
in general transforms into another NCOS and reduces to a NCSYM in a special
case.
