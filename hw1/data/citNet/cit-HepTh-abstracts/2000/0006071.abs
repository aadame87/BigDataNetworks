Title: Noncommutative Tachyons And String Field Theory
Authors: E. Witten
Comments: 10 pp
\\
  It has been shown recently that by turning on a large noncommutativity
parameter, the description of tachyon condensation in string theory can be
drastically simplified. We reconsider these issues from the standpoint of
string field theory, showing that, from this point of view, the key fact is
that in the limit of a large B-field, the string field algebra factors as the
product of an algebra that acts on the string center of mass only and an
algebra that acts on all other degrees of freedom carried by the string.
