  Following a brief review of known vortex solutions in SU(N) gauge-adjoint
Higgs theories we show the existence of a new ``minimal'' vortex solution in
SU(3) gauge theory with two adjoint Higgs bosons. At a critical coupling the
vortex decouples into two abelian vortices, satisfying Bogomol'nyi type, first
order, field equations. The exact value of the vortex energy (per unit length)
is found in terms of the topological charge that equals to the N=2
supersymmetric charge, at the critical coupling. The critical coupling signals
the increase of the underlying supersymmetry.
