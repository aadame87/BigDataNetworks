  Three-dimensional string theories with 16 supersymmetries are believed to
possess a non-perturbative U-duality symmetry $SO(8,24,\Zint)$. By
covariantizing the heterotic one-loop amplitude under U-duality, we propose an
exact expression for the $(\partial \phi)^4$ amplitude, that reproduces known
perturbative limits. The weak-coupling expansion in either of the heterotic,
type II or type I descriptions exhibits the well-known instanton effects, plus
new contributions peculiar to three-dimensional theories, including the
Kaluza-Klein 5-brane, for which we extract the summation measure. This letter
is a post-scriptum to hepth/0001083.
