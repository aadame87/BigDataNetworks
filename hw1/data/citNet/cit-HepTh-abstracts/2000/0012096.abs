  We give an off-shell formulation of the N=2 supersymmetric new nonlinear
vector-tensor multiplet. Interactions arise in this model as a consequence of
gauging the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra, which in contrast to
previous models with local central charge is achieved without a coupling to a
vector multiplet. Furthermore, we present a new action formula that follows
from coupling the N=2 linear multiplet to the vector-tensor multiplet.
