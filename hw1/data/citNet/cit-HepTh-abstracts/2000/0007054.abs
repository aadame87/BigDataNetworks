  I discuss theories of violations of statistics, including intermediate
statistics, parastatistics, parons, and quons. I emphasize quons, which allow
small violations of statistics. I analyze the quon algebra and its
representations, implications of the algebra including the observables allowed
by the superselection rule separating inequivalent representations of the
symmetric group, the conservation of statistics rules, and the rule for
composite systems of quons. I conclude by raising the question of possible
origins of violations of statistics and of the level at which violations should
be expected if they exist.
