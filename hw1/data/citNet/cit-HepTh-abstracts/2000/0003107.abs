  In the paper a concept of a double symmetry is introduced, and its
qualitative characteristics and rigorous definitions are given. We describe two
ways to construct the double-symmetric field theories and present an example
demonstrating the high efficiency of one of them. In noting the existing
double-symmetric theories we draw attention at a dual status of the group
$SU(2)_{L} \otimes SU(2)_{R}$ as a secondary symmetry group, and in this
connexion we briefly discuss logically possible aspects of the $P$-violation in
weak interactions.
