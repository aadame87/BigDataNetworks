  We consider the Seiberg-Witten Toda chains arising in the context of exact
solutions to N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills and their relation to the properties of N=1
SUSY gauge theories. In particular, we discuss their "perturbative" and
"solitonic" degenerations and demonstrate some relations of the latter ones to
the confining properties of N=1 vacua.
