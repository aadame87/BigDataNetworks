  Quantum field theory on d+1-dimensional anti-deSitter space-time admits a
re-interpretation as a quantum field theory with conformal symmetry on
d-dimensional Minkowski space-time. This conjecture originally emerged from
string theory considerations. Here, it is proven in a general framework by an
explicit identification between the local observables of the two corresponding
theories.
