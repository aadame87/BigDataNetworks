  It is argued that D-brane charge takes values in K-homology. For smooth
manifolds with spin structure, this could explain why the phase factor
$\Omega(x)$ calculated with a D-brane state x in IIB theory appears in
Diaconescu, Moore and Witten's computation of the partition function of IIA
string theory.
