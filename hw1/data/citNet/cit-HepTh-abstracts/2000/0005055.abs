  It is of considerable importance to have a numerical method for solving
supersymmetric theories that can support a non-zero central charge. The central
charge in supersymmetric theories is in general a boundary integral and
therefore vanishes when one uses periodic boundary conditions. One is therefore
prevented from studying BPS states in the standard supersymmetric formulation
of DLCQ (SDLCQ). We present a novel formulation of SDLCQ where the fields
satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian is written as the
anti-commutator of two charges, as in SDLCQ. The anti-periodic SDLCQ we
consider breaks supersymmetry at finite resolution, but requires no
renormalization and becomes supersymmetric in the continuum limit. In
principle, this method could be used to study BPS states. However, we find its
convergence to be disappointingly slow.
