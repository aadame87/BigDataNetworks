Title: Space-time discretization: the way to the fundamental element without a
  determined form

  The concept of the random discretization of the space-time is suggested. It
is the way to consistent compatible synthesis of quantum and relativistic
principles and principle of geometrization. The basic idea of this concept is
physical reality of the finite sizes fundamental element of the quantized
space-time. The flat space-time with random discretization is described as the
probability measure space with the set of all possible discretizations of the
flat continual space-time as the set of points. The probability measure can
depend on the geometric parameters of discretizations (a number of regions of a
discretization, their volumes, areas etc.). In this concept the fundamental
length can be defined as the average value of the linear size of a fundamental
element. In this concept the "particle" quantum and the space-time quantum are
identical.
