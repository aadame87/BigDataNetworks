Title: Kaluza-Klein Black Holes in String Theory
Authors: Finn Larsen
Comments: 11 pages; to appear in the proceedings of PASCOS'99
\\
  Non-supersymmetric black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charge
with respect to a single Kaluza-Klein gauge field have much in common with
supersymmetric black holes. Angular momentum conservation and other general
physics principles underlies some of their basic features. Kaluza-Klein black
holes are interpreted in string theory as bound states of D6-branes and
D0-branes. The microscopic theory reproduces the full nonlinear mass formula of
the extremal black holes.
