  By considering the superembedding equation for the Type II superstring we
derive the classical relation between the NSR string and the Type II GS
superstring Grassmannian variables. The connection between the actions of these
two models is also established. Then introducing the proper twistor-like
Lorentz harmonic variables we fix $\kappa-$symmetry of the GS formulation in
the manifestly SO(1,9) Lorentz covariant manner and establish the relation
between the gauge-fixed variables of the NSR and the Type II GS models.
