  In this work we study the dynamics of branes on group manifolds G deep in the
stringy regime. After giving a brief overview of the various branes that can be
constructed within the boundary conformal field theory approach, we analyze in
detail the condensation processes that occur on stacks of such branes. At large
volume our discussion is based on certain effective gauge theories on
non-commutative `fuzzy' spaces. Using the `absorption of the boundary
spin'-principle which was formulated by Affleck and Ludwig in their work on the
Kondo model, we extrapolate the brane dynamics into the stringy regime. For
supersymmetric theories, the resulting condensation processes turn out to be
consistent with the existence of certain conserved charges taking values in
some non-trivial discrete abelian groups. We obtain strong constraints on these
charge groups for G = SU(N). The results may be compared with a recent proposal
of Bouwknegt and Mathai according to which charge groups on curved spaces X
(with a non-vanishing NSNS 3-form field strength H) are given by the twisted
K-groups K*_H(X).
