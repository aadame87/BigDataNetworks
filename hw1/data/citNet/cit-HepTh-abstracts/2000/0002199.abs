Authors: A. Ceresole, G. Dall'Agata, R. D'Auria and S. Ferrara
Comments: 8 pages, uses JHEP.cls, Contribution to the proceedings of the TMR
  Conference on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and

  We give an update on recent results about the matching between CFT operators
and KK states in the AdS/CFT correspondence, and add some new comments on the
realization of the baryonic symmetries from the supergravity point of view.
