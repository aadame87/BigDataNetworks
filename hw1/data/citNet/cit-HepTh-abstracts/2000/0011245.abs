  We discuss the gravitational Higgs mechanism in domain wall background
solutions that arise in the theory of 5-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity
coupled to a scalar field with a non-trivial potential. The scalar fluctuations
in such backgrounds can be completely gauged away, and so can be the
graviphoton fluctuations. On the other hand, we show that the graviscalar
fluctuations do not have normalizable modes. As to the 4-dimensional graviton
fluctuations, in the case where the volume of the transverse dimension is
finite the massive modes are plane-wave normalizable, while the zero mode is
quadratically normalizable. We then discuss the coupling of domain wall gravity
to localized 4-dimensional matter. In particular, we point out that this
coupling is consistent only if the matter is conformal. This is different from
the Randall-Sundrum case as there is a discontinuity in the delta-function-like
limit of such a smooth domain wall - the latter breaks diffeomorphisms only
spontaneously, while the Randall-Sundrum brane breaks diffeomorphisms
explicitly. Finally, at the quantum level both the domain wall as well as the
Randall-Sundrum setups suffer from inconsistencies in the coupling between
gravity and localized matter, as well as the fact that gravity is generically
expected to be delocalized in such backgrounds due to higher curvature terms.
