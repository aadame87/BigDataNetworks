  We study the singularities of the Higgs branch of supersymmetric U(1)^r gauge
theories with eight supercharges. We derive new solutions for the moduli space
of vacua preserving manifestly the eight supercharges by using a geometric
realization of the SU(2)_R symmetry and a separation procedure of the gauge and
SU(2)_R charges, which allow us to put the hypermultiplet vacua in a form
depending on a parameter $\gamma$. For $\gamma=1$, we obtain new models which
flow in the infrared to 2d N=(4,4) conformal models and we show that the
classical moduli spaces are given by intersecting cotangent weighted complex
projective spaces containing the small instanton singularity, discussed in
[17], as a leading special case. We also make comments regarding the d$2d N=4
conformal Liouville description of the Higgs branch throat by following the
analysis of [18]. Other features are also discussed.
