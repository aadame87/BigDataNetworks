Authors: Juan Fernando Ospina Giraldo
Comments: 8 pages, Latex
\\
  The Wess-Zumino couplings for generalized sigma-orbifold fixed-points are
presented and the generalized GS 6-form that encoding the complete
sigma-standard gauge-gravitational-non standard gauge anomaly and its opposite
inflow is derived.
