  I review the arguments in favor of/against the traditional hypothesis that
the Planck, string and compactification scales are all within a couple of
orders of magnitude from each other. I explain how the extreme brane-world
scenario, with TeV type I scale and two large (near millimetric) transverse
dimensions, creates conditions analogous to those of the energy desert and is
thus naturally singled out. I comment on the puzzle of gauge coupling
unification in this context.
