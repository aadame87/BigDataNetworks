  The zero momentum sectors in effective theories of three dimensional QCD
coupled to pseudoreal (two colors) and real (adjoint) quarks in a classically
parity-invariant manner have alternative descriptions in terms of orthogonal
and symplectic ensembles of random matrices. Using this correspondence, we
compute finite-volume QCD partition functions and correlation functions of
Dirac operator eigenvalues in a presence of finite quark masses of the order of
the smallest Dirac eigenvalue. These novel correlation functions, expressed in
terms of quaternion determinants, are reduced to conventional results for the
Gaussian ensembles in the quenched limit.
