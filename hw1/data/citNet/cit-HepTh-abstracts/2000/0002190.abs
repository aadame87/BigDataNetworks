  We address the issue of whether extra dimensions could have an infinite
volume and yet reproduce the effects of observable four-dimensional gravity on
a brane. There is no normalizable zero-mode graviton in this case, nevertheless
correct Newton's law can be obtained by exchanging bulk gravitons. This can be
interpreted as an exchange of a single {\it metastable} 4D graviton. Such
theories have remarkable phenomenological signatures since the evolution of the
Universe becomes high-dimensional at very large scales. Furthermore, the bulk
supersymmetry in the infinite volume limit might be preserved while being
completely broken on a brane. This gives rise to a possibility of controlling
the value of the bulk cosmological constant. Unfortunately, these theories have
difficulties in reproducing certain predictions of Einstein's theory related to
relativistic sources. This is due to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity
in the propagator of a massive graviton. This suggests that all theories in
which contributions to effective 4D gravity come predominantly from the bulk
graviton exchange should encounter serious phenomenological difficulties.
