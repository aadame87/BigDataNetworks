  The main object of the proposed theory is not a pseudometric, but a symmetric
affine connection on the Minkowski space. The coefficients of this connection
have one upper and two lower indices. These coefficients are symmetric with
respect to the permutation of the lower indices. We identify the convolution of
the connection coefficients with the vector - potential of the electromagnetic
field. Then the gravity is the Lorentz force of this electromagnetic field.
