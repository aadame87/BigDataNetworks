  When it comes to the topological aspects, gravity may have profound effects
even at the level of particle physics despite its negligibly small relative
strength well below the Planck scale. In spite of this intriguing possibility,
relatively little attempt has been made toward the exhibition of this
phenomenon in relevant physical systems. In the present work, perhaps the
simplest and the most straightforward new algorithm for generating solutions to
(anti) self-dual Yang-Mills (YM) equation in the typical gravitational
instanton backgrounds is proposed and then applied to find the solutions
practically in all the gravitational instantons known. Solutions thus obtained
turn out to be some kind of instanton-meron hybrids possessing mixed features
of both. Namely, they are rather exotic type of configurations obeying first
order (anti) self-dual YM equation which are everywhere non-singular and have
finite Euclidean YM actions on one hand while exhibiting meron-like large
distance behavior and carrying generally fractional topological charge values
on the other. Close inspection, however, reveals that the solutions are more
like instantons rather than merons in their generic natures.
