  The one loop quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of the
sinh-Gordon model are calculated partially for general boundary conditions. The
model is studied under boundary conditions which are compatible with
integrability, and in the framework of the conventional perturbation theory
generalized to the affine Toda field theory. It is found that the general form
of the related quantum corrections are hypergeometric functions.
