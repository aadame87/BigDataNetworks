  The evolution of the cosmological perturbations is studied in the context of
the Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario, in which our universe is realized on
a three-brane in the five dimensional Anti-de Sitter(AdS) spacetime. We develop
a formalism to solve the coupled dynamics of the cosmological perturbations in
the brane world and the gravitational wave in the AdS bulk. Using our
formalism, the late time evolution of the cosmological scalar perturbations at
any scales larger than the AdS curvature scale $l$ is shown to be identical
with the one obtained in the conventional 4D cosmology, provided the effect of
heavy graviton modes may be neglected. Here the late time means the epoch when
the Hubble horizon $H^{-1}$ in the 4D brane world is sufficiently larger than
the AdS curvature scale $l$. If the inflation occurs sufficiently lower than
$l^{-1}$, the scalar temperature anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave
Background at large scales can be calculated using the constancy of the Bardeen
parameter as is done in the 4D cosmology. The assumption of the result is that
the effect of the massive graviton with mass $m e^{-\alpha_0}>l^{-1}$ in the
brane world is negligible, where $e^{\alpha_0}$ is the scale factor of the
brane world. We also discuss the effect of these massive gravitons on the
evolution of the perturbations.
