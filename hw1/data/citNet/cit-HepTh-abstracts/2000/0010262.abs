  We provide a systematic construction for all n-particle form factors of the
SU(N)_2/U(1)^{N-1}-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model in terms of general
determinant formulae for a huge class of local operators. The ultraviolet limit
is carried out and the corresponding Virasoro central charge together with the
conformal dimensions of various operators are identified. The renormalization
group flow is studied and we find a precise rule, depending on the relative
order of magnitude of the resonance parameters, according to which the theory
decouples into new cosets along the flow.
