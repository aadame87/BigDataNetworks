  We study the gauge theories on noncommutative space. We employ the idea of
the covariant position to understand the linear and angular momenta, the center
of mass position, and to express all gauge invariant observables including the
Wilson line. In addition, we utilize the universality of the U(1) gauge theory,
which originates from the underlying matrix theory, to analyze various solitons
on U(N) theories, like the unstable static vortex solutions in two dimensions
and BPS dyonic fluxon solutions.
