Title: Gravity in Two Spacetime Dimensions

  In this habilitation thesis we provide an introduction to gravitational
models in two spacetime dimensions. Focus is put on exactly solvable models. We
begin by introducing and motivating different possible gravitational actions,
including those of generalized dilaton theories as well as of purely
geometrical, higher derivative theories with and without torsion. The relation
among them as well as to Poisson sigma models is worked out in some detail. In
the exactly solvable cases, such as pure gravity-Yang-Mills systems, the
general solution to the field equations on a global level is reviewed.
Quantization of such models is performed in the Dirac approach, where, by use
of the formulation as Poisson sigma models, all admissible physical quantum
states are obtained.
  Table of contents: 1. Introduction, 2. 2d geometry and gravitational actions,
3. Generalized dilaton theories and matter actions, 4. 2d gravity-Yang-Mills
systems in terms of Poisson sigma models, 5. Classical solutions on a local
level, 6. Classical solutions on a global level, 7. Towards quantum gravity.
