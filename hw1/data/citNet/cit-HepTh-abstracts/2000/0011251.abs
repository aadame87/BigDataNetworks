  In this note we analyse the dynamical potential of a system of four
$Dp$-branes at arbitrary angles. The equilibrium configurations for various
values of the relative angles and distances among branes are discussed. The
known configurations of parallel branes and brane-antibranes are obtained at
extrema of the dynamical potential.
