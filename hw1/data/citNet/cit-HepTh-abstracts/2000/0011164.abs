Title: Comments Concerning the CFT Description of Small Objects in AdS
Authors: V. Hubeny, L. Susskind, N. Toumbas
Comments: 8 pages, no figures
\\
  In this paper we resolve a contradiction posed in a recent paper by Horowitz
and Hubeny. The contradiction concerns the way small objects in AdS space are
described in the holographic dual CFT description.
