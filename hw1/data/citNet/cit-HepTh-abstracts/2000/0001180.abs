  In this paper we make the connection between semi-classical string
quantization and exact conformal field theory quantization of strings in 2+1
Anti de Sitter spacetime. More precisely, considering the WZWN model
corresponding to SL(2,R) and its covering group, we construct quantum {\it
coherent} string states, which generalize the ordinary coherent states of
quantum mechanics, and show that in the classical limit they correspond to
oscillating circular strings. After quantization, the spectrum is found to
consist of two parts: A continuous spectrum of low mass states (partly
tachyonic) fulfilling the standard spin-level condition necessary for unitarity
|j|< k/2, and a discrete spectrum of high mass states with asymptotic behaviour
m^2\alpha'\propto N^2 (N positive integer). The quantization condition for the
high mass states arises from the condition of finite positive norm of the
coherent string states, and the result agrees with our previous results
obtained using semi-classical quantization. In the k\to\infty limit, all the
usual properties of coherent or {\it quasi-classical} states are recovered. It
should be stressed that we consider the circular strings only for simplicity
and clarity, and that our construction can easily be used for other string
configurations too. We also compare our results with those obtained in the
recent preprint hep-th/0001053 by Maldacena and Ooguri.
