  We discuss non-extremal rotating D3-branes. We solve the wave equation for
scalars in the supergravity background of certain distributions of branes and
compute the absorption coefficients. The form of these coefficients is similar
to the gray-body factors associated with black-hole scattering. They are given
in terms of two different temperature parameters, indicating that fields (open
string modes) do not remain in thermal equilibrium as we move off extremality.
This should shed some light on the origin of the disagreement between the
supergravity and conformal field theory results on the free energy of a system
of non-coincident D-branes.
