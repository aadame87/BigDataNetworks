  By using tensor analysis, we find a connection between normed algebras and
the parallelizability of the spheres S$^1$, S$^3$ and S$^7.$ In this process,
we discovered the analogue of Hurwitz theorem for curved spaces and a
geometrical unified formalism for the metric and the torsion. In order to
achieve these goals we first develope a proof of Hurwitz theorem based in
tensor analysis. It turns out that in contrast to the doubling procedure and
Clifford algebra mechanism, our proof is entirely based in tensor algebra
applied to the normed algebra condition. From the tersor analysis point of view
our proof is straightforward and short. We also discuss a possible connection
between our formalism and the Cayley-Dickson algebras and Hopf maps.
