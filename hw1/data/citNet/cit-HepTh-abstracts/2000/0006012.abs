  The present review aims both to offer some motivations and mathematical
prerequisites for a study of NCG from the viewpoint of a theoretical physicist
and to show a few applications to matrix theory and results obtained.
  Lectures given by the author at the TMR School on contemporary string theory
and brane physics, 26 Jan--2 Feb 2000, Torino.
