  T-duality of gauge theories on a noncommutative $T^d$ can be extended to
include fields with twisted boundary conditions. The resulting T-dual theories
contain novel nonlocal fields. These fields represent dipoles of constant
magnitude. Several unique properties of field theories on noncommutative spaces
have simpler counterparts in the dipole-theories.
