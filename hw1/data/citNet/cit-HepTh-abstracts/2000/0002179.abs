  In this paper we investigate the vacuum expectation values of energy-
momentum tensor for conformally coupled scalar field in the standard parallel
plate geometry with Dirichlet boundary conditions and on background of planar
domain wall case. First we calculate the vacuum expectation values of
energy-momentum tensor by using the mode sums, then we show that corresponding
properties can be obtained by using the conformal properties of the problem.
The vacuum expectation values of energy-momentum tensor contains two terms
which come from the boundary conditions and the the gravitational background.
In the Minkovskian limit our results agree with those obtained in [3].
