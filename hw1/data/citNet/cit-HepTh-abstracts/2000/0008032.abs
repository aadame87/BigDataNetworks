  An action with unconventional supersymmetry was introduced in an earlier
paper. Here it is shown that this action leads to standard physics for fermions
and gauge bosons at low energy, but to testable extensions of standard physics
for fermions at high energy and for fundamental bosons which have not yet been
observed. For example, the Lorentz-violating equation of motion for these
bosons implies that they have spin 1/2.
