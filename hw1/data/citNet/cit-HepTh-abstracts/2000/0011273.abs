  We review our work on computations of the quantum corrections to the mass and
the central charge of the susy kink. For the mass corrections, we find that the
widely used momentum cut-off scheme gives an incorrect result, but we deduce
through smoothing of the cut-off an extra term in the mass formula, which
produces the correct result. We discover the importance of boundary effects for
the mode number cut-off regularization scheme. We introduce the notion of
delocalized boundary energy. We discuss two discrete $Z_2$ symmetries and their
importance to the mode number approach. For the central charge corrections, we
use momentum cut-off regularization with two cut-offs, one for propagators and
another for Dirac delta functions. We then compute the quantum anomaly in the
central charge, and find that it restores the BPS bound at the one-loop level
if the two cut-offs are equal.
