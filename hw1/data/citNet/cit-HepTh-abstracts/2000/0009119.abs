  Several pieces of evidence have been recently brought up in favour of the
c-theorem in four and higher dimensions, but a solid proof is still lacking. We
present two basic results which could be useful for this search: i) the values
of the putative c-number for free field theories in any even dimension, which
illustrate some properties of this number; ii) the general form of three-point
function of the stress tensor in four dimensions, which shows some physical
consequences of the c-number and of the other trace-anomaly numbers.
