  This paper proves that it is possible to build a Lagrangian for quantum
electrodynamics which makes it explicit that the photon mass is eventually set
to zero in the physical part on observational ground. Gauge independence is
achieved upon considering the joint effect of gauge-averaging term and ghost
fields. It remains possible to obtain a counterterm Lagrangian where the only
non-gauge-invariant term is proportional to the squared divergence of the
potential, while the photon propagator in momentum space falls off like the
inverse square of k at large k, which indeed agrees with perturbative
renormalizability. The resulting radiative corrections to the Coulomb potential
in QED are also shown to be gauge-independent. The experience acquired with
quantum electrodynamics is used to investigate properties and problems of the
extension of such ideas to non-Abelian gauge theories.
