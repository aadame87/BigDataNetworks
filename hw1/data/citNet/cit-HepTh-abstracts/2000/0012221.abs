  We consider a brane world residing in the interior region inside the horizon
of the D3-brane. The horizon size then can be interpreted as the
compactification size. The macroscopically large size of extra dimensions can
be derived from the underlying string theory that has only one physical scale,
{\it i.e.,} the string scale. Then, the hierarchy between the string scale and
the Planck scale is provided by Ramon-Ramon charge of the D3-brane. This
picture also offers a new perspective on various issues associated with the
brane world scenarios including the cosmological constant.
