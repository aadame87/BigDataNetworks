Title: The basic principles of geometrization of the quantum mechanics
Authors: K.B. Korotchenko (Tomsk Polytechnical University, Rossia)

  The basic principles of the quantum mechanics in the K-field formalism (see
author's papers) are stated in the paper. K-field formalism arises from
geometric generalization of de Broglie postulate. So, the quantum theory
equations (including well-known Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon and quadratic Dirac
equations) are obtained as the free wave equations on a manifold metrizing
force interactions of particles. In this paper, describing wave properties of
particles we will restricted ourself with construction special geometric
formulation of force interactions.
