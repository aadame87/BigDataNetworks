  A discrete symmetry of the string field tachyon condensate noted by Hata and
Shinohara is identified as a discrete subgroup of an SU(1,1) symmetry acting on
the ghost coordinates. This symmetry, known from early studies of free gauge
invariant string field actions, extends to off-shell interactions only for very
restricted kinds of string vertices, among them the associative vertex of cubic
string field theory. It follows that the string field relevant for tachyon
condensation can be trimmed down to SU(1,1) singlets.
