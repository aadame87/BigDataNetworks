  We derive the graviton propagator on the brane for theories with
quasi-localized gravity. In these models the ordinary 4D graviton is replaced
by a resonance in the spectrum of massive Kaluza-Klein modes, which can decay
into the extra dimension. We find that the effects of the extra polarization in
the massive graviton propagator is exactly cancelled by the bending of the
brane due to the matter sources, up to small corrections proportional to the
width of the resonance. Thus at intermediate scales the classic predictions of
Einstein's gravity are reproduced in these models to arbitrary precision.
