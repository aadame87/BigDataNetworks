  From a supersymmetry covariant source extension of N=2 SYM we study
non-trivial thermodynamical limits thereof. Using an argument by one of us
about the solution of the strong CP problem and the uniqueness of the QCD
ground state we find that the dependence of the effective potential on the
defining field operators is severely restricted. In contrast to the solution by
Seiberg and Witten an acceptable infrared behavior only exists for broken
supersymmetry while the gauge symmetry remains unbroken.
