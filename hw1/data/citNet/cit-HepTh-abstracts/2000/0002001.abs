  We propose relativistic second quantization of matrix model of D particles in
a general framework of nonlocal field theory based on Snyder-Yang's quantized
space-time. Second-quantized nonlocal field is in general noncommutative with
quantized space-time, but conjectured to become commutative with light cone
time $X^+$. This conjecture enables us to find second-quantized Hamiltonian of
D particle system and Heisenberg's equation of motion of second-quantized {\bf
D} field in close contact with Hamiltonian given in matrix model. We propose
Hamilton's principle of Lorentz-invariant action of {\bf D} field and
investigate what conditions or approximations are needed to reproduce the above
Heisenberg's equation given in light cone time. Both noncommutativities
appearing in position coordinates of D particles in matrix model and in
quantized space-time will be eventually unified through second quantization of
matrix model.
