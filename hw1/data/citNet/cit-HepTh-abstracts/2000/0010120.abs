  We investigated the bubble collisions during the first order phase
transitions. Numerical results indicate that within the certain range of
parameters the collision of two bubbles leads to formation of separate
relatively long-lived quasilumps - configurations filled with scalar field
oscillating around the true vacuum state. Energy is perfectly localized, and
density is slightly pulsating around its maximum. This process is accompanied
by radiation of scalar waves.
