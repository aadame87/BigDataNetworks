  In light-cone quantization, the standard procedure to characterize the phases
of a system by appropriate ground state expectation values fails. The
light-cone vacuum is determined kinematically. We show that meaningful
quantities which can serve as order parameters are obtained as expectation
values of Heisenberg operators in the equal (light-cone) time limit. These
quantities differ from the purely kinematical expectation values of the
corresponding Schroedinger operators. For the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio and the
Gross-Neveu model, we describe the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry; we
derive within light-cone quantization the corresponding gap equations and the
values of the chiral condensate.
