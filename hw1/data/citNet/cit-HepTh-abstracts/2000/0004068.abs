Title: Enhancons, Fuzzy Spheres and Multi-Monopoles
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson
Comments: 25 pages, latex, 3 primary figures, psfig (v2: Omission of references
  to important early work on multi-monopoles is fixed. Note added on possible
  relations to certain other recent work on large N, monopoles, and
  non-commutativity. A few typos fixed.) (v3: Extensive revision. Statements
  about role of Atiyah-Hitchin manifold and instanton corrections refined.
  Speculation about location of Higgs zeros removed. Discussion improved in
  many places.)

  We study the `enhancon', a spherical hypersurface apparently made of
D-branes, which arises in string theory studies of large N SU(N) pure gauge
theories with eight supercharges. When the gauge theory is 2+1 dimensional, the
enhancon is an S^2. A relation to charge N BPS multi-monopoles is exploited to
uncover many of its detailed properties. It is simply a spherical slice through
an Atiyah-Hitchin-like submanifold of the charge $N$ BPS monopole moduli space.
In the form of Nahm data, it is built from the N dimensional irreducible
representation of SU(2). In this sense the enhancon is a non-commutative
sphere, reminiscent of the spherical `dielectric' branes of Myers.
