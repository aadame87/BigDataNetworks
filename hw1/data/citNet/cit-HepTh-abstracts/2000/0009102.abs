  Using canonical method the Liouville theory has been obtained as a
gravitational Wess-Zumino action of the Polyakov string. From this approach it
is clear that the form of the Liouville action is the consequence of the
bosonic representation of the Virasoro algebra, and that the coefficient in
front of the action is proportional to the central charge and measures the
quantum braking of the classical symmetry.
