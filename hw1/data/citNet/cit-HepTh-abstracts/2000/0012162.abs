  A concise survey is given of the general method of reduction in the number of
coupling parameters. Theories with several independent couplings are related to
a set of theories with a single coupling. The reduced theories may or may not
have particular symmetries. A few have asymptotic power series expansions,
others contain non-integer powers and/or logarithmic factors. An example is
given with two power series solutions, one with N = 2 Supersymmetry, and one
with no known symmetry. In a second example, the reduced Yukawa coupling of the
superpotential in a dual magnetic supersymmetric gauge theory is uniquely given
by the square of the magnetic gauge coupling with a known factor.
