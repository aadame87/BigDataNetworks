  What do simple clocks, simple computers, black holes, space-time foam, and
holographic principle have in common? I will show that the physics behind them
is inter-related, linking together our concepts of information, gravity, and
quantum uncertainty. Thus, the physics that sets the limits to computation and
clock precision also yields Hawking radiation of black holes and the
holographic principle. Moreover, the latter two strongly imply that space-time
undergoes much larger quantum fluctuations than what the folklore suggests ---
large enough to be detected with modern gravitational-wave interferometers
through future refinements.
