Title: Implications of N = 2 Superconformal Symmetry
Authors: Sergei Kuzenko and Stefan Theisen (University of Munich)
Comments: 7 pages, latex, JHEP style, no figures; based on talks delivered at
  the Workshop on Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries, Dubna, Russia, 26-31
  Jul 1999, and at the Meeting on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories,
  Supersymmetry and Unification, Paris, France, 1-7 Sep 1999
\\
  We review recent results on the general structure of two- and three- point
functions of the supercurrent and the flavor current of N = 2 superconformal
field theories.
