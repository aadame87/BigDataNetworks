  Using the technique of finite field dependent BRST transformations we show
that the classical massive Yang-Mills theory and the pure Yang-Mills theory
whose gauge symmetry is broken by a gauge fixing term are identical from the
view point of quantum gauge symmetry. The explicit infinitesimal
transformations which leave the massive Yang-Mills theory BRST invariant are
given.
