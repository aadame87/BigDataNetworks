  In this paper we study the invariance of the noncmmutative gauge theories
under C, P and T transformations. For the noncommutative space (when only the
spatial part of $\theta$ is non-zero) we show that NCQED is Parity invariant.
In addition, we show that under charge conjugation the theory on noncommutative
$R^4_{\theta}$ is transformed to the theory on $R^4_{-\theta}$, so NCQED is a
CP violating theory. The theory remains invariant under time reversal if,
together with proper changes in fields, we also change $\theta$ by $-\theta$.
Hence altogether NCQED is CPT invariant. Moreover we show that the CPT
invariance holds for general noncommutative space-time.
