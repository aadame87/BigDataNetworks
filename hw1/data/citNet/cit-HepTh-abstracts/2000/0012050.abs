  In this paper we present simplifying techniques which allow one to compute
the quiver diagrams for various D-branes at (non-Abelian) orbifold
singularities with and without discrete torsion. The main idea behind the
construction is to take the orbifold of an orbifold. Many interesting discrete
groups fit into an exact sequence $N\to G\to G/N$. As such, the orbifold $M/G$
is easier to compute as $(M/N)/(G/N)$ and we present graphical rules which
allow fast computation given the $M/N$ quiver.
