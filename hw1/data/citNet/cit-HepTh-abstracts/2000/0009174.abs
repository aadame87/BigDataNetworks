  We show that the recently proposed formulation of noncommutative N=2 Super
Yang-Mills theory implies that the commutative and noncommutative effective
coupling constants \tau(u) and \tau_{nc}(u) coincide. We then introduce a key
relation which allows to find a nontrivial solution of such equation, thus
fixing the form of the low-energy effective action. The dependence on the
noncommutative parameter arises from a rational function deforming the
Seiberg-Witten differential.
