  We find a class of exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theories
corresponding to unstable non-BPS solitons. In the two-dimensional euclidean
(or 2+1 dimensional lorentzian) U(1) theory we find localized solutions
carrying nonzero magnetic flux. In four euclidean dimensions we find non-BPS
solutions with the same Pontrjagin charge but greater energy than the usual
self-dual Yang-Mills instanton. We conjecture that these solutions and
generalizations thereof correspond to nonsupersymmetric configurations of
D-(p-2k) branes (or intersections thereof) in a D-p brane in the noncommutative
scaling limit of large B-field. In the particular case of a 0-brane on a
2-brane the analysis of small fluctuations reveals an infinite tower of states
which agrees exactly with that of the 0-2 CFT in the scaling limit. The
spectrum contains a tachyon, and we show explicitly that the endpoint of
tachyon condensation corresponds to the 0-brane dissolved in the 2-brane.
