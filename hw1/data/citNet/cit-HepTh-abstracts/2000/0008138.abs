  A (2+1)-static black hole solution with a nonlinear electric field is
derived. The source to the Einstein equations is a nonlinear electrodynamics,
satisfying the weak energy conditions, and it is such that the energy momentum
tensor is traceless. The obtained solution is singular at the origin of
coordinates. The derived electric field E(r) is given by $E(r)=q/r^2$, thus it
has the Coulomb form of a point charge in the Minkowski spacetime. This
solution describes charged (anti)--de Sitter spaces. An interesting
asymptotically flat solution arises for $\Lambda=0$.
