  An extension of the Super KdV integrable system in terms of operator valued
functions is obtained. Following the ideas of Gardner, a general algebraic
approach for finding the infinitely many conserved quantities of integrable
systems is presented. The approach is applied to the above described system and
infinitely many conserved quantities are constructed. In a particular case they
reduce to the corresponding conserved quantities of Super KdV.
