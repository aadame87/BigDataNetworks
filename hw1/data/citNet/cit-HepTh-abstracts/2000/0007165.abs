Title: Fractional Supersymmetry through Generalized Anyonic algebra
Authors: J.Douari and Y.Hassouni
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  The construction of anyonic operators and algebra is generalized by using
quons operators. Therefore, the particular versionof fractional supersymmetry
is constructed on the two-dimensional lattice by associating two generalized
anyons of different kinds. The fractional supersymmetry Hamiltonian operator is
obtained on the two-dimensional lattice and the quantum algebra $U_{q}(sl_{2})$
is realized.
