  We show that a previous paper of Freund describing a solution to the
Seiberg-Witten equations has a sign error rendering it a solution to a related
but different set of equations. The non-$L^2$ nature of Freund's solution is
discussed and clarified and we also construct a whole class of solutions to the
Seiberg-Witten equations.
