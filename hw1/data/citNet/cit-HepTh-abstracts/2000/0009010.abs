  In Randall-Sundrum-type brane-world cosmologies, density perturbations
generate Weyl curvature in the bulk, which in turn backreacts on the brane via
stress-energy perturbations. On large scales, the perturbation equations
contain a closed system on the brane, which may be solved without solving for
the bulk perturbations. Bulk effects produce a non-adiabatic mode, even when
the matter perturbations are adiabatic, and alter the background dynamics. As a
consequence, the standard evolution of large-scale fluctuations in general
relativity is modified. The metric perturbation on large-scales is not constant
during high-energy inflation. It is constant during the radiation era, except
at most during the very beginning, if the energy is high enough.
