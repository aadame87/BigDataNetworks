  We study noncommutative field theories at finite temperature to learn more
about the degrees of freedom in the non-planar sector of these systems. We find
evidence for winding states. At temperatures for which the thermal wavelength
is smaller than the noncommutativity scale, there is a drastic reduction of the
degrees of freedom in the non-planar sector. In this regime, the non-planar
sector has thermodynamics resembling that of a 1+1 dimensional field theory.
