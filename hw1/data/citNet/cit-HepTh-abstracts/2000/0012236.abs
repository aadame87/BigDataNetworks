  Starting from nonlinear realizations of the partially broken central-charge
extended N=4 and N=8 Poincar\'e supersymmetries in D=4, we derive the
superfield equations of N=2 and N=4 Born-Infeld theories. The basic objects are
the bosonic Goldstone N=2 and N=4 superfields associated with the central
charge generators. By construction, the equations are manifestly N=2 and N=4
supersymmetric and enjoy covariance under another nonlinearly realized half of
the original supersymmetries. They provide a manifestly worldvolume
supersymmetric static-gauge description of D3-branes in D=6 and D=10. For the
N=2 case we find, to lowest orders, the equivalence transformation to the
standard N=2 Maxwell superfield strength and restore, up to the sixth order,
the off-shell N=2 Born-Infeld action with the second hidden N=2 supersymmetry.
