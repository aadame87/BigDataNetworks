  We show that massless RR tadpoles in vacuum configurations with open and
unoriented strings are always related to anomalies. RR tadpoles arising from
sectors of the internal SCFT with non-vanishing Witten index are in one-to-one
correspondence with conventional irreducible anomalies. The anomalous content
of the remaining RR tadpoles can be disclosed by considering anomalous
amplitudes with higher numbers of external legs. We then provide an explicit
parametrization of the anomaly polynomial in terms of the boundary reflection
coefficients, i.e. one-point functions of massless RR fields on the disk. After
factorization of the reducible anomaly, we extract the relevant WZ couplings in
the effective lagrangians.
