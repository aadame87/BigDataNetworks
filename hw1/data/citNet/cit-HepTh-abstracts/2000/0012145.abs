  Noncommutative geometry is based on an idea that an associative algebra can
be regarded as "an algebra of functions on a noncommutative space". The major
contribution to noncommutative geometry was made by A. Connes, who, in
particular, analyzed Yang-Mills theories on noncommutative spaces, using
important notions that were introduced in his papers (connection, Chern
character, etc). It was found recently that Yang-Mills theories on
noncommutative spaces appear naturally in string/M-theory; the notions and
results of noncommutative geometry were applied very successfully to the
problems of physics.
  In this paper we give a mostly self-contained review of some aspects of
M(atrix) theory, of Connes' noncommutative geometry and of applications of
noncommutative geometry to M(atrix) theory. The topics include introduction to
BFSS and IKKT matrix models, compactifications on noncommutative tori, a review
of basic notions of noncommutative geometry with a detailed discussion of
noncommutative tori, Morita equivalence and $SO(d,d|{\mathbb Z})$-duality, an
elementary discussion of instantons and noncommutative orbifolds. The review is
primarily intended for physicists who would like to learn some basic techniques
of noncommutative geometry and how they can be applied in string theory and to
mathematicians who would like to learn about some new problems arising in
theoretical physics.
