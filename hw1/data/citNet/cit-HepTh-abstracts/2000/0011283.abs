  We construct Spin(p+1,p+1) covariant Dp-brane bound states by using that the
potentials in the RR sector of toroidically compactified type II supergravity
transform as a chiral spinor of the T-duality group. As an application, we show
the invariance of the zero-force condition for a probe D-brane under
noncommutative deformations of the background, which gives a holographic proof
of the stability of the corresponding field theory ground state under
noncommutative deformations. We also identify the Spin(p+1,p+1) transformation
laws by examining the covariance of the D-brane Lagrangians.
