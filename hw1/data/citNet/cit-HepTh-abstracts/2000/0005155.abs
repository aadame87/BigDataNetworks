Title: Equivalence Theorem for Lagrangians in Different Dimensions
Authors: L. M. Baker (University of Durham)

\\
  A proof is given for the observation that the equations of motion for the
companion Lagrangian without a square root, subject to some constraints, just
reduce to the equations of motion for the companion Lagrangian with a square
root in one less dimension. The companion Lagrangian is just an extension of
the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian to more fields in order to provide a field
description for strings and branes.
