  Causal perturbative renormalization within the recursive Epstein-Glaser
scheme involves extending, at each order, time-ordered operator-valued
distributions to coinciding points. This is achieved by a generalized Taylor
subtraction on test functions, which is transposed to distributions. We show
how the Epstein-Glaser recursive construction can, by means of a slight
modification of the Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs, be recast in terms of the
new Connes-Kreimer algebraic setup for renormalization. This is illustrated for
$\phi^4_4$-theory.
