  In this paper we consider D=4 NCSYM theories with 8 supercharges. We study
these theories through a proper type IIA (and M-theory) brane configuration. We
find the one loop beta function of these theories and show that there is an
elliptic curve describing the moduli space of the theory, which is in principle
the same as the curve for the commutative counter-part of our theory. We study
some other details of the dynamics by means of this brane configuration.
