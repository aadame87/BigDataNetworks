  An approach to scattering theory in three dimensional AdS spaces is proposed.
Firstly we consider the scattering of spinless relativistic particles by a
three dimensional extremal black hole and compute the absorption cross section
$\sigma_{abs} =J_{abs}/J_{\infty}$ without using {\it in} and {\it out} states.
Secondly, we posit a reciprocal space ${\cal H}$ where {\it in} and {\it out}
states and the scattering amplitude is defined as in usual scattering theory.
We show that both descriptions are equivalent and ${\cal H}$ could be
considered as the space where the scattering processes in AdS should be
defined.
