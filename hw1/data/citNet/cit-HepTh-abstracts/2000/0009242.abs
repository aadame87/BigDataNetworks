  Some properties of N=2 superstrings on AdS_3 x N are studied. Their spectrum
has the same pattern as 2-d CFTs in the moduli space of symmetric products
M^p/S_p, where p is associated with the number of long fundamental strings
required to construct the AdS_3 background, and M is the spacetime CFT
corresponding to short string excitations of a single long string. Worldsheet
operators associated with w long strings correspond to twisted sectors of
M^p/S_p.
