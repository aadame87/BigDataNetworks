  In this letter we use Type II NS5-branes in the presence of an RR field at
the decoupling limit to study a non-commutative version of little string
theory. We shall see that the decoupling limit of NS5-branes in the presence of
an RR field is completely different from the one we had in ordinary little
string theory; in particular for Type IIA NS5-branes this decoupling limit can
be defined only when the theory is wrapped on a circle, but nevertheless flows
to the ordinary non-compact (0,2) theory at the IR limit. We also see that
these theories, in the UV regime, where the non-commutative effects are
important, can be described by smeared ordinary D3(D2)-branes in Type IIB(A)
string theory.
