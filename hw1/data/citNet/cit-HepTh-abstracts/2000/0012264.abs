  Using the zeta function regularization method we calculate the ground state
energy of scalar massive field inside a spherical region in the space-time of a
point-like global monopole. Two cases are investigated: (i) We calculate the
Casimir energy inside a sphere of radius $R$ and make an analytical analysis
about it. We observe that this energy may be positive or negative depending on
metric coefficient $\alpha$ and non-conformal coupling $\xi$. In the limit
$R\to\infty$ we found a zero result. (ii) In the second model we surround the
monopole by additional sphere of radius $r_0<R$ and consider scalar field
confined in the region between these two spheres. In the latter, the ground
state energy presents an additional contribution due to boundary at $r_0$ which
is divergent for small radius. Additional comments about renormalization are
considered.
