  We give a path integral derivation of the annulus diagram in a supersymmetric
theory of open and closed strings with Dbranes. We compute the pair correlation
function of Wilson loops in the generic weakly coupled supersymmetric flat
spacetime background with Dbranes. We obtain a -u^4/r^9 potential between heavy
nonrelativistic sources in a supersymmetric gauge theory at short distances.
