Title: Phase transition in Wilson loop correlator from AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: P. Olesen, K. Zarembo
Comments: 9 pages, 2 figures
\\
  A previous calculation of the phase transition in the Wilson loop correlator
in the zero temperature AdS/CFT correspondence is extended to the case where
the loops are concentric circles of unequal radii. This phase transition occurs
due to the instability of the classical string stretched between the loops. We
compute the string action and its expansion in the distance h between the loops
for small h. We also find that the connected minimal surface is subleading or
does not even exist when h=0 and the radii are considerably different. This
feature has no analogue in flat space.
