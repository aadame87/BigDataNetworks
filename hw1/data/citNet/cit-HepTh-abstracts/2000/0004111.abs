  We give the full lagrangean and supersymmetry transformation rules for D=5,
N=2 supergravity interacting with an arbitrary number of vector, tensor and
hyper-multiplets, with gauging of the R-symmetry group SU(2)_R as well as a
subgroup K of the isometries of the scalar manifold. Among the many possible
applications, this theory provides the setting where a supersymmetric
brane-world scenario could occur. We comment on the presence of AdS vacua and
BPS solutions that would be relevant towards a supersymmetric smooth
realization of the Randall-Sundrum "alternative to compactification". We also
add some remarks on the connection between this most general 5D fully coupled
supergravity model and type IIB theory on the T^{11} manifold.
