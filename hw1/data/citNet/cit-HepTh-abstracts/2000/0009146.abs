  The extraction of Wilson loops of confining gauge systems from their SUGRA
(string) duals is reviewed. I start with describing the basic classical setup.
A theorem that determines the classical values of the loops associated with a
generalized background is derived. In particular sufficient conditions for
confining behavior are stated . I then introduce quadratic quantum fluctuations
around the classical configurations. I discuss in details the following models
of confining behavior: (i) Strings in flat space-time, (ii) $AdS_5$ black hole
and its correspondence with pure YM theory in three dimensions. In particular
an attractive Luscher term is shown to be the outcome of the quantum
fluctuations. (iii) Type 0 string model (iv) The Polchinski Strassler $N=1*$
model. In the latter case we show that SUGRA alone is not enough to get the
correct nature of the loops, and only by incorporating the worldvolume
phenomena of the five branes a coherent qualitative picture can be derived.
