  It is known that self-duality equations for multi-instantons on a line in
four dimensions are equivalent to minimal surface equations in three
dimensional Minkowski space. We extend this equivalence beyond the equations of
motion and show that topological number, instanton moduli space and
anti-self-dual solutions have representations in terms of minimal surfaces. The
issue of topological charge is quite subtle because the surfaces that appear
are non-compact. This minimal surface/instanton correspondence allows us to
define a metric on the configuration space of the gauge fields. We obtain the
minimal surface representation of an instanton with arbitrary charge. The
trivial vacuum and the BPST instanton as minimal surfaces are worked out in
detail. BPS monopoles and the geodesics are also discussed.
