  In this paper some properties of the irreducible multiplets of representation
for the N = (p, q) - extended supersymmetry in one dimension are discussed.
Essentially two results are here presented. At first a peculiar property of the
one dimension is exhibited, namely that any multiplet containing 2d (d bosonic
and d fermionic) particles in M different spin states, is equivalent to a (d,d)
multiplet of just 2 spin states (all bosons and all fermions being grouped in
the same spin). Later, it is shown that the classification of all multiplets of
this kind carrying an irreducible representation of the N - extended
supersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the classification of
real-valued Clifford Gamma-matrices of Weyl type. In particular, p+q is mapped
into D, the space-time dimensionality, while 2d is determined to be the
dimensionality of the corresponding Gamma-matrices. The implications of these
results to the theory of spinning particles are analyzed.
