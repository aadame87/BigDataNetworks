  In this note we prove the complete stability of the classical fluctuation
modes of the rotating ellipsoidal membrane. The analysis is carried out in the
full SU(N) setting, with the conclusion that the fluctuation matrix has only
positive eigenvalues. This proves that the solution will remain close to the
original one for all time, under arbitrary infinitesimal perturbations of the
gauge fields.
