  The general model of higher derivative (HD) gravity is considered. The search
of brane-world cosmology in such theory is presented when bulk is d5 AdS and
boundary is spherical, hyperbolic or flat (single) brane. It is found the wide
range of theory parameters where such cosmology may be realized. Special
attention is paid to the version of HD theory representing SG dual of ${\cal
N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ SCFT (in next-to-leading order of large $N$ expansion). In
particular, it is shown that inflationary brane Universe does not occur for SG
dual while hyperbolic brane occurs (which was not possible in leading order).
  The quantum effects of CFT living on the brane (via the corresponding
conformal anomaly induced effective action) may qualitatively change the
results of classical analysis. There appears inflationary (or hyperbolic) brane
Universe induced by only quantum effects. In AdS/CFT correspondence
(next-to-leading order) the addition of such CFT effective action (in some
energy region) is naturally explained in terms of holographic renormalization
group. It results in the possibility of quantum creation of inflationary brane
Universe (with small rate) even for SG dual.
