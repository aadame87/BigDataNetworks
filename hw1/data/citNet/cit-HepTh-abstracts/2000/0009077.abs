\\
  In this short note, inspired by much recent activity centered around attempts
to formulate various correspondences between the classification of affine SU(k)
WZW modular-invariant partition functions and that of discrete finite subgroups
of SU(k), we present a small and perhaps interesting observation in this light.
In particular we show how the groups generated by the permutation of the terms
in the exceptional Affine SU(2)-WZW invariants encode the corresponding
exceptional SU(2) subgroups.
