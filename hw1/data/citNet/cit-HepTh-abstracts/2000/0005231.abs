Title: Vacuum Polarization Using Quantum Mechanical Path Integrals
Authors: Walter Dittrich (Tubingen U.)
Comments: 17 pages, 2 figures
\\
  We compute the quantum vacuum polarization for a pure neutral scalar field
theory within the context of single-particle quantum mechanics. The loop
diagram is computed without ever encountering loop-momentum integrals. Our
approach is based on standard Feynman path integrals. Contact is made to scalar
QED.
