Title: QCD Inequalities, Large $N_C$ and $\pi\pi$ Scattering Lengths

  In this short note we show that (I) in a QCD-like theory with four (rather
than two) degenerate flavors $ud u'd'$, the $\pi\pi'$ scattering length is
positive (attractive); and (II) in QCD with only two (u,d) degenerate flavors
the I=2 (say, $\pi^+\pi^+$ hadronic) scattering length is, in the large $N_C$
limit, repulsive. $\pi(\pi')$ are the lowest physical states coupling to $J^p =
\bar{u}(x)\gamma_5d(x)$ and $J^{p'} = \bar{u}'(x)\gamma_5d'(x),$ respectively.
