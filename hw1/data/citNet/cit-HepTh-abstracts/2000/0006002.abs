  Inspiring ourselves by the assumption that the notion of symmetry itself is
insufficient to construct the consistent physics of the Desert (the so-called
region of energies beyond the Standard Model) and some additional insights are
needed, we suggests that high-energy theories must take into account the
higher-order variations of fields. With this in mind we propose the
generalization of the concepts of kinetic energy and free particle. It is shown
that the theory founded on such principles reveals major features of the
genuinely high-energy one, first of all, it appears to be free from
ultra-violet divergences, even the self-energy loop terms become finite. Also
we discuss other arising interesting phenomena such as the high-gradient
currents and charges, unified ``all-in-one'' multi-mass states, VR symmetry,
regularization-without-renormalization of SM, etc.
