  We consider (n + m + 1) dimensional bulk spacetime, containing flat (n + m -
1) dimensional parallel branes, with topology R^{n - 1} \times T^m. We assume
that the graviton and an m-form field are the only bulk fields and that the
m-form field has non vanishing components along the T^m directions only. We
then find that the m-form field, with suitable bulk and brane potentials, can
stabilise the radion modulus at the required value with no fine tuning. We find
self tuning solutions also.
