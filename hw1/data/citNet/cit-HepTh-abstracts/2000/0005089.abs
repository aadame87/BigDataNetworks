  We extend the previous construction of loop transfer matrix to the case of
nonzero self-intersection coupling constant $\kappa$. The loop generalization
of Fourier transformation allows to diagonalize transfer matrices depending on
symmetric difference of loops and express all eigenvalues of $3d$ loop transfer
matrix through the correlation functions of the corresponding 2d statistical
system. The loop Fourier transformation allows to carry out analogy with
quantum mechanics of point particles, to introduce conjugate loop momentum P
and to define loop quantum mechanics. We also consider transfer matrix on $4d$
lattice which describes propagation of memebranes. This transfer matrix can
also be diagonalized by using generalized Fourier transformation, and all its
eigenvalues are equal to the correlation functions of the corresponding $3d$
statistical system.
