  We propose a new point of view to gauge theories based on taking the action
of symmetry transformations directly on the coordinates of space. Via this
approach the gauge fields are not introduced at the first step, and they can be
interpreted as fluctuations around some classical solutions of the model. The
new point of view is connected to the lattice formulation of gauge theories,
and the parameter of noncommutativity of coordinates appears as the lattice
spacing parameter. Through the statements concerning the continuum limit of
lattice gauge theories, this suggestion arises that noncommutative spaces are
the natural ones to formulate gauge theories at strong coupling. Via this point
of view, a close relation between the large-N limit of gauge theories and
string theory can be manifested.
