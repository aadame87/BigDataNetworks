  We present a finite energy topological Z(2) vortex solution in a 2+1
dimensional SO(3) gauge field theory minimally coupled to a matrix valued Higgs
field. The vortex carries a Z(2) magnetic charge and obeys a modulo two
addition property. The core of this vortex has a structure similar to that of
the Abrikosov vortex appearing in a type II superconductor. The implications of
this solution for Wilson loops are quite interesting. In two Euclidean
dimensions these vortices are instantons and a dilute gas of such vortices
disorders Wilson loops producing an area law behaviour with an exponentially
small string tension. In 2+1 dimensions the vortices are loops and they affect
the same disordering in the phase having large loops.
