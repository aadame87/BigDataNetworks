  We consider the noncommutative Abelian-Higgs theory and investigate general
static vortex configurations including recently found exact multi-vortex
solutions. In particular, we prove that the self-dual BPS solutions cease to
exist once the noncommutativity scale exceeds a critical value. We then study
the fluctuation spectra about the static configuration and show that the exact
non BPS solutions are unstable below the critical value. We have identified the
tachyonic degrees as well as massless moduli degrees. We then discuss the
physical meaning of the moduli degrees and construct exact time-dependent
vortex configurations where each vortex moves independently. We finally give
the moduli description of the vortices and show that the matrix nature of
moduli coordinates naturally emerges.
