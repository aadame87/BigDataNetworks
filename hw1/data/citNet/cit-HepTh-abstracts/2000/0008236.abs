  Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and axial anomaly are studied in the
light-front formulation. The existence of multiple vacua and a Nambu-Goldstone
boson, both related to dynamical fermion zero modes, are demonstrated within a
simple sigma model with fermions. The Weyl gauge formulation and a consistent
gauge invariant point-splitting regularization, which includes the light front
time, are crucial for obtaining the anomaly in the massive Schwinger model and
QED(3+1).
