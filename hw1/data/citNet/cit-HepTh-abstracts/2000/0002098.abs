  A continuum of monopole, dyon and black hole solutions exist in the
Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. Their
structure is studied in detail. The solutions are classified by non-Abelian
electric and magnetic charges and the ADM mass. The stability of the solutions
which have no node in non-Abelian magnetic fields is established. There exist
critical spacetime solutions which terminate at a finite radius, and have
universal behavior. The moduli space of the solutions exhibits a fractal
structure as the cosmological constant approaches zero.
