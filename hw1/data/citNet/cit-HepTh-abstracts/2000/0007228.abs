  Static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat solutions to the U(1)
Born-Infeld theory coupled to gravity and to a dilaton are investigated. The
dilaton enters in such a way that the theory is $SL(2,R)$- symmetric for a unit
value of the dilaton coupling constant. We find globally regular solutions for
any value of the effective coupling which is the ratio of the gravitational and
dilaton couplings; they form a continuous sequence labeled by the sole free
parameter of the local solution near the origin. The allowed values of this
parameter are bounded from below, and, as the limiting value is approached, the
mass and the dilaton charge rise indefinitely and tend to a strict equality (in
suitable units). Together with the electric charge they saturate the BPS bound
of the corresponding linear U(1) theory. Beyond this boundary the solutions
become compact (singular), while the limiting solution at the exact boundary
value is non-compact and non-asymptotically flat. The black holes in this
theory exist for any value of the event horizon radius and also form a sequence
labelled by a continuously varying parameter restricted to a finite interval.
The singularity inside the black hole exhibits a power-law mass inflation.
