  The ratios of the masses of D(p-d) branes to the masses of Dp in open bosonic
string field theory are computed within the modified level truncation
approximation of Moeller, Sen and Zweibach. At the lowest non-trivial
truncation requiring the addition of new primary states, we find evidence of
rapid convergence to the expected result for 1<d<7 providing additional
evidence for the consistency of this approximation.
