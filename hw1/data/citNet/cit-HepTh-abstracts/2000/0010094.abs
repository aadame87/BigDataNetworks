Title: Boundary bound states in integrable quantum field theories
Authors: E. Corrigan
Comments: 9 pages, JHEP proceedings style, talk presented at the TMR conference
  "Nonperturbative Quantum Effects 2000"
\\
  The purpose of this talk is to sketch some recent progress which has been
made in calculating non-perturbatively the reflection factors for the
sinh-Gordon model restricted to a half-line by integrable boundary conditions.
The essential idea is to calculate the energy spectrum of boundary breathers in
two independent ways; firstly by using the boundary bootstrap and secondly by
quantizing the classical solutions corresponding to boundary breathers.
Comparing these two calculations provides a way to determine the dependence of
the reflection factors on the parameters introduced into the Lagrangian by the
boundary conditions. The basic idea is illustrated using a massive free scalar
field with a linear boundary condition confining it to a half-line.
