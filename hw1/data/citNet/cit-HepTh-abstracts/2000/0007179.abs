  We summarize the work done in connecting Green's functions in a different
classes of gauges and its applications to the problems in the axial gauges.The
procedure adopted uses finite field-dependent BRS [FFBRS] transformations to
connect axial and the Lorentz type gauges.These transformations preserve the
vacuum expectation of gauge-invariant observables explicitly. We discuss the
applications of these ideas to the axial gauge pole problem and to the
preservation of the Wilson loop and the thermal Wilson loop.
