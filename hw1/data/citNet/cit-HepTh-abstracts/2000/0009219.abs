  The study of boundary conditions in rational conformal field theories is not
only physically important. It also reveals a lot on the structure of the theory
``in the bulk''. The same graphs classify both the torus and the cylinder
partition functions and provide data on their hidden ``quantum symmetry''. The
Ocneanu triangular cells -- the 3j-symbols of these symmetries, admit various
interpretations and make a link between different problems.
