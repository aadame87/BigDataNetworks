  Extending the seminal work of Bilal and Gervais, we construct a tachyon-free,
modular invariant partition function for critical superstrings on
four-dimensional Minkowski x two-dimensional black hole. This model may be
thought of as an SL(2,R)/U(1) version of Gepner models and corresponds to a
conifold point on the moduli space of Calabi-Yau compactifications. We directly
deal with N=2, c=9 unitary superconformal characters. Modular invariance is
achieved by requiring the string to have a momentum along an extra noncompact
direction, in agreement with the picture of singular CFTs advocated by Witten.
The four-dimensional massless spectrum coincides with that of the tensionless
strings, suggesting a possible dual description of type II strings on a
conifold in terms of two intersecting NS5-branes. An interesting relation to
D=6, N=4 gauged supergravity is also discussed.
