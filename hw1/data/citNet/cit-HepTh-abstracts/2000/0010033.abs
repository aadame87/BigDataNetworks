  The quantum-mechanical many-body system with the potential proportional to
the pairwise inverse-square distance possesses a strong-weak coupling duality.
Based on this duality, particle and/or quasiparticle states are described as
SU(1,1) coherent states. The constructed quasiparticle states are of
hierarchical nature.
