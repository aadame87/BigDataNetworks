  We consider a spacetime formed by several pieces having common timelike
boundary which plays the role of a junction between them. We establish junction
conditions for fields of various spin and derive the resulting laws of wave
propagation through the junction, which turn out to be quite similar for fields
of all spins. As an application, we consider the case of branching
four-dimensional spacetime that may arise in the context of the theory of
quantum creation of a closed universe on the background of a big mother
universe. The theory developed can also be applied to brane-world models and to
the superstring theory.
