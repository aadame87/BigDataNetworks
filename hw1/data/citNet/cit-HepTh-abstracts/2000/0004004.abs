  We study the evaporation of black holes in space-times with extra dimensions
of size L. We first obtain a potential which describes the expected behaviors
of very large and very small black holes and then show that a (first order)
phase transition, possibly signaled by an outburst of energy, occurs in the
system when the horizon shrinks below L from a larger value. This is related to
both a change in the topology of the horizon and the restoring of the
translational symmetry along the extra dimensions.
