Title: Logarithmic CFT on the Boundary and the World-Sheet
Authors: Alex Lewis
Comments: 19 pages, Latex

  The correspondences between logarithmic operators in the CFTs on the boundary
of AdS_3 and on the world-sheet and dipole fields in the bulk are studied using
the free field formulation of the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZNW model. We find that
logarithmic operators on the boundary are related to operators on the
world-sheet which are in indecomposable representations of SL(2). The
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation is used to determine the conditions for those
representations to appear in the operator product expansions of the model.
