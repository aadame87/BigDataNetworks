  This review is based on two lectures given at the 2000 TMR school in Torino.
We discuss two main themes: i) Moyal-type deformations of gauge theories, as
emerging from M-theory and open string theories, and ii) the noncommutative
geometry of finite groups, with the explicit example of Z_2, and its
application to Kaluza-Klein gauge theories on discrete internal spaces.
