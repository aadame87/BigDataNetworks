  We investigate the Poisson-Sigma model on the classical and quantum level. In
the classical analysis we show how this model includes various known
two-dimensional field theories. Then we perform the calculation of the path
integral in a general gauge, and demonstrate that the derived partition
function reduces to the familiar form in the case of 2d Yang-Mills theory.
