  We consider a class of higher order corrections with arbitrary power $n$ of
the curvature tensor to the standard gravity action in arbitrary space-time
dimension $D$. The corrections are in the form of Euler densities and are
unique at each $n$ and $D$. We present a generating functional and an explicit
form of the corresponding conserved energy-momentum tensors. The case of
conformally flat metrics is discussed in detail. We show that this class of
corrections allows for domain wall solutions since, despite the presence of
higher powers of the curvature tensor, the singularity structure at the wall is
of the same type as in the standard gravity. However, models with higher order
corrections have larger set of domain wall solutions and the existence of these
solutions no longer depends on the presence of cosmological constants. We find
for example that the Randall-Sundrum scenario can be realized without any need
for bulk and/or brane cosmological constant.
