Title: Warped Compactifications and AdS/CFT

  In this talk we discuss two classes of examples of warped products of AdS
spaces in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The first class of
examples appears in the construction of dual Type I' string descriptions to
five dimensional supersymmetric fixed points with E_{N_f+1} global symmetry.
The background is obtained as the near horizon geometry of the D4-D8 brane
system in massive Type IIA supergravity. The second class of examples appears
when considering the N=2 superconformal theories defined on a 3+1 dimensional
hyperplane intersection of two sets of M5 branes. We use the dual string
formulations to deduce properties of these field theories.
