  We investigate the dynamics of Q-balls in one, two and three space
dimensions, using numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equations of
motion. We find that the dynamics of Q-balls is extremely complex, involving
processes such as charge transfer and Q-ball fission. We present results of
simulations which illustrate the salient features of 2-Q-ball interactions and
give qualitative arguments to explain them in terms of the evolution of the
time-dependent phases.
