  We consider exact solutions for static black holes localized on a three-brane
in five-dimensional gravity in the Randall-Sundrum scenario. We show that the
Reissner-Nordstrom metric is an exact solution of the effective Einstein
equations on the brane, re-interpreted as a black hole without electric charge,
but with instead a tidal 'charge' arising via gravitational effects from the
fifth dimension. The tidal correction to the Schwarzschild potential is
negative, which is impossible in general relativity, and in this case only one
horizon is admitted, located outside the Schwarzschild horizon. The solution
satisfies a closed system of equations on the brane, and describes the
strong-gravity regime. Current observations do not strongly constrain the tidal
charge, and significant tidal corrections could in principle arise in the
strong-gravity regime and for primordial black holes.
