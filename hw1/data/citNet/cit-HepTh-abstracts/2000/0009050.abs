  We consider the one-loop corrected geometry and thermodynamics of a rotating
BTZ black hole by way of a dimensionally reduced dilaton model. The analysis
begins with a comprehensive study of the non-extremal solution after which two
different methods are invoked to study the extremal case. The first approach
considers the extremal limit of the non-extremal calculations, whereas the
second treatment is based on the following conjecture: extremal and
non-extremal black holes ae qualitatively distinct entities. We show that only
the latter method yields regularity and consistency at the one-loop level. This
is suggestive of a generalized third law of thermodynamics that forbids
continuous evolution from non-extremal to extremal black hole geometries.
