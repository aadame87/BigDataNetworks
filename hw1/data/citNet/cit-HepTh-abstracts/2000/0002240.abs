  Four dimensional reflexive polyhedra encode the data for smooth Calabi-Yau
threefolds that are hypersurfaces in toric varieties, and have important
applications both in perturbative and in non-perturbative string theory. We
describe how we obtained all 473,800,776 reflexive polyhedra that exist in four
dimensions and the 30,108 distinct pairs of Hodge numbers of the resulting
Calabi-Yau manifolds. As a by-product we show that all these spaces (and hence
the corresponding string vacua) are connected via a chain of singular
transitions.
