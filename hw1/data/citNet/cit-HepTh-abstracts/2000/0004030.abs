  In this note we show how Ward identities may be derived for a quantum field
theory dual of a string theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular
associated with any gauge symmetry of the bulk supergravity theory there is a
corresponding constraint equation. Writing this constraint in Hamilton-Jacobi
form gives a generating functional for Ward identities in the dual QFT. We
illustrate the method by considering various examples.
