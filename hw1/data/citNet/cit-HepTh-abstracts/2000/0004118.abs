  We give a new criterion of quark confinement/deconfinement by deriving a
low-energy effective theory of QCD. The effective theory can explain Abelian
dominance in low-energy physics of QCD, especially, quark confinement. Finally,
we apply the above criterion to the large flavor QCD and discuss its phase
structure. The result suggests the existence of conformal phase.
