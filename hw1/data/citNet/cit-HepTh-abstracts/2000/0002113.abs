  We investigate the presence of chaos in a system of two real scalar fields
with discrete Z_2 x Z_2 symmetry. The potential that identify the system is
defined with a real parameter r and presents distinct features for r>0 and for
r<0. For static field configurations, the system supports two topological
sectors for r>0, and only one for r<0. Under the assumption of spatially
homogeneous fields, the system exhibts chaotic behavior almost everywhere in
parameter space. In particular a more complex dynamics appears for r>0; in this
case chaos can decrease for increasing energy, a fact that is absent for r<0.
