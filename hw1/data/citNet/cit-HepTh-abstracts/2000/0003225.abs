  Using the formal analogy between the Dick superstring inspired model of
ref.[6] and the problem of building of Eguchi Hanson metric in 4d N=2 harmonic
superspace (hs), we derive a general formula for the quark-quark interaction
potential V(r) including the Dick confining potential. The interquark potential
V(r) depends on the dilaton-gluon coupling and may be related to the
parameterization of confinement by the quark and gluon vacuum condensates. It
is also shown how the axion field may be incorporated in agreement with 10d
type IIB superstring requirements. Others features are also discussed.
