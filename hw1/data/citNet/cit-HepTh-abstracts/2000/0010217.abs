  We investigate further on the correspondence between branes on a Calabi-Yau
in the large volume limit and in the orbifold limit. We conjecture a new
procedure which improves computationally the McKay correspondence and prove it
in a non trivial example. We point out the relevance of helices and try to draw
some general conclusions about Beilinson theorem and McKay correspondence.
