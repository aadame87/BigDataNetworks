Title: Recent Progress in Superstring Theory
Author: John H. Schwarz
Comments: 13 pages; Talk presented at the Conference Quantization, Gauge
  Theory, and Strings dedicated to the memory of Professor Efim Fradkin and at
  the Ninth Marcel Grossmann Meeting (MG9)

  Superstring theory has continued to develop at a rapid clip in the past few
years. Following a quick review of some of the major discoveries prior to 1998,
this talk focuses on a few of the more recent developments. The topics I have
chosen to present are 1) the use of K-theory to classify conserved charges
carried by D-branes; 2) tachyon condensation on unstable D-brane systems; and
3) an introduction to noncommutative field theories and their solitons.
