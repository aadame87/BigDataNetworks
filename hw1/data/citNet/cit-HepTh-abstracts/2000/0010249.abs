  We prove that the Fourier transform of the exponential $e^{-\b V(R)}$ of the
{\bf static} interquark potential in QCD is positive. It has been shown by
Eliott Lieb some time ago that this property allows in the same limit of static
spin independent potential proving certain mass relation between baryons with
different quark flavors.
