  It is shown that the reduced particle dynamics of 2+1 dimensional gravity in
the maximally slicing gauge has hamiltonian form. This is proved directly for
the two body problem and for the three body problem by using the Garnier
equations for isomonodromic transformations. For a number of particles greater
than three the existence of the hamiltonian is shown to be a consequence of a
conjecture by Polyakov which connects the auxiliary parameters of the fuchsian
differential equation which solves the SU(1,1) Riemann-Hilbert problem, to the
Liouville action of the conformal factor which describes the space-metric. We
give the exact diffeomorphism which transforms the expression of the spinning
cone geometry in the Deser, Jackiw, 't Hooft gauge to the maximally slicing
gauge. It is explicitly shown that the boundary term in the action, written in
hamiltonian form gives the hamiltonian for the reduced particle dynamics. The
quantum mechanical translation of the two particle hamiltonian gives rise to
the logarithm of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a cone whose angular deficit
is given by the total energy of the system irrespective of the masses of the
particles thus proving at the quantum level a conjecture by 't Hooft on the two
particle dynamics. The quantum mechanical Green's function for the two body
problem is given.
