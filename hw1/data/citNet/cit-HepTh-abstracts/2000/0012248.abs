  We discuss some issues about the holographic interpretation of the compact
Randall-Sundrum model, which is conjectured to be dual to a 4d field theory
with non-linearly realized conformal symmetry. We make several checks of this
conjecture. In particular, we show that the radion couples conformally to a
background 4d metric. We also discuss the interpretation of the Goldberger-Wise
mechanism for stabilizing the radion. We consider situations where the
electroweak breaking stabilizes the radion and we discuss the issue of natural
conservation of flavor quantum numbers.
