  We use the correspondence between string states and local operators on the
world-sheet boundary defined by vertex operators in open string theory to put
in correspondence, holographically, the bosonic open string with the large N
limit of a mechanical system living on the world-sheet boundary. We give a
natural interpretation of this system in terms of a one-dimensional stochastic
process and show that the correspondence takes the form of a map between two
conformal field theories with central charge c=24 and c=1.
