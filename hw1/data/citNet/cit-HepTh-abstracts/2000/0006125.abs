  We propose a time-varying parameter $\underline{\alpha}$ for G\"{o}del metric
and an energy momentum tensor corresponding to this geometry is found. To
satisfy covariance arguments time-varying gravitational and cosmological term
are introduced. The ``Einstein's equation'' for this special evolution for the
Universe are written down where expansion, rotation and closed time-like curves
appear as a combination between standard model, G\"{o}del and steady state
properties are obtained.
