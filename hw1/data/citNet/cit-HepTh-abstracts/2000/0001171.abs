Authors: W. Dittrich and R. Shaisultanov
Comments: 9 pages
Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D62 (2000) 045024
\\
  Motivated by several recent papers on string-inspired calculations in QED, we
here present our own use of world-line techniques in order to calculate the
vacuum polarization and effective action in scalar and spinor QED with external
arbitrary constant electromagnetic field configuration.
