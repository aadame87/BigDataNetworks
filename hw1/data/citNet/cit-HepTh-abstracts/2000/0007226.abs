  It has recently been argued that D-branes in bosonic string theory can be
described as noncommutative solitons, outside whose core the tachyon is
condensed to its ground state. We conjecture that, in addition, the local U(1)
gauge symmetry is restored to a $U(\infty)$ symmetry in the vacuum outside this
core. We present new solutions obeying this boundary condition. The tension of
these solitons agrees exactly with the expected D-brane tension for arbitrary
noncommutativity parameter $\t$, which effectively becomes a dynamical
variable. The restored $U(\infty)$ eliminates unwanted extra modes which might
otherwise appear outside the soliton core.
