Title: Supersymmetric Noether Currents and Seiberg-Witten Theory
Authors: Alfredo Iorio
Comments: 135 pages, 3 figures, PhD thesis
\\
  A reliable method to construct Supersymmetric Noether currents is presented.
As the most important application the central charge of the N=2 Supersymmetric
Yang-Mills effective theory, known as Seiberg-Witten (SW) theory, is computed.
The analisys is carried out in the SW low energy U(1) effective Sector, as well
as in the SW high energy SU(2) effective Sector.
