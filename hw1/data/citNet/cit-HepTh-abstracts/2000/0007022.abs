  We have recently proposed a dynamical mechanism that may realize a flat
four-dimensional space time as a brane in type IIB superstring theory. A
crucial role is played by the phase of the chiral fermion integral associated
with the IKKT Matrix Theory, which is conjectured to be a nonperturbative
definition of type IIB superstring theory. We demonstrate our mechanism by
studying a simplified model, in which we find that a lower-dimensional brane
indeed appears dynamically. We also comment on some implications of our
mechanism on model building of the brane world.
