Title: Dynamics and topology of the gauge-invariant gauge field in two-color
  QCD
Authors: Kurt Haller
Comments: 6 pages. Contribution to Proceedings of Fifth Workshop on Quantum
  Chromodynamics at Villefranche-sur-Mer
\\
  A nonlinear integral equation that is responsible for the implementation of
the non-Abelian Gauss's law is applied to an investigation of the topological
features of two-color QCD and to a discussion of their relation to QCD
dynamics. We also draw a parallel between the nonuniqueness of the solutions of
the equations that govern the gauge-invariant gauge field and Gribov copies.
