  We reformulate the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model on the compactified AdS by
adding a term proportional to the area of the boundary to the usual gravity
action with a negative cosmological constant and show that gravity can still be
localized on the boundary without introducing singular brane sources. The
boundary conditions now follow from the field equations, which are obtained by
letting the induced metric vary on the boundary. This approach gives similar
modes that are obtained in [1] and clarifies the complementarity of the RS and
the AdS/CFT pictures. Normalizability of these modes is checked by an
inner-product in the space of linearized perturbations. The same conclusions
hold for a massless scalar field in the bulk.
