Title: How much can supergravity teach us about microscopic features of BPS
  black holes?
Authors: M. Bertolini and M. Trigiante
Comments: 17 pages, latex. To appear in the proceedings of the IX Marcel
  Grossman Meeting (Rome, July 2000), the TMR conference "Integrability
  Nonperturbative Effects And Symmetry In Quantum Field Theory" (Paris,
  September 2000) and the RTN conference ``The Quantum Structure of Spacetime
  and the Geometric Nature of Fundamental Interactions'' (Berlin, October 2000)

  We review recent results in the study of regular four dimensional BPS black
holes in toroidally compactified type II (or M) theory. We discuss the
generating solution for this kind of black holes, its microscopic
description(s), and compute the corresponding microscopic entropy. These
achievements, which provide a description of the fundamental degrees of freedom
accounting for the entropy of any regular BPS black hole in the theory under
consideration, are inscribed within a research project aimed to the study of
the microscopic properties of this kind of solutions in relation to U--duality
invariants computed on the corresponding macroscopic (supergravity)
description.
