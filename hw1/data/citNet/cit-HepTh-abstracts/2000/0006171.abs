  Some spatially homogeneous Bianchi type I cosmological models filled with
homogeneous ``electric'' $p$-form fields are shown to mimic the never-ending
oscillatory behaviour of generic string cosmologies established recently. The
validity of the ``Kasner-free-flights plus collisions-on-potential-walls''
picture is also illustrated in the case of known, non-chaotic, superstring
solutions.
