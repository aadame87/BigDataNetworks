  We derive an exact expression for the Fourier coefficients of elliptic genera
of Calabi-Yau manifolds. When applied to k-fold symmetric products of K3
surfaces the expression is well-suited to studying the AdS/CFT correspondence
on AdS3 x S3. The expression also elucidates an SL(2,Z) invariant phase diagram
for the D1/D5 system involving deconfining transitions in the limit as k goes
to infinity.
