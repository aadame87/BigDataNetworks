  Recent string theory developments suggest the necessity to understand
supersymmetric gauge theories non-perturbatively, in various dimensions. In
this work we show that there is a standard Hamiltonian formulation that
generates a finite and supersymmetric result at every order of the DLCQ
approximation scheme. We present this DLCQ renormalized Hamiltonian and solve
for the bound states and the wave functions to verify that it exactly
reproduces the large N SDLCQ results. We find that it has two novel features:
it automatically chooses the t'Hooft prescription for renormalizing the
singularities and it introduces irrelevant operators that serve to preserve the
supersymmetry and improve the convergence. This is a first step in extending
the advantages of SDLCQ to non-supersymmetric theories.
