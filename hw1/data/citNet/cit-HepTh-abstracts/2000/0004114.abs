  A globally consistent treatment of linearized gravity in the Randall-Sundrum
background with matter on the brane is formulated. Using a novel gauge, in
which the transverse components of the metric are non-vanishing, the brane is
kept straight. We analyze the gauge symmetries and identify the physical
degrees of freedom of gravity. Our results underline the necessity for
non-gravitational confinement of matter to the brane.
