  Conformal field theory of the D1/D5 system and superstrings on $AdS_3\times
S^3\times T^4$ is studied with particular attention to the world-sheet fields
corresponding to the $T^4$ part. A solution to the spacetime N=4 superconformal
symmetry doubling and other problems is proposed. It is argued that the
relevant spacetime symmetry should be based on the middle N=4 superconformal
algebra. It is discussed as to why this superconformal structure has been
missed so far.
