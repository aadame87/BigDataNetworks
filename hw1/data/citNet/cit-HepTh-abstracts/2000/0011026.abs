Title: Quantum Clifford Hopf Gebra for Quantum Field Theory
Authors: Bertfried Fauser
Comments: 10 pages, talk at the Symposium on Quantum Groups, GROUP23
  Conference, DUBNA, 2000
\\
  We give arguments for the necessity to employ Quantum Clifford Hopf Gebras in
quantum field theory. The role of the antipode is examined, Feynman diagrams
are re-interpreted as tangles of graphical calculus. Regularization due to the
design of convolution Hopf gebras is given as a program for further research.
