  Derivations of consistent equations of motion for the massive spin two field
interacting with gravity is reviewed. From the field theoretical point of view
the most general classical action describing consistent causal propagation in
vacuum Einstein spacetime is given. It is also shown that the massive spin two
field can be consistently described in arbitrary background by means of
lagrangian equations representing an infinite series in curvature. Within
string theory equations of motion for the massive spin two field coupled to
gravity is derived from the requirement of quantum Weyl invariance of the
corresponding two dimensional sigma-model. In the lowest order in string length
the effective equations of motion are demonstrated to coincide with the general
form of consistent equations derived in field theory.
