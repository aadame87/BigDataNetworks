  The zero momentum sectors in effective theories of QCD coupled to pseudoreal
(two colors) and real (adjoint) quarks have alternative descriptions in terms
of chiral orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices. Using this
correspondence, we compute correlation functions of Dirac operator eigenvalues
within a sector with an arbitrary topological charge in a presence of finite
quark masses of the order of the smallest Dirac eigenvalue. These novel
correlation functions, expressed in terms of Pfaffians, interpolate between
known results for the chiral and quenched limits as quark masses vary.
