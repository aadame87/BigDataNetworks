  It is known that noncommutative Yang-Mills is equivalent to IIB matrix model
with a noncommutative background, which is interpreted as a twisted reduced
model. In noncommutative Yang-Mills, long range interactions can be seen in
nonplanar diagrams after integrating high momentum modes. These interactions
can be understood as block-block interactions in the matrix model. Using this
relation, we consider long range interactions in noncommutative Yang-Mills
associated with fermionic backgrounds. Exchanges of gravitinos, which couple to
a supersymmetry current, are examined.
