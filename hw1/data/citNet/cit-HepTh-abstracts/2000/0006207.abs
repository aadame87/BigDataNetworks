  I consider Lagrangians which depend nonlocally in time but in such a way that
there is no mixing between times differing by more than some finite value
$\Delta t$. By considering these systems as the limits of ever higher
derivative theories I obtain a canonical formalism in which the coordinates are
the dynamical variable from $t$ to $t + {\Delta t}$. A simple formula for the
conjugate momenta is derived in the same way. This formalism makes apparent the
virulent instability of this entire class of nonlocal Lagrangians. As an
example, the formalism is applied to a nonlocal analog of the harmonic
oscillator.
