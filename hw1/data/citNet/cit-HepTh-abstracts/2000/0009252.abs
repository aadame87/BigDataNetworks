  Type I string theory provides eight classes of unstable D-brane systems. We
determine the gauge group and tachyon spectrum for each one, and thereby
describe the gauge symmetry breaking pattern in the low-energy world-volume
field theory. The topologies of the resulting coset vacuum manifolds are
related to the real K-theory groups KO^{-n}, extending the known relations
between the Type II classifying spaces BU and U and the complex K-theory groups
K^0 and K^{-1}. We also comment on the role of the background D9-branes.
