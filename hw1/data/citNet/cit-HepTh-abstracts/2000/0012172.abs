  It is shown that the never ending oscillatory behaviour of the generic
solution, near a cosmological singularity, of the massless bosonic sector of
superstring theory can be described as a billiard motion within a simplex in
9-dimensional hyperbolic space. The Coxeter group of reflections of this
billiard is discrete and is the Weyl group of the hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra
E$_{10}$ (for type II) or BE$_{10}$ (for type I or heterotic), which are both
arithmetic. These results lead to a proof of the chaotic (``Anosov'') nature of
the classical cosmological oscillations, and suggest a ``chaotic quantum
billiard'' scenario of vacuum selection in string theory.
