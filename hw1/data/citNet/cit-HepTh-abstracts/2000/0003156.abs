  I contemplate the possibility that the mismatch between the maximally
symmetric point (the free fermionic point) and the strictly self-dual point in
the Narain moduli space plays a role in the string vacuum selection. The role
of self-duality in the recent formulation of quantum mechanics from an
equivalence postulate, and the new perspective that it offers on the
foundations of quantum gravity and the origin of mass, are discussed.
