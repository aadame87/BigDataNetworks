Title: The Structure of D2-Branes in the Presence of an RR field
Authors: D.K. Park, S. Tamaryan, H.J.W. M\"uller-Kirsten
Comments: 11 pages, 2 postscript figures, v2 a significantly revised including

\\
  A Born--Infeld theory describing a $D2$--brane coupled to a 3--form RR
potential is reconsidered and a new type of static solution is obtained which
is even stable.
