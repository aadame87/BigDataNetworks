Title: Excision of `repulson' singularities: a spacetime result and its gauge
  theory analogue

\\
  We discuss spacetime singularity resolution in the context of the
gravity/gauge correspondence, for brane systems which give rise to gauge
theories with eight supercharges and no hypermultiplets. The discussion is
aimed at non-experts. Writeup of talk on hep-th/9911161 with C.V.Johnson and
J.Polchinski, given in various forms at: PASCOS-99, Aspen winter conference
`Way Beyond the Standard Models', Banff CIAR Gravity+Cosmology Programme
Meeting.
