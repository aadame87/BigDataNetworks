  We find a static solution to Einstein's field equations on a five-dimensional
orbifold with a compact S_1/Z_2 fifth direction and Poincare invariant 3+1
sections. The solution describes a theory with bulk cosmological constant and
3-branes at the orbifold fixed points which carry matter density and pressure
in addition to tension. The radius of the fifth dimension is determined by the
matter content of the branes. The ratio of the space and time components of the
metric depends on the fifth coordinate. Thus, the speed of propagation of
massless fields is path dependent. For example, bulk and brane fields propagate
with different speeds.
