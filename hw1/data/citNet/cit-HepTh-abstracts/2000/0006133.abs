  In a gravitational field, we analyze the Maxwell equations, the correponding
electromagnetic wave and continuity equations. A particular solution for
parellel electric and magnetic fields in a gravitational background is
presented. These solutions also satisfy the free-wave equations and the
phenomenology suggested by plasma physics.
