  We discuss the restructuring of the BPS spectrum which occurs on certain
submanifolds of the moduli/parameter space -- the curves of the marginal
stability (CMS) -- using quasiclassical methods. We argue that in general a
`composite' BPS soliton swells in coordinate space as one approaches the CMS
and that, as a bound state of two `primary' solitons, its dynamics in this
region is determined by non-relativistic supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Near
the CMS the bound state has a wave function which is highly spread out.
Precisely on the CMS the bound state level reaches the continuum, the composite
state delocalizes in coordinate space, and restructuring of the spectrum can
occur. We present a detailed analysis of this behavior in a two-dimensional N=2
Wess-Zumino model with two chiral fields, and then discuss how it arises in the
context of `composite' dyons near weak coupling CMS curves in N=2
supersymmetric gauge theories. We also consider cases where some states become
massless on the CMS.
