  We show that four-dimensional N=2 ungauged Einstein-Maxwell supergravity can
be embedded on the Randall-Sundrum 3-brane, as a consistent Kaluza-Klein
reduction of five-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity. In particular, this
allows us to describe four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black holes within
the Randall-Sundrum scenario. Using earlier results on the embedding of
five-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity in ten dimensions, we can then
describe the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell supergravity on the 3-brane, and
its solutions, from a type IIB viewpoint. We also show that the minimal
ungauged supergravities in D=5 and D=6 can be consistently embedded in the
half-maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravities in D=6 and D=7
respectively. These allow us to construct solutions including BPS black holes
and strings living in "Randall-Sundrum 4-branes," and BPS self-dual strings
living in "Randall-Sundrum 5-branes." We can also lift the embeddings to
ten-dimensional massive type IIA and D=11 supergravity respectively. In
particular, we obtain a solution describing the self-dual string living in the
world-volume of an M5-brane, which can be viewed as an open membrane ending on
the M5-brane.
