  We analyse the noncommutative U(1) sigma model, which arises from the vacuum
dynamics of the noncommutative charged tachyonic field. The sector of
``spherically symmetric'' excitations of the model is equivalent to a chain of
rotators. Classical solutions for this model are found, which are static and
``spherically symmetric'' in noncommutative spatial dimensions. The limit of
small noncommutativity reveals the presence of Polyakov vortices in the model.
A generalisation of the model to q-deformed space, which may serve as a
regularisation of the non-deformed model is also considered.
