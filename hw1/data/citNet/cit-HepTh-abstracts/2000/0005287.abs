  Some problems related to construction of the epsilon-expansion of
dimensionally regulated Feynman integrals are discussed. For certain classes of
diagrams, an arbitrary term of the epsilon-expansion can be expressed in terms
of log-sine integrals related to the polylogarithms. It is shown how the
analytic continuation of these functions can be constructed in terms of the
generalized Nielsen polylogarithms.
