  By looking at fractional Dp-branes of type IIA on T_4/Z_2 as wrapped branes
and by using boundary state techniques we construct the effective low-energy
action for the fields generated by fractional branes, build their world-volume
action and find the corresponding classical geometry. The explicit form of the
classical background is consistent only outside an enhancon sphere of radius
r_e, which encloses a naked singularity of repulson-type. The perturbative
running of the gauge coupling constant, dictated by the NS-NS twisted field
that keeps its one-loop expression at any distance, also fails at r_e.
