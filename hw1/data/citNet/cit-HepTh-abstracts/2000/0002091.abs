  A treatment of linearized gravity is given in the Randall-Sundrum background.
The graviton propagator is found in terms of the scalar propagator, for which
an explicit integral expression is provided. This reduces to the
four-dimensional propagator at long distances along the brane, and provides
estimates of subleading corrections. Asymptotics of the propagator off the
brane yields exponential falloff of gravitational fields due to matter on the
brane. This implies that black holes bound to the brane have a "pancake"-like
shape in the extra dimension, and indicates validity of a perturbative
treatment off the brane. Some connections with the AdS/CFT correspondence are
described.
