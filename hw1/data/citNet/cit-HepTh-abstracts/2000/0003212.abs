Title: Let's Baxterise

  We recall the concept of Baxterisation of an R-matrix, or of a monodromy
matrix, which corresponds to build, from one point in the $ R$-matrix parameter
space, the algebraic variety where the spectral parameter(s) live. We show that
the Baxterisation, which amounts to studying the iteration of a birational
transformation, is a ``win-win'' strategy: it enables to discard efficiently
the non-integrable situations, focusing directly on the two interesting cases
where the algebraic varieties are of the so-called ``general type'' (finite
order iteration) or are Abelian varieties (infinite order iteration). We
emphasize the heuristic example of the sixteen vertex model and provide a
complete description of the finite order iterations situations for the Baxter
model. We show that the Baxterisation procedure can be introduced in much
larger frameworks where the existence of some underlying Yang-Baxter structure
is not used: we Baxterise L-operators, local quantum Lax matrices, and quantum
Hamiltonians.
