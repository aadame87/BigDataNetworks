  The hypercharge-isospin-color symmetry of the standard model interaction is
drastically reduced to a remaining Abelian electromagnetic $\U(1)$-symmetry for
the particles. It is shown that such a symmetry reduction comes as a
consequence of the central correlation in the internal group as represented by
the standard fields where the hypercharge properties are given by the central
isospin-color properties. A maximal diagonalizable symmetry subgroup (Cartan
torus) of the interaction group for the particles as eigenvectors has to
discard either color (confinement) or isospin. An additional diagonalization
for the external spin properties which come centrally correlated with the
isospin properties enforces the weak isospin breakdown.
