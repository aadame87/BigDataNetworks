Title: Rotations and e, $\nu$ Propagators, Part I

  Rotation symmetry is less constraining than space-time symmetry. The free
electron propagator is a projection operator that we show can be constructed
from rotation symmetric projection operators. Rotation-based identifications of
time, space, energy, momentum, polarization matrices, and the positron
hypothesis are determined by the constraints that turn rotation symmetric
projection operators into the electron propagator.
