  We present a simple derivation of vector supersymmetry transformations for
topological field theories of Schwarz- and Witten-type. Our method is similar
to the derivation of BRST-transformations from the so-called horizontality
conditions or Russian formulae. We show that this procedure reproduces in a
concise way the known vector supersymmetry transformations of various
topological models and we use it to obtain some new transformations of this
type for 4d topological YM-theories in different gauges.
