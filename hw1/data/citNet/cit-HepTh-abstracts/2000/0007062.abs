  We give a prescription for calculating the holographic Weyl anomaly in
arbitrary dimension within the framework based on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
proposed by de Boer, Verlinde and Verlinde. A few sample calculations are made
and shown to reproduce the results that are obtained to this time with a
different method. We further discuss continuum limits, and argue that the
holographic renormalization group may describe the renormalized trajectory in
the parameter space. We also clarify the relationship of the present formalism
to the analysis carried out by Henningson and Skenderis.
