Title: What does the string/gauge correspondence teach us about Wilson loops?
Author: Jacob Sonnenschein (TAU)

  In these lectures we describe the attempt to extract the expectation values
of Wilson loops from the string/gauge correspondence. We start with the
original calculation in $AdS_5$. It is then extended to the non-conformal
background of $D_p$ in the near horizon limit. We discuss the computation at
finite temperature. Supergravity models that admit confinement in 3d and 4d are
described. A theorem that determines the classical values of loops associated
with a generalized background is derived.In particular we determine sufficient
conditions for confining behavior. We then apply the theorem to various string
models including type 0 ones. We describe an attempt to go beyond the classical
string picture by incorporating quadratic quantum fluctuations. In particular
we address the BPS configuration of a single quark, the supersymmetric
determinant of $AdS_5\times S^$ and a setup that corresponds to a confining
gauge theory. We determine the form of the Wilson loop for actions that include
non trivial $B_{\mu\nu}$ field. The issue of an exact determination of the
value of the stringy Wilson loop is discussed. We end with a brief review of
the baryons from the string/gauge correspondence Lectures presented in the
``Advanced School on Supersymmetry in the theories of fields, strings and
branes'' Santiago de Compostela-99.
