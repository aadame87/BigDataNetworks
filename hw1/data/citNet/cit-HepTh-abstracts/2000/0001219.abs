  Softly broken dual magnetic theory of N=1 supersymmetric SU(N_c) QCD with N_f
flavours is investigated with the inclusion of trilinear coupling term of
scalar fields in the case of N_f>N_c+1. It is found that the trilinear soft
supersymmetric breaking term greatly change the phase and the vacuum structure.
