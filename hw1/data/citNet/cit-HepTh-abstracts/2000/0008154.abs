  In this article we explain discrete torsion. Put simply, discrete torsion is
the choice of orbifold group action on the B field. We derive the
classification H^2(G, U(1)), we derive the twisted sector phases appearing in
string loop partition functions, we derive M. Douglas's description of discrete
torsion for D-branes in terms of a projective representation of the orbifold
group, and we outline how the results of Vafa-Witten fit into this framework.
In addition, we discover some new degrees of freedom that appear in describing
orbifold group actions on B fields, in addition to those classified by H^2(G,
U(1)), and explain how these new degrees of freedom appear in terms of twisted
sector contributions to partition functions and in terms of orbifold group
actions on D-brane worldvolumes. This paper represents a technically simplified
version of prior papers by the author on discrete torsion. We repeat here
technically simplified versions of results from those papers, and have included
some new material.
