  The Coulomb gauge has at least two advantadges over other gauge choices in
that bound states between quarks and studies of confinement are easier to
understand in this gauge. However, perturbative calculations, namely Feynman
loop integrations are not well-defined (there are the so-called energy
integrals) even within the context of dimensional regularization. Leibbrandt
and Williams proposed a possible cure to such a problem by splitting the
space-time dimension into $D=\omega+\rho$, i.e., introducing a specific one
parameter $\rho$ to regulate the energy integrals. The aim of our work is to
apply negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) to the Coulomb gauge
integrals using the recipe of split-dimension parameters and present complete
results -- finite and divergent parts -- to the one and two-loop level for
arbitrary exponents of propagators and dimension.
