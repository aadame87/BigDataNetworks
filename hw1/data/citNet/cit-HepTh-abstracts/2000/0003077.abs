  In this work, we suggest a view-point that leads to an intrinsic mass scale
in Quantum Field Theories. This view-point is fairly independent of dynamical
details of a QFT and does not rely on any particular framework to go beyond the
standard Model. We use the setting of the nonlocal quantum field theories NLQFT
with a finite scale parameter Lambda, which are unitary for finite Lambda. We
propose that the condition 0 < Z < 1 [wherever proven] can be rigorously
implemented/imposed in such theories and that it implies the existence of a
mass scale Lambda that can be determined from this condition. We derive the
nonlocal analogue of the above relation [which is a finite relation in NLQFT]
and demonstrate that it can be arrived at only from general principles. We
further propose that the nonlocal formulation should be looked as an effective
field theory that incorporates the effect of dynamics beyond an energy scale
and which breaks at the intrinsic scale Lambda so obtained. Beyond this scale
it should be replaced by another [perhaps, a more fundamental] theory. We
provide a heuristic justification for this view-point.
