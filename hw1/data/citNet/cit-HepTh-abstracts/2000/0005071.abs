  A formulation of Skyrme model as an embedded gauge theory with the constraint
deformed away from the spherical geometry is proposed. The gauge invariant
formulation is obtained firstly generalizing the intrinsic geometry of the
model and then converting the constraint to first-class through an iterative
Wess-Zumino procedure. The gauge invariant model is quantized via Dirac method
for first-class system. A perturbative calculation provides new free parameters
related to deformation that improve the energy spectrum obtained in earlier
approaches.
