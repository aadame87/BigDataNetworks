  For the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) invariant extended action for any
gauge theory, there exists another off-shell nilpotent symmetry. For linear
gauges, it can be elevated to a symmetry of the quantum theory and used in the
construction of the quantum effective action. Generalizations for nonlinear
gauges and actions with higher order ghost terms are also possible.
