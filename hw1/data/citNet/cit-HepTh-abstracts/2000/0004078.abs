  A detailed study of the charge spectrum of three dimensional Abelian
Topological Massive Gauge Theory (TMGT) is given. When this theory is defined
on a manifold with two disconnected boundaries there are induced chiral
Conformal Field Theories (CFT's) on the boundaries which can be interpreted as
the left and right sectors of closed strings. We show that Narain constraints
on toroidal compactification (integer, even, self-dual momentum lattice) have a
natural interpretation in purely three dimensional terms. This is an important
result which is necessary to construct toroidal compactification and heterotic
string from Topological Membrane (TM) approach to string theory. We also derive
the block structure of $c=1$ Rational Conformal Field Theory (RCFT) from the
three dimensional gauge theory.
