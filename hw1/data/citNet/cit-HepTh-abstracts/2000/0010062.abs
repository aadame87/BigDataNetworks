  This is a short review on the thermal, spectral representation in the
real-time version of the finite temperature quantum field theory. After
presenting a clear derivation of the spectral representation, we discuss the
properties of its spectral function. Two applications of this representation
are then considered. One is the solution of the Dyson equation for the thermal
propagator. The other is the formulation of the QCD sum rules at finite
temperature.
