Title: Beyond Eikonal Scattering in M(atrix)-Theory
Authors: Robert Helling (AEI Potsdam)
Report-no: AEI-2000-048
\\
  We study the problem of more general kinematics for the finite N
M(atrix)-Model than the simple straight line motion that has been used before.
This is supposed to be related to momentum transferring processes in the dual
super-gravity description. We find a negative result for classical,
perturbative processes and discuss briefly the possibility of instianton like
quantum mechanical tunneling processes.
