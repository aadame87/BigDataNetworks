  Combining a local gauge principle, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and the
principles of General Relativity in a particular way, we obtain the
mathematical framework for the formulation of a new type of variational
principle in space-time. The postulate that physics can be formulated within
this framework is called the "principle of the fermionic projector."
  The principle of the fermionic projector is introduced and discussed. We
describe a limiting process with which our variational principles can be
analyzed in the setting of relativistic quantum mechanics and classical field
theory.
