  We show that exponentially large warp factor hierarchies can be dynamically
generated in supersymmetric compactifications. The compactification we consider
is the supersymmetric extension of the Randall-Sundrum model. The crucial issue
is the stabilization of the radius modulus for large warp factor. The
stabilization sector we employ is very simple, consisting of two pure
Yang--Mills sectors, one in the bulk and the other localized on a brane. The
only fine-tuning required in our model is the cancellation of the cosmological
constant, achieved by balancing the stabilization energy against supersymmetry
breaking effects. Exponentially large warp factors arise naturally, with no
very large or small input parameters. To perform the analysis, we derive the
4-dimensional effective theory for the supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum model,
with a careful treatment of the radius modulus. The manifestly (off-shell)
supersymmetric form of this effective lagrangian allows a straightforward and
systematic treatment of the non-perturbative dynamics of the stabilization
sector.
