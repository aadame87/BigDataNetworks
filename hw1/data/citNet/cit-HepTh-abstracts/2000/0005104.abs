  Probabilities of crossing on same-spin clusters, seen as order parameters,
have been introduced recently for the critical 2d Ising model by Langlands,
Lewis and Saint-Aubin. We extend Cardy's ideas, introduced for percolation, to
obtain an ordinary differential equation of order 6 for the horizontal crossing
probability pih. Due to the identity pih(r)+pih(1/r)=1, the function pih must
lie in a 3-dimensional subspace. New measurements of pih are made for 40 values
of the aspect ratio r (r in [0.1443,6.928]). These data are more precise than
those obtained by Langlands et al as the 95%-confidence interval is brought to
4x10^{-4}. A 3-parameter fit using these new data determines the solution of
the differential equation. The largest gap between this solution and the 40
data is smaller than 4x10^{-4}. The probability pihv of simultaneous horizontal
and vertical crossings is also treated.
