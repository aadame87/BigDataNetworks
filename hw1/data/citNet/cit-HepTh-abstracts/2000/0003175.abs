  These lectures discuss some of the general issues in developing a
phenomenology for Superstring Theory/M Theory. The focus is on the question:
how might one obtain robust, generic predictions. For example, does the theory
predict low energy supersymmetry breaking? In the course of these explorations,
basics of supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking, string moduli, cosmological
issues, and other questions are addressed. The notion of approximate moduli and
their possible role plays a central role in the discussion.
