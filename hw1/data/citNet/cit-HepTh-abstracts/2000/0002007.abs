  We investigate the conformal and superconformal properties of a
non-relativistic spinning particle propagating in a curved background coupled
to a magnetic field and with a scalar potential. We derive the conditions on
the couplings for a large class of such systems which are necessary in order
their actions admit conformal and superconformal symmetry. We find that some of
these conditions can be encoded in the conformal and holomorphic geometry of
the background. Several new examples of conformal and superconformal models are
also given.
