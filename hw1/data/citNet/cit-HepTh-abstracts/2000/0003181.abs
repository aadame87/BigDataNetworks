  It is shown that the method of nonlinear realization of local supersymmetry
being applied to the n=(1,1) superconformal symmetry allows one reduce the new
version of the super-Liouville equation to the ordinary one owing to the
relaxation of the auxiliary equation of motion fixing the gauge parameters.
