  The relativistic scattering of a spin-1/2 particle from an infinitely long
solenoid is considered in the framework of covariant perturbation theory. The
first order term agrees with the corresponding term in the series expansion of
the exact amplitude, and second order term vanishes, thus proving that Born
approximation is consistent.
