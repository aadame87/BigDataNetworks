  We review some aspects of the D1/D5 system of type IIB string theory and the
associated five dimensional black hole. We include a pedagogical discussion of
the construction of relevant classical solutions in supergravity. We discuss
the gauge theory and the conformal field theory relevant to D-brane description
of these systems. In order to discuss Hawking radiation we are automatically
led to a discussion of near-horizon geometries and their relation to gauge
theories and conformal field theories. We show how inputs from AdS/CFT
correspondence resolve some earlier puzzles regarding Hawking radiation.
Besides the D1/D5 system, we include a brief discussion of some
nonsupersymmetric systems which show unexpected agreement between supergravity
and perturbative brane/string computations. We also comment briefly on possible
implications of the AdS/CFT relation for the correspondence principle and for
the principle of black hole complementarity.
