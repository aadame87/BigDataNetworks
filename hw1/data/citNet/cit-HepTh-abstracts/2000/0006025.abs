  Supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models are formulated as gauge theories.
Auxiliary chiral superfields are introduced to impose supersymmetric
constraints of F-type. Target manifolds defined by F-type constraints are
always non-compact. In order to obtain nonlinear sigma models on compact
manifolds, we have to introduce gauge symmetry to eliminate the degrees of
freedom in non-compact directions. All supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models
defined on the hermitian symmetric spaces are successfully formulated as gauge
theories.
