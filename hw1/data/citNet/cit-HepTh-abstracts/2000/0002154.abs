  We present a detailed analysis of a scalar conformal four-point function
obtained from AdS/CFT correspondence. We study the scalar exchange graphs in
AdS and discuss their analytic properties. Using methods of conformal partial
wave analysis, we present a general procedure to study conformal four-point
functions in terms of exchanges of scalar and tensor fields. The logarithmic
terms in the four-point functions are connected to the anomalous dimensions of
the exchanged fields. Comparison of the results from AdS graphs with the
conformal partial wave analysis, suggests a possible general form for the
operator product expansion of scalar fields in the boundary CFT.
