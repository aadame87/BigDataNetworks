  Description of the spectrum of fluctuations around a commutative vacuum
solution, as well as around a solution with degenerate commutator in IIB matrix
model is given in terms of supersymmetric Yang-Mills (YM) model. We construct
explicitly the map from Hermitian matrices to YM fields and study the
dependence of the spectrum and respective YM model on the symmetries of the
solution. The gauge algebra of the YM model is shown to contain local
reparameterisation algebra as well as Virasoro one.
