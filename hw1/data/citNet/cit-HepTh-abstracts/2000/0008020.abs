  In this paper we consider the worldsheet of superstring as a noncommutative
space. Some additional terms can be added to the superstring action, such that
for ordinary worldsheet they are zero. Expansion of this extended action up to
the first order of the noncommutativity parameter, leads to the new
supersymmetric action for string. For the closed superstring, we obtain the
boundary state that describes a brane. From the open string point of view, the
new boundary conditions on the worldsheet bosons, generalize the
noncommutativity of spacetime. Finally, we suggest some definitions for the
noncommutativity parameter of superstring worldsheet.
