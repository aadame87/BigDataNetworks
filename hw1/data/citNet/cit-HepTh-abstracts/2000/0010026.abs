  We revisit the non-linear BPS equation: the Dirac monopole of the Born-Infeld
theory in the B-field background. The rotation used in our previous papers to
discuss the scalar field by transforming the BPS equation into a linear one is
extended to the case of gauge field. We also find that this transformation is a
symmetry of the action. Moreover using the Legendre-dual formalism we present a
simple expression of the BPS equation.
