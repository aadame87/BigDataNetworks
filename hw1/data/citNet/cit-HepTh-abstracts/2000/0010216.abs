  An approach is proposed enabling to effectively describe the behaviour of a
bosonic system. The approach uses the quantum group $GL_{p,q}(2)$ formalism. In
effect, considering a bosonic Hamiltonian in terms of the $GL_{p,q}(2)$
generators, it is shown that its thermodynamic properties are connected to
deformation parameters $p$ and $q$. For instance, the average number of
particles and the pressure have been computed. If $p$ is fixed to be the same
value for $q$, our approach coincides perfectly with some results developed
recently in this subject. The ordinary results, of the present system, can be
found when we take the limit $p=q=1$.
