  Using a one-loop renormalization group improvement for the effective
potential in the Higgs model of electrodynamics with electrically and
magnetically charged scalar fields, we argue for the existence of a triple
(critical) point in the phase diagram ($\lambda_{run}, g_{run}^4$), where
$\lambda_{run}$ is the renormalised running selfinteraction constant of the
Higgs scalar monopoles and $g_{run}$ is their running magnetic charge. This
triple point is a boundary point of three first-order phase transitions in the
dual sector of the Higgs scalar electrodynamics: The "Coulomb" and two
confinement phases meet together at this critical point. Considering the
arguments for the one-loop approximation validity in the region of parameters
around the triple point A we have obtained the following triple point values of
the running couplings: $(\lambda_{(A)}, g^2_{(A)})\approx(-13.4; 18.6)$, which
are independent of the electric charge influence and two--loop corrections to
$g^2_{run}$ with high accuracy of deviations. At the triple point the mass of
monopoles is equal to zero. The corresponding critical value of the electric
fine structure constant turns out to be $\alpha_{crit} =
\pi/g^2_{(A)}\approx{0.17}$ by the Dirac relation. This value is close to the
$\alpha_{crit}^{lat}\approx{0.20\pm 0.015}$, which in a U(1) lattice gauge
theory corresponds to the phase transition between the "Coulomb" and
confinement phases. In our theory for $\alpha \ge \alpha_{crit}$ there are two
phases for the confinement of the electrically charged particles. The results
of the present paper are very encouraging for the Anti--grand unification
theory which was developed previously as a realistic alternative to SUSY GUTs.
The paper is also devoted to the discussion of this problem.
