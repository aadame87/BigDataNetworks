  We investigate the open string modes, describing the world-volume of a D
p-brane, for its cyclic symmetry in presence of a magnetic field. It is argued
that the constant coordinate modes receive non-perturbative correction. We show
that they introduce the notion of noncommutativity on the D p-brane
world-volume and make it UV-renormalizable. An analogy between cyclic symmetry
($\a'$-corrections) and the noncommutative geometry ($\Theta_A$-corrections) is
presented to explain some of the unusual IR phenomena often noticed in a
noncommutative theory.
