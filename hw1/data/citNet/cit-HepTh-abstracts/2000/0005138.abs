  It is known that noncommutative Yang-Mills theory with periodical boundary
conditions on torus at the rational value of the noncommutativity parameter is
Morita equivalent to the ordinary Yang-Mills theory with twisted boundary
conditions on dual torus. We present simple derivation of this fact. We
describe one-to-one correspondence between and gauge invariant observables in
these two theories. In particular, we show that under Morita map Polyakov loops
in the ordinary YM theory go to the open noncommutative Wilson loops discovered
by Ishibashi, Iso, Kawai and Kutazawa.
