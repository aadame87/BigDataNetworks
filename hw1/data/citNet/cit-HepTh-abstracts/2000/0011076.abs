  We discuss the covariant formulation of local field theories described by the
Companion Lagrangian associated with p-branes. The covariantisation is shown to
be useful for clarifying the geometrical meaning of the field equations and
also their relation to the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the standard
Dirac-Born-Infeld theory.
