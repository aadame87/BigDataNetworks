  We compute the renormalized four-point coupling in the 2d Ising model using
transfer-matrix techniques. We greatly reduce the systematic uncertainties
which usually affect this type of calculations by using the exact knowledge of
several terms in the scaling function of the free energy. Our final result is
g4=14.69735(3).
