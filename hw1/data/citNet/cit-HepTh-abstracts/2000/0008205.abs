  We investigate N=4 noncommutative super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. We compute
the one-loop four gauge boson scattering amplitude on parallel Dp-branes, and
find the corresponding contribution to the noncommutative SYM one-loop action
in a momentum expansion. The result is somewhat surprising. We find that while
the planar diagram can be written using the usual *-product, the contributions
from nonplanar diagrams in general involve additional structure beyond the
*-product, arising from the nontrivial worldsheet correlations surviving the
field theory limit. To each nonplanar diagram, depending on the number n of
external vertex operator insertions on each boundary, there is a corresponding
*_n n-ary operation. We further find that it is no longer possible to write
down an off-shell gauge invariant one-loop effective action using the
noncommutative field strength defined at tree-level.
