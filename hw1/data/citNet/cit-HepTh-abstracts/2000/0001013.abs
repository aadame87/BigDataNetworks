Title: Gravity and the Newtonian limit in the Randall-Sundrum model
Authors: Rainer Dick, Dzo Mikulovicz
Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, sign changed and references added. We have also
  appended a remark on the compatibility of the 4D Poincare invariant metric of
  Randall and Sundrum with the boundary equations

  We point out that the gravitational evolution equations in the
Randall-Sundrum model appear in a different form than hitherto assumed. As a
consequence, the model yields a correct Newtonian limit in a novel manner.
