  If there is a single underlying "theory of everything" which in some limits
of its "moduli space" reduces to the five weakly coupled string theories in
10D, and 11D SUGRA, then it is possible that all six of them have some common
domain of validity and that they are in the same universality class, in the
sense that the 4D low energy physics of the different theories is the same. We
call this notion String Universality. This suggests that the true vacuum of
string theory is in a region of moduli space equally far (in some sense) from
all perturbative theories, most likely around the self-dual point with respect
to duality symmetries connecting them. We estimate stringy non-perturbative
effects from wrapped brane instantons in each perturbative theory, show how
they are related by dualities, and argue that they are likely to lead to moduli
stabilization only around the self-dual point. We argue that moduli
stabilization should occur near the string scale, and SUSY breaking should
occur at a much lower intermediate scale, and that it originates from different
sources. We discuss the problems of moduli stabilization and SUSY breaking in
currently popular scenarios, explain why these problems are generic, and
discuss how our scenario can evade them. We show that String Universality is
not inconsistent with phenomenology but that it is in conflict with some
popular versions of brane world scenarios.
