  This is a short review of the relation between the Reduced Models and
Noncommutative Yang-Mills Theories (NCYM) based on the work done in
collaboration with J. Ambjorn, J. Nishimura and R. Szabo. Contents: 1.Twisted
Eguchi-Kawai model (TEK), 2.Mapping onto NCYM, 3.Morita equivalence,
4.Fundamental matter, 5.Wilson loops in NCYM, 6.D-brane interpretation. Talk
given at the 11th International Seminar "Quarks'2000", Pushkin, Russia, May
13-21, 2000 and the E.S.Fradkin Memorial Conference, Moscow, June 5-10, 2000.
