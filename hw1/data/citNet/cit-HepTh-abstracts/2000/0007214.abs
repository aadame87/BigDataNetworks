  The supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model on a half-line with integrable boundary
conditions is considered perturbatively to verify conjectured exact reflection
factors to one loop order. Propagators for the boson and fermion fields
restricted to a half-line contain several novel features and are developed as
prerequisites for the calculations.
