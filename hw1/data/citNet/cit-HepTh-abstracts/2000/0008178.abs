  We show that it is possible to construct a consistent model describing a
current-carrying cosmic string endowed with torsion. The torsion contribution
to the gravitational force and geodesics of a test-particle moving around the
SCCS are analyzed. In particular, we point out two interesting astrophysical
phenomena in which the higher magnitude force we derived may play a critical
role: the dynamics of compact objects orbiting the torsioned SCCS and accretion
of matter onto it. The deficit angle associated to the SCCS can be obtained and
compared with data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. We
also derived a value for the torsion contribution to matter density
fluctuations in the early Universe.
