  The minimal chiral Schwinger model is discussed from the
Batalin-Fradkin-Fradkina-Tyutin point of view. The conversion of second-class
constraints to first-class ones results in an extended gauge-invariant theory
which is equivalent for $a=2$ to the vector Schwinger model at the Lagrangian
level. Here, we present arguments which show that such equivalence does not
exist at the operatorial level.
