  In this talk, we present a parity-preserving QED3 model with spontaneous
breaking of a local U(1)-symmetry. The breaking is accomplished by a potential
of the phi^6-type. It is shown that a net attractive interaction appears in the
Moeller scattering (s- and p-wave scatterings between two electrons) as
mediated by the gauge field and a Higgs scalar. We show, by solving numerically
the Schroedinger equation for both the scattering potentials (s- and p-wave),
that in the weak-coupling regime only s-wave bound states appear, whereas in
the strong-coupling regime s- and p-wave bound states show up. Also, we discuss
possible applications of the model to the phenomenology of high-Tc
superconductors and to the re-entrant superconductivity effect.
