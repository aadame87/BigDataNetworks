  Duality arguments suggest the existence of massless magnetic monopoles in
gauge theories with the symmetry broken to a non-Abelian subgroup. I discuss
how these arise and show how they are manifested as clouds of massless fields
surrounding massive monopoles. The dynamics of these clouds is discussed, and
the scattering of massless monopole clouds and massive monopoles is described.
