Title: Finite Volume Spectrum of Sine-Gordon Model and its Restrictions
Authors: G. Feverati
Comments: PhD thesis, 96 pages, 28 figures
\\
  In this thesis, we review recent progresses on Nonlinear Integral Equation
approach to finite size effects in two dimensional integrable quantum field
theories, with emphasis to Sine-Gordon/Massive Thirring model and restrictions
to minimal models perturbed by $\Phi_{1,3}$. Exact calculations of the
dependence of energy levels on the size are presented for vacuum and many
excited states.
