  It has been conjectured that an extremum of the tachyon potential of a
bosonic D-brane represents the vacuum without any D-brane, and that various
tachyonic lump solutions represent D-branes of lower dimension. We show that
the tree level effective action of p-adic string theory, the expression for
which is known exactly, provides an explicit realisation of these conjectures.
