Authors: Alexander Gorsky, Konstantin Selivanov
Comments: 13 pages, contribution to the Proceedings of E.S.Fradkin Memorial
  Conference, Moscow, 2000
\\
  Fate of branes in external fields is reviewed. Spontaneous creation of the
Brane World in $AdS_{5}$ with external field is described. The resulting Brane
World consists of a flat 4d spatially finite expanding Universe and curved
expanding "regulator" branes. All branes have a positive tension.
