  This note focuses on the coupling of a type IIA D2-brane to a background B
field. It is shown that the D0-brane charge arising from the integral over the
D2-brane of the pullback of the B field is cancelled by bulk contributions, for
a compact D2-brane wrapping a homotopically trivial cycle in space-time. In
M-theory this cancellation is a straightforward consequence of momentum
conservation. This result resolves a puzzle recently posed by Bachas, Douglas
and Schweigert related to the quantization of R-R charges on stable spherical
D2-branes on the group manifold SU(2).
