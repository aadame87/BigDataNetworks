  The vacuum sector of the Brans-Dicke theory is studied from the viewpoint of
a non-conformally invariant gravitational model. We show that, this theory can
be conformally symmetrized using an appropriate conformal transformation. The
resulting theory allows a particle interpretation, and suggests that the
quantum aspects of matter may be geometrized.
