  The interplay between topological defects (branes) and black holes has been a
subject of recent study, motivated in part by interest in brane-world
scenarios. In this paper we analyze in detail the description of a black hole
bound to a domain wall (a two-brane in four dimensions), for which an exact
description in the limit of zero wall thickness has been given recently. We
show how to smooth this singular solution with a thick domain wall. We also
show that charged extremal black holes of a size (roughly) smaller than the
brane thickness expel the wall, thereby extending the phenomenon of flux
expulsion. Finally, we analyze the process of black hole nucleation {\it on} a
domain wall, and argue that it is preferred over a previously studied mechanism
of black hole nucleation {\it away} from the wall.
