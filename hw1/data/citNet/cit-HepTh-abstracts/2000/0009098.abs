  Perturbative aspects of ultraviolet and infrared dynamics of noncommutative
quantum field theory is examined in detail. It is observed that high loop
momentum contribution to the nonplanar diagram develops a new infrared
singularity with respect to the external momentum. This singular behavior is
closely related to that of ultraviolet divergence of planar diagram. It is also
shown that such a relation is precise in noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, but
the same feature does not persist in noncommutative generalization of QED.
