  In this paper we derive the general expression of a one-loop effective
potential of the nonintegrable phases of Wilson lines for an SU(N) gauge theory
with a massless adjoint fermion defined on the spactime manifold
$R^{1,d-3}\times T^2$ at finite temperature and fermion density. The Phase
structure of the vacuum is presented for the case with $d=4$ and N=2 at zero
temperature. It is found that gauge symmetry is broken and restored alternately
as the fermion density increases, a feature not found in the Higgs mechanism.
It is the manifestation of the quantum effects of the nonintegrable phases.
