  For perfect fluids with equation of state $\rho = \rho (n,s)$, Brown gave an
action principle depending only on their Lagrange coordinates $\alpha^i(x)$
without Clebsch potentials. After a reformulation on arbitrary spacelike
hypersurfaces in Minkowski spacetime, the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant
form of these perfect fluids is given. Their Hamiltonian invariant mass can be
given in closed form for the dust and the photon gas. The action for the
coupling to tetrad gravity is given. Dixon's multipoles for the perfect fluids
are studied on the rest-frame Wigner hyperplane. It is also shown that the same
formalism can be applied to non-dissipative relativistic elastic materials
described in terms of Lagrangian coordinates.
