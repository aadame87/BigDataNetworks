  We study some of the algebraic properties of the non-relativistic monopole.
We find that we can construct theories that possess an exotic conserved
fermionic charge that squares to the Casimir of the rotation group, yet do not
possess an ordinary supersymmetry. This is in contrast to previous known
examples with such exotic fermionic charges. We proceed to show that the
presence of the exotic fermionic charge in the non-supersymmetric theory can
nonetheless be understood using supersymmetric techniques, providing yet
another example of the usefulness of supersymmetry in understanding
non-supersymmetric theories.
