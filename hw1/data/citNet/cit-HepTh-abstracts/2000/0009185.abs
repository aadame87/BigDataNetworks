  We show that two-dimensional (2D) AdS gravity induces on the spacetime
boundary a conformally invariant dynamics that can be described in terms of a
de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model coupled to an external source with conformal
dimension two. The external source encodes the information about the gauge
symmetries of the 2D gravity system. Alternatively, there exists a description
in terms of a mechanical system with anholonomic constraints. The considered
systems are invariant under the action of the conformal group generated by a
Virasoro algebra, which occurs also as asymptotic symmetry algebra of
two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. We calculate the central charge of the
algebra and find perfect agreement between statistical and thermodynamical
entropy of AdS_2 black holes.
