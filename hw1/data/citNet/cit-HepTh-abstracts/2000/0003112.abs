  We revise the problem of the quantization of relativistic particle models
(spinless and spinning), presenting a modified consistent canonical scheme. One
of the main point of the modification is related to a principally new
realization of the Hilbert space. It allows one not only to include arbitrary
backgrounds in the consideration but to get in course of the quantization a
consistent relativistic quantum mechanics, which reproduces literally the
behavior of the one-particle sector of the corresponding quantum field. In
particular, in a physical sector of the Hilbert space a complete positive
spectrum of energies of relativistic particles and antiparticles is reproduced,
and all state vectors have only positive norms.
