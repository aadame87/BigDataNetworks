  We study the cosmological evolution of a D3-brane Universe in a type 0 string
background. We follow the brane-universe along the radial coordinate of the
background and we calculate the energy density which is induced on the brane
because of its motion in the bulk. We find that for some typical values of the
parameters and for a particular range of values of the scale factor of the
brane-universe, the effective energy density is dominated by a term
proportional to $\frac{1}{(loga)^{4}}$ indicating a slow varying inflationary
phase. For larger values of the scale factor the effective energy density takes
a constant value and the brane-universe enters its usual inflationary period.
