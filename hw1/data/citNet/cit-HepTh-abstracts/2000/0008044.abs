  We address the general question of how to reconstruct the field content of a
quantum field theory from a given scattering theory in the context of the form
factor program. For the $SU(3)_2$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model we construct
systematically all $n$-particle form factors for a huge class of operators in
terms of general determinant formulae. We investigate how different operators
are interrelated by the momentum space cluster property. Finally we compute
several two-point correlation functions and carry out the ultraviolet limit in
order to identify each operator with its corresponding partner in the
underlying conformal field theory.
