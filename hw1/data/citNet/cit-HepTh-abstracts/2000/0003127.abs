  The possibility of non-trivial representations of the gauge group on
wavefunctionals of a gauge invariant quantum field theory leads to a generation
of mass for intermediate vector and tensor bosons. The mass parameters "m" show
up as central charges in the algebra of constraints, which then become of
second-class nature. The gauge group coordinates acquire dynamics outside the
null-mass shell and provide the longitudinal field degrees of freedom that
massless bosons need to form massive bosons.
