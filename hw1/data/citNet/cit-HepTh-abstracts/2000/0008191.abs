  In this short note we briefly review some recent developments in
understanding discrete torsion. Specifically, we give a short overview of the
highlights of a group of recent papers which give the basic understanding of
discrete torsion. Briefly, those papers observe that discrete torsion can be
completely understood simply as the choice of action of the orbifold group on
the B field. We summarize the main points of that work.
