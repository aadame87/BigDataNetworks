  We present some results about the interplay between the chiral and
deconfinement phase transitions in parity-conserving QED3 (with N flavours of
massless 4 component fermions) at finite temperature. Following Grignani et al
(Phys. Rev. D53, 7157 (1996), Nucl. Phys. B473, 143 (1996)), confinement is
discussed in terms of an effective Sine-Gordon theory for the timelike
component of the gauge field A_0. But whereas in the references above the
fermion mass m is a Lagrangian parameter, we consider the m=0 case and ask
whether an effective S-G theory can again be derived with m replaced by the
dynamically generated mass Sigma which appears below T_{ch}, the critical
temperature for the chiral phase transition. The fermion and gauge sectors are
strongly interdependent, but as a first approximation we decouple them by
taking Sigma to be a constant, depending only on the constant part of the gauge
field. We argue that the existence of a low-temperature confining phase may be
associated with the generation of Sigma; and that, analogously, the vanishing
of Sigma for T > T_{ch} drives the system to its deconfining phase. The effect
of the gauge field dynamics on mass generation is also indicated. (38kb)
