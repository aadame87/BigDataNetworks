  In most current models of inflation based on a weakly self-coupled scalar
matter field minimally coupled to gravity, the period of inflation lasts so
long that, at the beginning of the inflationary period, the physical
wavelengths of comoving scales which correspond to the present large-scale
structure of the Universe were smaller than the Planck length. Thus, the usual
computations of the spectrum of fluctuations in these models involve
extrapolating low energy physics (both in the matter and gravitational sector)
into regions where this physics is not applicable. In this paper we demonstrate
that the usual predictions of inflation for the spectrum of cosmological
fluctuations do indeed depend on the hidden assumptions about super-Planck
scale physics. We introduce a class of modified dispersion relations to mimic
possible effects of super-Planck scale physics, and show that in some cases
important deviations from the usual predictions of inflation are obtained. Some
implications of this result for the unification of fundamental physics and
early Universe cosmology are discussed.
