  In 2+1 dimensions there exists a duality between a charged Dirac particle
coupled minimally to a background vector potential and a neutral one coupled
nonminimally to a background electromagnetic field strength. A constant uniform
background electric current induces in the vacuum of the neutral particle a
fermion current which is proportional to the background one. A background
electromagnetic plane wave induces no current in the vacuum. For constant but
nonuniform background electric charge, known results for charged particles can
be translated to give the induced fermion number. Some new examples with
infinite background electric charge are presented. The induced spin and total
angular momentum are also discussed.
