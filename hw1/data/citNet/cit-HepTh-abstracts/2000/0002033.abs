  In order to reconcile the non conventional character of brane cosmology with
standard Friedmann cosmology, we introduce in this paper a slowly-varying
quintessence scalar field in the brane and analyse the cosmological solutions
corresponding to some equations of state for the scalar field. Different
compensation mechanisms between the cosmological constant in the bulk and the
constant tension resulting from the combined effect of ordinary matter and the
quintessence scalar field are derived or assumed. It has been checked that the
Randall-Sundrum approach is not necessarily the best procedure to reconcile
brane and standard cosmologies, and that there exists at least another
compensating mechanism that reproduces a rather conventional behaviour for an
accelerating universe.
