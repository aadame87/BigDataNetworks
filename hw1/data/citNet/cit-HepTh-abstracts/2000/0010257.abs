  A class of non abelian affine Toda models is constructed in terms of the
axial and vector gauged WZW model. It is shown that the multivacua structure of
the potential together with non abelian nature of the zero grade subalgebra
allows soliton solutions with non trivial electric and topological charges.
Their zero curvature representation and the classical $r$-matrix are also
constructed in order to prove their classical integrability.
