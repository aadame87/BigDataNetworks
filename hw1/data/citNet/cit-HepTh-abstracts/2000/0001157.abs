  We review some aspects of moduli in string theory. We argue that one should
focus on {\it approximate moduli spaces}, and that there is evidence that such
spaces exist non-perturbatively. We ask what it would mean for string theory to
predict low energy supersymmetry. Aspects of two proposed mechanisms for fixing
the moduli are discussed, and solutions to certain cosmological problems
associated with moduli are proposed.
