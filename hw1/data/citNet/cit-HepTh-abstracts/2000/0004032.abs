  The topological nature of Chern-Simons term describing the interaction of a
charge with magnetic monopole is manifested in two ways: it changes the plane
dynamical geometry of a free particle for the cone dynamical geometry without
distorting the free (geodesic) character of the motion, and in the limit of
zero charge's mass it describes a spin system. This observation allows us to
interpret the charge-monopole system alternatively as a free particle of fixed
spin with translational and spin degrees of freedom interacting via the
helicity constraint, or as a symmetric spinning top with dynamical moment of
inertia and "isospin" U(1) gauge symmetry, or as a system with higher
derivatives. The last interpretation is used to get the twistor formulation of
the system. We show that the reparametrization and scale invariant monopole
Chern-Simons term supplied with the kinetic term of the same invariance gives
rise to the alternative description for the spin, which is related to the
charge-monopole system in a spherical geometry. The relationship between the
charge-monopole system and (2+1)-dimensional anyon is discussed in the light of
the obtained results.
