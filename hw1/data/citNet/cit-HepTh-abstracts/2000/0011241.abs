  We briefly discuss some possible cosmological implications of noncommutative
geometry. While the noncommutativity we consider does not affect gravity, it
can play an important role in the dynamics of other fields that are present in
the early universe. We point out the possibility that noncommutativity may
cause inflation induced fluctuations to become non-gaussian and anisotropic,
and may modify the short distance dispersion relations.
