  We show that a new expansion which sums seagull and bubble graphs to all
orders, can be applied to the O(N) linear sigma model at finite temperature. We
prove that this expansion can be renormalised with the usual counterterms in a
mass independent scheme and that Goldstone's theorem is satisfied at each
order. At the one loop order of this expansion, the Hartree result for the
effective potential (daisy and superdaisy graphs) is recovered. We show that at
one loop 2PPI order, the self energy of the sigma meson can be calculated
exactly and that diagrams are summed beyond the Hartree approximation.
