  Without invalidating quantum mechanics as a principle underlying the dynamics
of a fundamental theory, it is possible to ask for even more basic dynamical
laws that may yield quantum mechanics as the machinery needed for its
statistical analysis. In conventional systems such as the Standard Model for
quarks and leptons, this would lead to hidden variable theories, which are
known to be plagued by problems such as non-locality. But Planck scale physics
is so different from field theories in some flat background space-time that
here the converse may be the case: we speculate that causality and locality can
only be restored by postulating a deterministic underlying theory. A price to
be paid may be that the underlying theory exhibits dissipation of information.
