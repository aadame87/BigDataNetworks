  The calculation of bound state properties using renormalization group
techniques to compute the corresponding Regge trajectories is presented. In
particular, we investigate the bound states in different charge sectors of a
scalar theory with interaction (phi^dagger phi chi). The resulting bound state
spectrum is surprisingly rich. Where possible we compare and contrast with
known results of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation and,
in the non-relativistic limit, with the corresponding Schr"odinger equation.
