  Deformation quantization of bosonic strings is considered. We show that the
light-cone gauge is the most convenient classical description to perform the
quantization of bosonic strings in the deformation quantization formalism.
Similar to the field theory case, the oscillator variables greatly facilitates
the analysis. The mass spectrum, propagators and the Virasoro algebra are
finally described within this deformation quantization scheme.
