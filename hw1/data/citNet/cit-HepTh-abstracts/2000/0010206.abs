  We introduce a class of supersymmetric cycles in spacetimes of the form AdS
times a sphere or $T^{1,1}$ which can be considered as generalizations of the
giant gravitons. Branes wrapped on these cycles preserve $1\over 2$, $1\over 4$
or $1\over 8$ of the supersymmetry. On the CFT side these configurations
correspond to superpositions of the large number of BPS states.
