  Starting from a recently proposed abelian topological model in (2+1)
dimensions, we use the method of the consistent deformations to prove that a
topologically massive model involving the Kalb-Ramond two form field does not
admit a nonabelian generalization. The introduction of a connection-type one
form field keeps the previous result. However we show that the goal is achieved
if we introduce a vectorial auxiliary field, exhibiting a nonabelian
topological mass generation mechanism in D=3, that provides mass for the
Kalb-Ramond field. Further, we find the complete set of BRST and anti-BRST
equations using the horizontality condition, suggesting a connection between
this formalism and the method of the consistent deformations.
