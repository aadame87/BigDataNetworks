  Over the past decade it has become clear that fundamental strings are not the
only fundamental degrees of freedom in string theory. D-branes are also part of
the spectrum of fundamental states. In this paper we explore some possible
effects of D-branes on early Universe string cosmology, starting with two key
assumptions: firstly that the initial state of the Universe corresponded to a
dense, hot gas in which all degrees of freedom were in thermal equilibrium, and
secondly that the topology of the background space admits one-cycles. We argue
by t-duality that in this context the cosmological singularities are not
present. We derive the equation of state of the brane gases and apply the
results to suggest that, in an expanding background, the winding modes of
fundamental strings will play the most important role at late times. In
particular, we argue that the string winding modes will only allow four
space-time dimensions to become large. The presence of brane winding modes with
$p > 1$ may lead to a hierarchy in the sizes of the extra dimensions.
