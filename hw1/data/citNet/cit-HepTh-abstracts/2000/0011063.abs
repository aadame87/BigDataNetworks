Title: Vacuum-Structure and a Relativistic Pilot Wave

  We study a model for analyzing the effect of a principal violation of the
Lorentz-invariance on the structure of vacuum. The model is based on the
divergence theory developed by Salehi (1997). It is shown that the divergence
theory can be used to model an ensemble of particles. The ensemble is
characterized by the condition that its members are basically at rest in the
rest frame of a preferred inertial observer in vacuum. In this way we find a
direct dynamical interplay between a particle and its associated ensemble. We
show that this effect can be understood in terms of the interaction of a
particle with a relativistic pilot wave through an associated quantum
potential.
