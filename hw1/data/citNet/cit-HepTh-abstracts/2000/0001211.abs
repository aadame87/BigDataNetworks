  In the dilatonic domain wall model, we study the Schwarzschild black hole as
a solution to the Kaluza-Klein (KK) zero mode effective action which is
equivalent to the Brans-Dicke (BD) model with a potential. This can describe
the large Randall-Sundrum (RS) black hole whose horizon is to be the
intersection of the black cigar with the brane.
  The black cigar located far from the AdS$_5$-horizon is known to be stable,
but any explicit calculation for stability of the RS black hole at $z=0$ is not
yet performed. Here its stability is investigated against the $z$-independent
perturbations composed of odd, even parities of graviton ($h_{\mu\nu}$) and BD
scalar($h_{44} = 2\phi $). It seems that the RS black hole is classically
unstable because it has a potential instability at wavelength with $\lambda >
1/(2k)$. However, this is not allowed inside an AdS$_5$-box of the size with
$1/(2k)$. Thus the RS black hole becomes stable. The RS black hole can be
considered as a stable remnant at $z=0 $ of the black cigar.
