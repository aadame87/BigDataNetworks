  We study gauge properties of the general teleparallel theory of gravity,
defined in the framework of Poincare gauge theory. It is found that the general
theory is characterized by two kinds of gauge symmetries: a specific gauge
symmetry that acts on Lagrange multipliers, and the standard Poincare gauge
symmetry. The canonical generators of these symmetries are explicitly
constructed and investigated.
