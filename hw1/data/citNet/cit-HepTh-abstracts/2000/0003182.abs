  It is shown that the method of the nonlinear realization of local
supersymmetry previously developed in framework of supergravity being applied
to the n=(2,2) superconformal symmetry allows one to get the new form of the
exactly solvable n=(2,2) super-Liouville equation. The general advantage of
this version as compared with the conventional one is that its bosonic part
includes the complex Liouville equation. We obtain the suitable supercovariant
constraints imposed on the corresponding superfields which provide the set of
the resulting system of component equations be the same as that in model of
N=2, D=4 Green-Schwarz superstring. The general solution of this system is
derived from the corresponding solution of the bosonic string equation.
