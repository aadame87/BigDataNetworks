  The "measurability" of the non-minimal coupling is discussed in the context
of the effective field theory of gravity. Although there is no obvious motive
for excluding a non-minimal scalar coupling from the theory, we conclude that
for reasonable values of the coupling constant it makes only a very small
correction.
