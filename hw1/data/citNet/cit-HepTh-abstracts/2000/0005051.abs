  We study Euclidean D=4, N=4 gauged $SU(2) \times SU(1,1)$ supergravity theory
which has been obtained from dimensional reduction of N=1, D=10 supergravity on
$S^3 \times AdS_3$. We obtain supersymmetric configurations like domain wall,
electro-vac type of solutions with geometries $E^2 \times S^2$, $E^2 \times
AdS_2$ and axio-vac type $E^1 \times S^3$ solution in this Euclidean
Freedman-Schwarz (EFS) model. We also show that the Euclidean gravitational
instantons with nontrivial (anti)self-dual U(1) gauge fields are stable vacua
preserving one fourth of the original supersymmetry.
