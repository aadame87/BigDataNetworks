  We examine noncommutative Yang-Mills and open string theories using
magnetically and electrically deformed supergravity duals. The duals are near
horizon regions of Dp-brane bound state solutions which are obtained by using
O(p+1,p+1) transformations of Dp-branes. The action of the T-duality group
implies that the noncommutativity parameter is constant along holographic
RG-flows. The moduli of the noncommutative theory, i.e., the open string metric
and coupling constant, as well as the zero-force condition are shown to be
invariant under the O(p+1,p+1) transformation, i.e., deformation independent.
We find sufficient conditions, including zero force and constant dilaton in the
ISO(3,1)-invariant D3 brane solution, for exact S-duality between
noncommutative Yang-Mills and open string theories. These results are used to
construct noncommutative field and string theories with N=1 supersymmetry from
the T^(1,1) and Pilch-Warner solutions. The latter has a non-trivial zero-force
condition due to the warping.
