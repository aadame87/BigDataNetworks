  The energy radiated during the scattering of SU(3) monopoles is estimated as
a function of their asymptotic velocity v. In a typical scattering process the
total energy radiated is of order v^3 as opposed to v^5 for SU(2) monopoles.
For charge (1,1) monopoles the dipole radiation produced is estimated for all
geodesics on the moduli space. For charge (2,1) monopoles the dipole radiation
is estimated for the axially symmetric geodesic. The power radiated appears to
diverge in the massless limit. The implications of this for the case of
non-Abelian unbroken symmetry are discussed.
