  We study the two-point function for the gauge boson in the axial-type gauges.
We use the exact treatment of the axial gauges recently proposed that is
intrinsically compatible with the Lorentz type gauges in the path-integral
formulation and has been arrived at from this connection and which is a
``one-vector'' treatment. We find that in this treatment, we can evaluate the
two-point functions without imposing any additional interpretation on the axial
gauge 1/(n.q)^p-type poles. The calculations are as easy as the other
treatments based on other known prescriptions. Unlike the
``uniform-prescription'' /L-M prescription, we note, here, the absence of any
non-local divergences in the 2-point proper vertex. We correlate our
calculation with that for the Cauchy Principal Value prescription and find from
this comparison that the 2-point proper vertex differs from the CPV calculation
only by finite terms. For simplicity of treatment, the divergences have been
calculated here with n^2>0 and these have a smooth light cone limit.
