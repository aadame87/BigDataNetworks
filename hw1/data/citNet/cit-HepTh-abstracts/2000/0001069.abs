  Connection of the invariant Dirac equation over the de Sitter space with
irreducible representations of the de Sitter group is ascertained. The set of
solutions of this equation is obtained in the form of the product of two
different systems of generalized coherent states for the de Sitter group. Using
these solutions the quantized Dirac field over de Sitter space is constructed
and its propagator is found. It is a result of action of some de Sitter
invariant spinor operator onto the spin zero propagator with an imaginary shift
of a mass.
