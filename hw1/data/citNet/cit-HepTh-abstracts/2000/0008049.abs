  We quantize the Maxwell Chern Simons theory in a geometric representation
that generalizes the Abelian Loop Representation of Maxwell theory. We find
that in the physical sector, the model can be seen as the theory of a massles
scalar field with a topological interaction that enforces the wave functional
to be multivalued. This feature allows to relate the Maxwell Chern Simons
theory with the quantum mechanics of particles interacting through a Chern
Simons field
