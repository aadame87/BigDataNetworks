  We present a Lorentz invariant lagrangian formulation for a supersymmetric
Yang-Mills vector multiplet in eleven dimensions (11D). The Lorentz symmetry is
broken at the field equation level, and therefore the breaking is spontaneous,
as in other formulations of supersymmetric theories in 12D or higher
dimensions. We introduce a space-like unit vector formed by the gradient of a
scalar field, avoiding the problem of Lorentz non-invariance at the lagrangian
level, which is also an analog of non-commutative geometry with constant field
strengths breaking Lorentz covariance. The constancy of the space-like unit
vector field is implied by the field equation of a multiplier field. The field
equations for the physical fields are formally the same as those of 10D
supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplet, but now with some constraints on these
fields for supersymmetric consistency. This formulation also utilizes the
multiplier fields accompanied by the bilinear forms of constraints, such that
these multiplier fields will not interfere with the physical field equations.
Based on this component result, we also present a $\k$-symmetric supermembrane
action with the supersymmetric Yang-Mills backgrounds.
