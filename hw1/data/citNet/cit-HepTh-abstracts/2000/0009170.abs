  We develop a general framework for effective equations of expectation values
in quantum cosmology and pose for them the quantum Cauchy problem with
no-boundary and tunneling wavefunctions. We apply this framework in the model
with a big negative non-minimal coupling, which incorporates a recently
proposed low energy (GUT scale) mechanism of the quantum origin of the
inflationary Universe and study the effects of the quantum inflaton mode.
