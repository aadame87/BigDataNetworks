  We construct supergravity solutions dual to the twisted field theories
arising when M-theory fivebranes wrap general supersymmetric cycles. The
solutions are constructed in maximal D=7 gauged supergravity and then uplifted
to D=11. Our analysis covers Kahler, special Lagrangian and exceptional
calibrated cycles. The metric on the cycles are Einstein, but do not
necessarily have constant curvature. We find many new examples of AdS/CFT
duality, corresponding to the IR superconformal fixed points of the twisted
field theories.
