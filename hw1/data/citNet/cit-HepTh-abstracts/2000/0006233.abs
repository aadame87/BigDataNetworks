  We study various aspects of parafermionic theories such as the precise field
content, a description of a basis of states (that is, the counting of
independent states in a freely generated highest-weight module) and the
explicit expression of the parafermionic singular vectors in completely
irreducible modules. This analysis culminates in the presentation of new
character formulae for the $Z_N$ parafermionic primary fields. These characters
provide novel field theoretical expressions for $\su(2)$ string functions.
