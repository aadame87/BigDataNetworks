  We exactly calculate the thermal distribution and temperature of Hawking
radiation for a two-dimensional charged dilatonic black hole after it has
settled down to an "equilibrium" state. The calculation is carried out using
the Bogoliubov coefficients. The background of the process is furnished by a
preexisting black hole and not by collapsing matter as considered by Giddings
and Nelson for the case of a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore, the
vanishing of the temperature and/or the Hawking radiation in the extremal case
is obtained as a regular limit of the general case.
