Title: Charged Matter: Physics and Renormalisation
Authors: Emili Bagan, Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX, to appear in the proceedings of the workshop
  `Physical Variables in Gauge Theories'
\\
  Descriptions of the ground state in unbroken gauge theories with charged
particles are discussed. In particular it is shown that the on-shell Green's
functions and S-matrix elements corresponding to the scattering of these
variables in QED are free of soft and phase infra red divergences and that
these variables may be multiplicatively renormalised.
