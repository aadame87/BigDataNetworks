  We discuss how the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant enters brane
world setups. After presenting the Randall Sundrum model as a prototype case,
we focus on single brane models with curvature singularities which are
separated from the brane in the additional dimension. Finally, the issue of the
existence of nearby curved solutions is addressed.
