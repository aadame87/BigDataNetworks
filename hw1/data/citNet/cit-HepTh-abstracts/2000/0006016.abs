  In this paper, we investigate the beta-function of the gauge coupling
constant ($e$) of the gauged four-fermi theory in the Exact Renormalization
Group (ERG) framework. It seems that the presence of the four-fermi interaction
strongly affects to the naive RG running of the gauge coupling constant. We
show that this strong correction has no physical meaning since the vertex $\app
A\SR\psi$ involves the contribution from a mixing as well as a pure gauge
interaction due to the (anomalous) mixing among the photon and the vector
composite field. By introducing the auxiliary field for the vector composite
field, the situation turns to be rather clear. We adopt the counterterm to
cancel the gauge non-invariant correction, and decompose the pure gauge
interaction from the contribution of the mixing. We find the beta-function of
the gauge coupling constant in the large $N$ limit.
