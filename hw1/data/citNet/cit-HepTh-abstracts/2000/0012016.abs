  The static Yang-Mills-Higgs dyonic instanton is shown to have a
non-vanishing, but anti-self-dual, angular momentum 2-form with skew
eigenvalues equal to the electric charge; for large charge the angular momentum
causes the instanton to expand into a hyper-spherical shell. A class of exact
multi dyonic instantons is then found and then generalized to a new class of
1/4 supersymmetric, non-singular, stationary, exact solutions of the
ten-dimensional supergravity/Yang-Mills theory. These self-gravitating dyonic
instantons yield new heterotic string solitons, to leading order in the inverse
string tension.
