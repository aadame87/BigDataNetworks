  A solution of the Randall-Sundrum model for a simplified case (one wall) is
obtained. It is given by the $1/k^2$-expansion (thin wall expansion) where
$1/k$ is the {\it thickness} of the domain wall. The vacuum setting is done by
the 5D Higgs potential and the solution is for a {\it family} of the Higgs
parameters. The mass hierarchy problem is examined. Some physical quantities in
4D world such as the Planck mass, the cosmological constant, and fermion masses
are focussed. Similarity to the domain wall regularization used in the chiral
fermion problem is explained. We examine the possibility that the 4D massless
chiral fermion bound to the domain wall in the 5D world can be regarded as the
real 4D fermions such as neutrinos, quarks and other leptons.
