  We study the cosmological evolution of the four-dimensional universe on the
probe D3-brane in geodesic motion in the curved background of the source
Dp-brane with non-zero NS B field. The Friedman equations describing the
expansion of the brane universe are obtained and analyzed for various limits.
We elaborate on corrections to the cosmological evolution due to nonzero NS B
field.
