  We generalize, to any space-time dimension, the unitarity bounds of highest
weight UIR's of the conformal groups with Lie algebras $so(2,d)$. We classify
gauge theories invariant under $so(2,d)$, both integral and half-integral
spins. A similar analysis is carried out for the algebras $so^*(2n)$. We study
new unitary modules of the conformal algebra in $d>4$, that have no analogue
for $d\leq 4$ as they cannot be obtained by "squaring" singletons. This may
suggest the interpretation of higher dimensional non-trivial conformal field
theories as theories of "tensionless" $p$-branes of which tensionless strings
in $d=6$ are just particular examples.
