  Quantum mechanics on sphere $S^{n}$ is studied from the viewpoint that the
Berry's connection has to appear as a topological term in the effective action.
Furthermore we show that this term is the Chern-Simons term of gauge variables
that correspond to the extra degrees of freedom of the enlarged space.
