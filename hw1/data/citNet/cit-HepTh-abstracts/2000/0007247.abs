  We consider noncommutative theory of a compact scalar field. The recently
discovered projector solitons are interpreted as classical vacua in the model
considered. Localized solutions to the projector equation are pointed out and
their brane interpretation is discussed. An example of the noncommutative
soliton interpolating between such vacua is given. No strong noncommutativity
limit is assumed.
