  Type IIB superstring models with the standard model gauge group on D3-branes
and with massless matter associated with open strings joining D3-branes to
D3-branes or D3-branes to ${\rm D}7_3$-branes are studied. Models with gauge
coupling constant unification at an intermediate scale between about $10^{10}$
and $10^{12}$GeV and consistency with the observed value of $\sin^2 \theta_W
(M_Z)$ are obtained. Extra vector-like states and extra pairs of Higgs doublets
play a crucial role.
