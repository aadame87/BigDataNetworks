  In AdS_{2p+1} we construct propagators for p-forms whose lagrangians contain
terms of the form A / d A. In particular we explore the case of forms
satisfying ``self duality in odd dimensions'', and the case of forms with a
topological mass term. We point out that the ``complete'' set of maximally
symmetric bitensors previously used in all the other propagator papers is
incomplete - there exists another bitensor which can and does appear in the
formulas for the propagators in this particular case. Nevertheless, its
presence does not affect the other propagators computed so far.
  On the AdS side of the correspondence we compute the 2 and 3 point functions
involving the self-dual tensor of the maximal 7d gauged supergravity (sugra),
S_{\mu\nu\rho}. Since the 7 dimensional antisymmetric self-dual tensor obeys
first order field equations (S + * d S=0), to get a nonvanishing 2 point
function we add a certain boundary term (to satisfy the variational principle
on a manifold with boundary) to the 7d action. The 3 point functions we compute
are of the type SSB and SBB, describing vertex interactions with the gauge
fields B_{\mu}.
