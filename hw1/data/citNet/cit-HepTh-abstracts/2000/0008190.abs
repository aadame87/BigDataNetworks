  We consider the theory of higher derivative gravity with non-factorizable
Randall-Sundrum type space-time and obtain the metric solutions which
characterize the $p$-brane world-volume as a curved or planar defect embedded
in the higher dimensions. We consider the string inspired effective actions of
the dilatonic Gauss-Bonnet type in the brane background and show its
consistency with the RS brane-world scenario and the conformal weight of the
dilaton couplings in the string theory with apppropriate choice of Regge slope
($\alpha'$) or Gauss-Bonnet coupling ($\alpha$) or both. We also discuss a time
dependent dilaton solution for a string-inspired fourth-derivative gravity.
