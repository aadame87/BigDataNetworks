  The family of brane-world solutions of d+1-dimensional dilatonic gravity is
presented. It includes flat brane with small cosmological constant and (anti)
de Sitter brane, dilatonic brane-world black holes (Schwarzschild-(anti-) de
Sitter, Kerr, etc). Gravitational and dilatonic perturbations around such
branes are found. It is shown that near dilatonic brane-world black hole the
gravity may be localized in a standard form. The brane corrections to Newton
law are estimated. The proposal to take into account the dilaton coupled brane
matter quantum effects is made. The corresponding effective action changes the
structure of 4d de Sitter wall. RG flow of four-dimensional Newton constant in
IR and UV is briefly discussed.
