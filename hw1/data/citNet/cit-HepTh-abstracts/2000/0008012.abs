  We study localization of bosonic bulk fields on a string-like defect with
codimension 2 in a general space-time dimension in detail. We show that in
cases of spin 0 scalar and spin 1 vector fields there are an infinite number of
massless Kaluza-Klein (KK) states which are degenerate with respect to the
radial quantum number, but only the massless zero mode state among them is
coupled to fermion on the string-like defect. It is also commented on
interesting extensions of the model at hand to various directions such as
'little' superstring theory, conformal field theory and a supersymmetric
construction.
