  We study the large N limit of SO(N) and Sp(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory on
S^3 and identify its closed string dual as topological strings on an
orientifold of the small resolution of the conifold. Applications to large N
dualities for N=1 supersymmetric gauge systems in 4 dimensions are also
discussed.
