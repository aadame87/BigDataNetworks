  We extend the construction of the boundary states in Gepner models to the
non-diagonal modular invariant theories, and derive the same supersymmetric
conditions as the diagonal theories. We also investigate the relation between
the microscopic charges of the boundary states and Ramond charges of the B-type
D-branes on the Calabi-Yau threefolds with one K\"ahler modulus in the large
volume limit.
