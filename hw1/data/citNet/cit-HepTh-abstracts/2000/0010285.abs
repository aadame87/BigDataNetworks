  We extend an implicit regularization scheme to be applicable in the
$n$-dimensional space-time. Within this scheme divergences involving parity
violating objects can be consistently treated without recoursing to dimensional
continuation. Special attention is paid to differences between integrals of the
same degree of divergence, typical of one loop calculations, which are in
principle undetermined. We show how to use symmetries in order to fix these
quantities consistently. We illustrate with examples in which regularization
plays a delicate role in order to both corroborate and elucidate the results in
the literature for the case of CPT violation in extended $QED_4$, topological
mass generation in 3-dimensional gauge theories and the Schwinger Model and its
chiral version.
