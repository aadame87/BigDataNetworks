  According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the maximally supersymmetric SU(N)
Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions is dual to the type IIB string theory
compactified on AdS_5 x S^5. Most of the tests performed so far are confined to
the leading order at large N or equivalently string tree-level. To probe the
correspondence beyond this leading order and obtain 1/N^2 corrections is
difficult since string one-loop computations on an AdS_5 x S^5 background
generally are beyond feasibility. However, we will show that the chiral SU(4)_R
anomaly of the super YM theory provides an ideal testing ground to go beyond
leading order in N. We review and develop further our previous results that the
1/N^2 corrections to the chiral anomaly on the super YM side can be exactly
accounted for by the supergravity/string effective action induced at one loop.
