  We propose a class of models in which extended objects are introduced in
Chern-Simons supergravity in such a way that those objects appear on the same
footing as the target space. This is motivated by the idea that branes are
already first quantized object, so that it is desirable to have a formalism
that treats branes and their target space in a similar fashion. Accordingly,
our models describe interacting branes, as gauge systems for supergroups. We
also consider the case in which those objects have boundaries, and discuss
possible links to superstring theory and/or M-theory, by studying the fermionic
kappa-symmetry of the action.
