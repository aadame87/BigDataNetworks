Title: Generalized Fractional Supersymmetry associated to different species of
  anyons
Authors: Jamila Douari and Yassine Hassouni
Comments: 12 pages, 2 figures included
\\
  We consider multiple species of anyons characterized by different statistical
parameters. First, we redefine the anyonic algebra and then generalize this
definition by constructing the anyonic superalgebra. Finally, we use these
tools to generalize the fractional supersymmetry already discussed in the paper
[J. Douari and Y. Hassouni, Fractional supersymmetry through generalized
anyonic algebra, hep-th/0007165, Preprint ICTP].
