  We examine several aspects of S-duality of four-dimensional noncommutative
gauge theory. By making duality transformation explicit, we find that S-dual of
noncommutative gauge theory is defined in terms of dual noncommutative
deformation. In `magnetic' noncommutative U(1) gauge theory, we show that, in
addition to gauge bosons, open D-strings constitute important low-energy
excitations: noncritical open D-strings. Upon S-duality, they are mapped to
noncritical open F-strings. We propose that, in dual `electric' noncommutative
U(1) gauge theory, the latters are identified with gauge-invariant, open Wilson
lines. We argue that the open Wilson lines are chiral due to underlying parity
noninvariance and obey spacetime uncertainty relation. We finally argue that,
at high energy-momentum limit, the `electric' noncommutative gauge theory
describes correctly dynamics of delocalized multiple F-strings.
