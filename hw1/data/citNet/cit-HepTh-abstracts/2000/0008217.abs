Title: On the universality of string theory
Authors: Karl-Georg Schlesinger
Comments: 15 pages
\\
  String theory is accused by some of its critics to be a purely abstract
mathematical discipline, having lost the contact to the simple yet deeply
rooted questions which physics provided until the beginning of this century. We
argue that, in contrary, there are indications that string theory might be
linked to a fundamental principle of a quantum computational character. In
addition, the nature of this principle might be capable to provide some new
insight into the question of universality of string theory.
