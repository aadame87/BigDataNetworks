  String representation of the Wilson loop in 3D Abelian-projected
SU(3)-gluodynamics is constructed in the approximation that Abelian-projected
monopoles form a gas. Such an assumption is much weaker than the standard one,
demanding the monopole condensation. It is demonstrated that the summation over
world sheets, bounded by the contour of the Wilson loop, is realized by the
summation over branches of a certain effective multivalued potential of the
monopole densities. Finally, by virtue of the so-constructed representation of
the Wilson loop in terms of the monopole densities, this quantity is evaluated
in the approximation of a dilute monopole gas, which makes confinement in the
model under study manifest.
