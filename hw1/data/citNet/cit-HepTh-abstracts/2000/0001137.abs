  In a deep-infrared (ergodic) regime, QCD coupled to massive pseudoreal and
real quarks are described by chiral orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of
random matrices. Using this correspondence, general expressions for the QCD
partition functions are derived in terms of microscopically rescaled mass
variables. In limited cases, correlation functions of Dirac eigenvalues and
distributions of the smallest Dirac eigenvalue are given as ratios of these
partition functions. When all masses are degenerate, our results reproduce the
known expressions for the partition functions of zero-dimensional sigma models.
