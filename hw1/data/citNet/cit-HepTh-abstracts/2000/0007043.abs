  We derive nonperturbative classical solutions of noncommutative U(1) gauge
theory, with or without a Higgs field, representing static magnetic flux tubes
with arbitrary cross-section. The fields are nonperturbatively different from
the vacuum in at least some region of space. The flux of these tubes is
quantized in natural units. We also point out that magnetic monopole charge can
be fractionized by embedding the monopoles in a constant magnetic field.
