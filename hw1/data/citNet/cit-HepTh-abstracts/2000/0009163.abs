  Following the formalism of enveloping algebras and star product calculus we
formulate and analyze a model of gauge gravity on noncommutative spaces and
examine the conditions of its equivalence to general relativity. The
corresponding Seiberg-Witten maps are established which allow the definition of
respective dynamics for a finite number of gravitational gauge field components
on noncommutative spaces.
