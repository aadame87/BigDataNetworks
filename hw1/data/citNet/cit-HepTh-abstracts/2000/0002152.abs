Title: Scalar Quartic Effective Action on $AdS_5$
Authors: G.Arutyunov and S.Frolov
Comments: 6 pages, Latex, JHEP style; based on the talk by G. Arutyunov at the
  TMR Meeting "Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and
  Unification" held in Paris, September 1999
\\
  We review the recent results concerning the computation of cubic and quartic
couplings of scalar fields in type IIB supergravity on AdS_5\times S^5
background that are dual to (extended) chiral primary operators in N=4 SYM_4.
We discuss the vanishing of certain cubic and quartic couplings and
non-renormalization property of corresponding correlators in the conformal
field theory
