  We review a recent progress in constructing low-energy effective action in
N=4 super Yang-Mills theories. Using harmonic superspace approach we consider
N=4 SYM in terms of unconstrained N=2 superfield and apply N=2 background field
method to finding effective action for N=4 SU(n) SYM broken down to
U(n)$^{n-1}$. General structure of leading low-energy corrections to effective
action is discussed.
