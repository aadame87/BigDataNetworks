  We apply a soft version of the BPHZ subtraction scheme to the computation of
two-loop corrections from an Abelian Chern-Simons field coupled to (massive)
scalar matter with a $\lambda(\Phi^\dag\Phi)^2$ and $\nu(\Phi^\dag\Phi)^3$
self-interactions. The two-loop renormalization group functions are calculated.
We compare our results with those in the literature.
