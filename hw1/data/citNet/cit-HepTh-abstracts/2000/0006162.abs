  We construct a fourth-order derivative CP(N) model in 1+1 dimensions by
incorporating the topological charge density squared term into the Lagrangian.
We quantize the theory by reformulating with auxiliary fields and then
performing the path integral explicitly. We discuss the renormalizability in
the large N limit and relevance of the effective action with axion physics.
