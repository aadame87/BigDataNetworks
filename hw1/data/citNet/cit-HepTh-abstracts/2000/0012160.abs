  We discuss the junction conditions in the context of the Randall-Sundrum
model with the Gauss-Bonnet interaction. We consider the $Z_2$ symmetric model
where the brane is embedded in an $AdS_5$ bulk, as well as a model without
$Z_2$ symmetry in which the brane (in this case called by tradition ``shell'')
separates two metrically different $AdS_5$ regions. We show that the Israel
junction conditions across the membrane (that is either a brane or a shell)
have to be modified if more general equations than Einstein's, including higher
curvature terms, hold in the bulk, as is likely to be the case in a low energy
limit of string theory. We find that the membrane can then no longer be treated
in the thin wall approximation. We derive the junction conditions for the
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory including second order curvature terms and show
that the microphysics of Gauss-Bonnet thick membranes may, in some instances,
be simply hidden in a renormalization of Einstein's constant.
