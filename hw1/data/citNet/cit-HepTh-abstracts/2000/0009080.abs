  A massless spinor field is quantized in the background of a singular static
magnetic vortex in 2+1-dimensional space-time. The method of self-adjoint
extensions is employed to define the most general set of physically acceptable
boundary conditions at the location of the vortex. Under these conditions, the
vacuum energy density and effective potential in the vortex background are
determined.
