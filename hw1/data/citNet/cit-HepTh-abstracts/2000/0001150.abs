  of interacting brane system

  Seminar ''Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries' (SQS'99, 27-31 July, 1999)

  We present a supersymmetric action functional for the coupled system of an
open fundamental superstring and super-D0-branes attached to (identified with)
the string endpoints. As a preliminary step the geometrical actions for a free
super-D0-brane and a free type IIA superstring have been built. The pure
bosonic limits of the action for the coupled system and of the equations of
motion are discussed in some detail.
