  Although the AdS/CFT correspondence is rigorous only for an infinite $N \to
\infty$ stack of D3-branes, it can be fruitfully studied for finite $N$ as a
source of gauge structures and choices for chiral fermions and complex scalars
which solve the hierarchy problem by a conformal fixed point. We emphasize
orbifolds $AdS_5 \times S^5/\Gamma$ where the resulting GFT has ${\cal N} = 0$
supersymmetry. The fact that the complex scalars are prescribed by the
construction limits the possible spontaneous symmetry breaking. Both abelian
and nonabelian $\Gamma$ are illustrated by simple examples. An accurate $sin^2
\theta$ in electroweak unification can be obtained, suggesting that this
approach merits further study.
