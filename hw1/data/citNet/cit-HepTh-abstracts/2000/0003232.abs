  We give a perturbative quantization of space-time $R^4$ in the case where the
commutators $C^{{\mu}{\nu}}=[X^{\mu},X^{\nu}]$ of the underlying algebra
generators are not central . We argue that this kind of quantum space-times can
be used as regulators for quantum field theories . In particular we show in the
case of the ${\phi}^4$ theory that by choosing appropriately the commutators
$C^{{\mu}{\nu}}$ we can remove all the infinities by reproducing all the
counter terms . In other words the renormalized action on $R^4$ plus the
counter terms can be rewritten as only a renormalized action on the quantum
space-time $QR^4$ . We conjecture therefore that renormalization of quantum
field theory is equivalent to the quantization of the underlying space-time
$R^4$ .
