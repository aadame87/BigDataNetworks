  We study the Kaluza-Klein zero modes of massless bulk fields with various
spins in the background of dilatonic and self-tuning flat domain walls. We find
that the zero modes of all the massless bulk fields in such domain wall
backgrounds are normalizable, unlike those in the background of the
non-dilatonic domain wall with infinite extra space of Randall and Sundrum. In
particular, gravity in the bulk of dilatonic domain walls is effectively
compactified to the Einstein gravity with vanishing cosmological constant and
nonzero gravitational constant in one lower dimensions for any values of
dilaton coupling parameter, provided the warp factor is chosen to decrease on
both sides of the domain wall, in which case the tension of the domain wall is
positive. However, unexpectedly, for the self-tuning flat domain walls, the
cosmological constant of the zero mode effective gravity action in one lower
dimensions does not vanish, indicating the need for additional ingredient or
modification necessary in cancellation of the unexpected cosmological constant
in the graviton zero mode effective action.
