  We investigate the possibility of having the electrically charged
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in the gravity localized models in a brane world.
It is shown that the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole exists as a solution in the
5D Randall-Sundrum domain wall model if there is the U(1) bulk gauge field. We
find that the charged black hole is localized on a 3-brane even if zero mode of
the bulk gauge field is not in general localized on the brane in the domain
wall model. Moreover, we extend these observations to the higher-dimensional
topological defect models with codimension more than one in a general
space-time dimension such as the string-like defect model with codimension 2 in
six dimensions and the monopole-like defect model with codimension 3 in seven
dimensions e.t.c.
