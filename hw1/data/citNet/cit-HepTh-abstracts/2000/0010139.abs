  We analyze the superfield constraints of the D=4, N=3 SYM-theory using
light-cone gauge conditions. The SU(3)/U(1)xU(1) harmonic variables are
interpreted as auxiliary spectral parameters, and the transform to the
harmonic-superspace representation is considered. Our nilpotent gauge for the
basic harmonic superfield simplifies the SYM-equations of motion. A partial
Grassmann decomposition of these equations yields the solvable linear system of
iterative equations.
