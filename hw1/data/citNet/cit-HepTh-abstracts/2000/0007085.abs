  In the Kaluza - Klein approach the (4+d)-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert
gravity action is considered. The extra d-dimensional manifold V_d is a Riemann
space with the d-parametric group of isometry $G_d$ which acts on V_d by the
left shifts and with arbitrary nondegenerated left-invariant metric g_{ab}. The
gauge fields A_{\mu} are introduced as the affine connection coefficients of
the fibre bundle with V_d being the fibre. The effective Lagrangian as
invariant integral over extra-dimensional manifold of the curvative scalar of
mentioned structure is obtained. It is shown that such effective Lagrangian
contains beside the square of gauge field strength tensor also quadratic form
of A_{\mu} and all other fields have only pure gauge degrees of freedom when
g_{ab}. satisfy some conditions. This conditions may be regarded as
generalization of the General Relativity Principle to the extra dimensions. The
eigenvalues of the quadratic form of A_{\mu} are calculated for the case of
gauge group SO(3). It is shown that they are not equal to zero in the case when
g_{ab} is not proportional to the unit matrix.
