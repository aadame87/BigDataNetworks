  We investigate boundary states of N=2 coset models based on Grassmannians
Gr(n,n+k), and find that the underlying intersection geometry is given by the
fusion ring of U(n). This is isomorphic to the quantum cohomology ring of
Gr(n,n+k+1), and thus can be encoded in a ``boundary'' superpotential whose
critical points correspond to the boundary states. In this way the intersection
properties can be represented in terms of a soliton graph that forms a
generalized, Z_{n+k+1} symmetric McKay quiver. We investigate the spectrum of
bound states and find that the rational boundary CFT produces only a small
subset of the possible quiver representations.
