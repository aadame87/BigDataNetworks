  The general solution of the anomaly consistency condition (Wess-Zumino
equation) has been found recently for Yang-Mills gauge theory. The general form
of the counterterms arising in the renormalization of gauge invariant operators
(Kluberg-Stern and Zuber conjecture) and in gauge theories of the Yang-Mills
type with non power counting renormalizable couplings has also been worked out
in any number of spacetime dimensions. This Physics Report is devoted to
reviewing in a self-contained manner these results and their proofs. This
involves computing cohomology groups of the differential introduced by Becchi,
Rouet, Stora and Tyutin, with the sources of the BRST variations of the fields
("antifields") included in the problem. Applications of this computation to
other physical questions (classical deformations of the action, conservation
laws) are also considered. The general algebraic techniques developed in the
Report can be applied to other gauge theories, for which relevant references
are given.
