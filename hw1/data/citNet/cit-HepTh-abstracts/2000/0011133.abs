  "Equivalent unconstrained systems" for QCD obtained by resolving the Gauss
law are discussed. We show that the effects of hadronization, confinement,
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and $\eta_0$-meson mass can be hidden in
solutions of the non-Abelian Gauss constraint in the class of functions of
topological gauge transformations, in the form of a monopole, a zero mode of
the Gauss law, and a rising potential.
