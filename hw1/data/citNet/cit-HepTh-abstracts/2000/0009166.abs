  We construct the manifestly Lorenz-invariant formulation of the N=1 D=4
massive superparticle with tensorial central charges. The model contains a real
parameter k and at $k\ne 0$ possesses one $\kappa$-symmetry while at k=0 the
number of $\kappa$-symmetry is two. The equivalence of the formulations at all
$k\ne 0$ is obtained. The local transformations of $\kappa$-symmetry are
written out. It is considered the using of index spinor for construction of the
tensorial central charges. It is obtained the equivalence at classical level
between the massive D=4 superparticle with one $\kappa$-symmetry and the
massive D=4 spinning particle
