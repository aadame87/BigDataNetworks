  The construction of the fusion ring of a quasi-rational CFT based on
$\hat{sl}(3)_k$ at generic level $k\not \in {\Bbb Q}$ is reviewed. It is a
commutative ring generated by formal characters, elements in the group ring
${\Bbb Z}[\tilde{W}]$ of the extended affine Weyl group $\tilde{W}$ of
$\hat{sl}(3)_k$. Some partial results towards the $\hat{sl}(4)_k$
generalisation of this character ring are presented.
