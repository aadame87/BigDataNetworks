  A submodel of the so-called conformal affine Toda model coupled to the matter
field (CATM) is defined such that its real Lagrangian has a positive-definite
kinetic term for the Toda field and a usual kinetic term for the (Dirac) spinor
field. After spontaneously broken the conformal symmetry by means of BRST
analysis, we end up with an effective theory, the off-critical affine Toda
model coupled to the matter (ATM). It is shown that the ATM model inherits the
remarkable properties of the general CATM model such as the soliton solutions,
the particle/soliton correspondence and the equivacence between the Noether and
topological currents. The classical solitonic spectrum of the ATM model is also
discussed.
