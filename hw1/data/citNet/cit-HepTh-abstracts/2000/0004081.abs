  The microscopic spectral correlations of the Dirac operator in Yang-Mills
theories coupled to fermions in (2+1) dimensions can be related to three
universality classes of Random Matrix Theory. In the microscopic limit the
Orthogonal Ensemble (OE) corresponds to a theory with 2 colors and fermions in
the fundamental representation and the Symplectic Ensemble (SE) corresponds to
an arbitrary number of colors and fermions in the adjoint representation. Using
a new method of Widom, we derive an expression for the two scalar kernels which
through quaternion determinants give all spectral correlation functions in the
Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) and in the the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble
(GSE) with all fermion masses equal to zero. The result for the GOE is valid
for an arbitrary number of fermions while for the GSE we have results for an
even number of fermions.
