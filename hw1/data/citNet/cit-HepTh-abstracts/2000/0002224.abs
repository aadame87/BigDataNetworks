Title: A Novel Superstring in Four Dimensions and Grand Unification

  A string in four dimensions is constructed by supplementing it with forty
four Majorana fermions. The central charge is 26. The fermions are grouped in
such a way that the resulting action is supersymmetric. The energy momentum and
current generators satisfy the super-Virasoro algebra. The tachyonic ground
state decouples from the physical states. GSO projections are necessary for
proving modular invariance. Space-time supersymmetry provides reasons to
discard the tachyons and is substantiated for modes of zero mass. The symmetry
group of the model descends to the low energy standard model group $SU (3)
\times SU_L (2) \times U_Y (1)$ through the Pati-Salam group. Left right
symmetry is broken spontaneously and the mass of the tau neutrino is calculated
to be about 1/25 electron volt.
