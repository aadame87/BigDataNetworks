  The q-field theories are constructed by substituting quantum groups for the
usual Lie groups. In earlier papers this construction was carried out for the
quantum group SU_q(2). Here the investigation is extended to SL_q(3). The
resulting theory describes two sectors, one sector lying close to the standard
theory and accessible by perturbation theory, while the second sector describes
particles that should be difficult to detect and become invisible in the q=1
limit. In this note we discuss these hypothetical particles: three quark-like
spinor particles coupled to three gluon-like vector particles.
