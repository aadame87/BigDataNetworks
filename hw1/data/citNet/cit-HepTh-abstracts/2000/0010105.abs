  In this paper we show how two dimensional electron systems can be modeled by
strings interacting with D-branes. The dualities of string theory allow several
descriptions of the system. These include descriptions in terms of solitons in
the near horizon D6-brane theory, non-commutative gauge theory on a D2-brane,
the Matrix Theory of D0-branes and finally as a giant graviton in M-theory. The
soliton can be described as a D2-brane with an incompressible fluid of
D0-branes and charged string-ends moving on it. Including an NS5 brane in the
system allows for the existence of an edge with the characteristic massless
chiral edge states of the Quantum Hall system.
