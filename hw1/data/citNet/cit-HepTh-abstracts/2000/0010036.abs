  In terms of group orbifold elements with definite monodromy, we give a
construction for the action functionals of the twisted sectors of all WZW
orbifolds. Surprisingly, locality of the theory dictates a form of the general
twisted current algebra in which the twisted right and left mover current
algebras are not a priori copies of each other. For the permutation orbifolds
and the inner-automorphic orbifolds we are able to show by a mode relabelling
that the situation is equivalent to copies, but we do not have an argument that
this is always the case. In an extension, we also construct the actions for all
the orbifolds of any nonlinear sigma model with a symmetry which acts linearly
on the coordinates. Finally, implications for orbifold conformal field theory
are discussed, including a conjectured set of orbifold Einstein equations for
those sigma model orbifolds in this class which are also 1-loop conformal.
