  Starting with Lagrangians, which turn out to be degenerate, the Hamiltonian
operators for integrable systems can be constructed using Dirac's theory of
constraints. We illustrate this by giving a systematic discussion of the first
Hamiltonian structure of KdV. The first symplectic 2-form obtained from Dirac's
theory is the time component of the covariant Witten-Zuckerman symplectic
2-form current. We derive the flux of the first symplectic 2-form. Then we turn
to a new Lagrangian for KdV recently obtained by Pavlov and present the
corresponding new covariant symplectic structure for KdV. This shows that the
inverse of Magri's second Hamiltonian operator is also a Hamiltonian operator
for KdV.
