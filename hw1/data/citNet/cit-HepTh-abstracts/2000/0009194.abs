  This work consist of two interrelated parts. First, we derive massive
gauge-invariant generalizations of geometric actions on coadjoint orbits of
arbitrary (infinite-dimensional) groups $G$ with central extensions, with gauge
group $H$ being certain (infinite-dimensional) subgroup of $G$. We show that
there exist generalized ``zero-curvature'' representation of the pertinent
equations of motion on the coadjoint orbit. Second, in the special case of $G$
being Kac-Moody group the equations of motion of the underlying gauged WZNW
geometric action are identified as additional-symmetry flows of generalized
Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies based on the loop algebra ${\hat \cG}$.
For ${\hat \cG} = {\hat {SL}}(M+R)$ the latter hiearchies are equivalent to a
class of constrained (reduced) KP hierarchies called ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$, which
contain as special cases a series of well-known integrable systems (mKdV, AKNS,
Fordy-Kulish, Yajima-Oikawa etc.). We describe in some detail the loop algebras
of additional (non-isospectral) symmetries of ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$ hierarchies.
Apart from gauged WZNW models, certain higher-dimensional nonlinear systems
such as Davey-Stewartson and $N$-wave resonant systems are also identified as
additional symmetry flows of ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$ hierarchies. Along the way we
exhibit explicitly the interrelation between the Sato pseudo-differential
operator formulation and the algebraic (generalized) Drinfeld-Sokolov
formulation of ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$ hierarchies. Also we present the explicit
derivation of the general Darboux-B\"acklund solutions of ${\sl cKP}_{R,M}$
preserving their additional (non-isospectral) symmetries, which for R=1 contain
among themselves solutions to the gauged $SL(M+1)/U(1)\times SL(M)$ WZNW field
equations.
