  We give an explicit $L^2$-representation of chiral charged fermions using the
Hardy-Lebesgue octant decomposition. In the " pure" case such a representation
was already used by M. Sato in holonomic field theory. We study both "pure" and
" mixed" cases. In the compact case we rigorously define unsmeared chiral
charged fermion operators inside the unit circle. Using chiral fermions we
orient our findings towards a functional analytic study of vertex algebras as
one dimensional quantum field theory.
