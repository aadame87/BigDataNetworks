  Motivated by recent work we study rotating ellipsoidal membranes in the
framework of the light-cone supermembrane theory. We investigate stability
properties of these classical solutions which are important for the
quantization of super membranes. We find the stability modes for all sectors of
small multipole deformations. We exhibit an isomorphism of the linearized
membrane equation with that of the SU(N) matrix model for every value of $N$.
The boundaries of the linearized stability region are at a finite distance and
they appear for finite size perturbations.
