  We show that the dilaton and T-moduli can be stabilized by a single gaugino
condensation mechanism in the four-dimensional effective field theory derived
from Type IIB orientifolds. A crucial role is played by the mixing of the
blowing-up modes Mk with the T-moduli in the Kahler metric, and by the presence
of the Mk in the gauge kinetic functions. Supersymmetry breaking in these
models is dominated by the auxiliary fields of the T moduli, and
phenomenologically interesting patterns can emerge.
