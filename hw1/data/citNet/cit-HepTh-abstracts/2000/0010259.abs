  We introduce and solve a generalized model of 1+1D Lorentzian triangulations
in which a certain subclass of outgrowths is allowed, the occurrence of these
being governed by a coupling constant \beta. Combining transfer matrix-, saddle
point- and path integral techniques we show that for \beta<1 it is possible to
take a continuum limit in which the model is described by a 1D quantum Calogero
Hamiltonian. The coupling constant \beta survives the continuum limit and
appears as a parameter of the Calogero potential.
