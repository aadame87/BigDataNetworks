Title: Partial supersymmetry breaking in Multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM
Authors: E. E. Donets, A. Pashnev, J.J. Rosales and M. Tsulaia
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX
\\
  The multidimensional N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) is
constructed and the various possibilities for partial supersymmetry breaking
are discussed. It is shown that quantum mechanical models with one quarter, one
half and three quarters of unbroken(broken) supersymmetries can exist in the
framework of the multidimensional N=4 SUSY QM.
