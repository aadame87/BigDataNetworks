  One of explanations of the black hole entropy implies that gravity is
entirely induced by quantum effects. By using arguments based on the AdS/CFT
correspondence we give induced gravity interpretation of the gravity in a brane
world in higher dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The underlying quantum
theory is SU(N) theory where $N$ is related to the CFT central charge. The
theory includes massless fields which correspond to degrees of freedom of the
boundary CFT. In addition, on the brane there are massive degrees of freedom
with masses proportional to $l^{-1}$ where $l$ is the radius of AdS. At the
conformal boundary of AdS they are infinitely heavy and completely decouple. It
is the massive fields which can explain the black hole entropy. We support our
interpretation by a microscopic model of a 2D brane world in $AdS_3$.
