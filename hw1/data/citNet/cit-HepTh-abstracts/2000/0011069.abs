  A generalization of the Coulomb Gas model with modular SL(2, Z)-symmetry
allows for a discrete infinity of phases which are characterized by the
condensation of dyonic pseudoparticles and the breaking of parity and time
reversal. Here we study the phase diagram of such a model by using
renormalization group techniques. Then the symmetry SL(2,Z) acting on the
two-dimensional parameter space gives us a nested shape of its global phase
diagram and all the infrared stable fixed points. Finally we propose a
connection with the 2-dimensional Conformal Field Theory description of the
Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.
