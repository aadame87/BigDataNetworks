  The model of point particle in general external fields is considered and the
generalized equivalence principle is suggested identifying all backgrounds
which give rise to equivalent particle dynamics. The equivalence
transformations for external fields are interpreted as gauge ones. The gauge
group appears to be a semidirect product of all phase space canonical
transformations to an abelian ideal of "hyperWeyl" transformations and includes
U(1) and general coordinate symmetries as a subgroup. The implications of this
gauge symmetry are considered and a connection of general backgrounds to the
infinite collection of Fronsdal gauge fields is studied. Although the result is
negative and no direct connection arises, it is discussed how higher spin
fields could be found among general external fields if one relaxes somehow the
equivalence principle. Besides, the particle action in general backgrounds is
shown to reproduce the De Wit-Freedman point particle -- symmetric tensors
first order interaction suggested many years ago, and generalizes their result
to all orders in interaction.
