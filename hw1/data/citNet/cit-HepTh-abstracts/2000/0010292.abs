  We discuss toroidal compactifications of maximal supergravity coupled to an
extended configuration of BPS states which transform consistently under the
U-duality group. Under certain conditions this leads to theories that live in
more than eleven spacetime dimensions, with maximal supersymmetry but only
partial Lorentz invariance. We demonstrate certain features of this
construction for the case of nine-dimensional N=2 supergravity.
