  We calculate the absorption probabilities for a class of massless fields
whose linear perturbations leave the near-extremal D3-brane background metric
unperturbed. It has previously been found that, for extremal D3-branes, these
fields share the same absorption probability as that of the dilaton-axion. We
find that these absorption probabilities diverge from each other as we move
away from extremality. The form of the corresponding effective Schrodinger
potentials leads us to conjecture that the absorption of various fields by
nonextremal D3-branes depends on the polarization of angular momentum.
