  We study cosmological solutions in the dilatonic brane world models. The
effective four-dimensional equations on the brane are analyzed for the models
with one positive tension brane and two branes with tensions of opposite signs.
Just as in the non-dilatonic brane case, the conventional Friedmann equations
of the four-dimensional universe are reproduced to the leading order in matter
energy density for the model with one brane and the introduction of a radion
potential is required in order to reproduce the Friedmann equations with the
correct sign for the model with two branes.
