  We study the radiative corrections to the Chern-Simons mass term at two loops
in 2+1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature. We show that,
in contrast to the behavior at zero temperature, thermal effects lead to a non
vanishing contribution at this order. Using this result, as well as the large
gauge Ward identity for the leading parity violating terms in the static limit,
we determine the leading order parity violating effective action in this limit
at two loops, which generalizes the one-loop effective action proposed earlier.
