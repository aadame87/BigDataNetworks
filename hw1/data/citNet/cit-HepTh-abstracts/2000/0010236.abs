  We introduce two simple models which feature an Alice electrodynamics phase.
In a well defined sense the Alice flux solutions we obtain in these models obey
first order equations similar to those of the Nielsen-Olesen fluxtube in the
abelian higgs model in the Bogomol'nyi limit. Some numerical solutions are
presented as well.
