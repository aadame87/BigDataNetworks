  A plausible physical interpretation of the renormalizability condition is
given. It is shown that renormalizable quantum field theories describe such
systems wherein the tendency to collapse associated with vacuum fluctuations of
attractive forces is suppressed by vacuum fluctuations of kinetic energy.
Relaying on the classification of topological types of evolution of point
particles and analysing the problem of the fall to the centre, we obtain a
general criterion for preventability of collapse which states that the spectrum
of the Hamiltonian must be bounded from below. The holographic principle is
used to explain the origin of anomalies and make precise the relation between
the renormalizability and the reversibility.
