  We investigate the oblique vacua in the perturbed 2+1 dimensional gauge
theory living on D2 branes. The string theory dual of these vacua is expected
to correspond to polarizations of the D2 branes into NS5 branes with D4 brane
charge. We perturb the gauge theory by adding fermions masses. In the
nonsupersymmetric case, we also consider the effect of slight variations of the
masses of the scalars. For certain ranges of scalar masses we find oblique
vacua.
  We show that D4 charge is an essential ingredient in understanding D2 -> NS5
polarizations. We find that some of the polarization states which appear as
metastable vacua when D4 charge is not considered are in fact unstable. They
decay by acquiring D4 charge, tilting and shrinking to zero size.
