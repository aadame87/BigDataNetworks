Title: Integrable hierarchies from BRST-anti-BRST gauge-fixing
Authors: V. Calian
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  The BRST formulation is used in order to derive the existence criterion for
classical bi-Hamiltonian systems, based on non-anomalous deformation of the
gauge-fixing structure. The recursion operator is then used to provide the
entire hierarchy of integrable models associated to the original BRST and
anti-BRST charges.
