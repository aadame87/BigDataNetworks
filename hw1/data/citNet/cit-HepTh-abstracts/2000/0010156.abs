  We present solution generating techniques which permit to construct exact
inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmological solutions to a four-dimensional low
energy limit of string theory containing non-minimally interacting
electromagnetic and dilaton fields. Some explicit homogeneous and inhomogeneous
cosmological solutions are constructed. For example, inhomogeneous exact
solutions presenting Gowdy - type EMD universe are obtained. The asymptotic
behaviour of the solutions is investigated. The asymptotic form of the metric
near the initial singularity has a spatially varying Kasner form. The character
of the space-time singularities is discussed. The late evolution of the
solutions is described by a background homogeneous and anisotropic universe
filled with weakly interacting gravitational, dilatonic and electromagnetic
waves.
