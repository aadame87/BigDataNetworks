  The renormalization group flow of an integrable two dimensional quantum field
theory which contains unstable particles is investigated. The analysis is
carried out for the Virasoro central charge and the conformal dimensions as a
function of the renormalization group flow parameter. This allows to identify
the corresponding conformal field theories together with their operator content
when the unstable particles vanish from the particle spectrum. The specific
model considered is the $SU(3)_{2}$-homogeneous Sine-Gordon model.
