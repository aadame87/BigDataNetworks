  Compactification of M theory in the presence of G-fluxes yields N=2
five-dimensional gauged supergravity with a potential that lifts all
supersymmetric vacua. We derive the effective superpotential directly from the
Kaluza-Klein reduction of the eleven-dimensional action on a Calabi-Yau
three-fold and compare it with the superpotential obtained by means of
calibrations. We discuss an explicit domain wall solution, which represents
five-branes wrapped over holomorphic cycles. This solution has a ``running
volume'' and we comment on the possibility that quantum corrections provide a
lower bound allowing for an AdS_5 vacuum of the 5-dimensional supergravity.
