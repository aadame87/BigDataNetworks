Comments: 21 pages, latex, no figures, Based on the talks given at QFTHEP'99
  (Moscow, May 1999), Supersymmetries and Quantum Symmetries (Dubna, July
  1999), Bogolyubov Conference Problems of Theoretical and Mathematical Physics
  (Moscow-Dubna-Kyiv, Sept-Oct. 1999) and Symmetry and Integrability in
  Mathematical and Theoretical Physics, the Conference in Memory of

  We discuss general properties of the theory of higher spin gauge fields in
$AdS_4$ focusing on the relationship between the star-product origin of the
higher spin symmetries, AdS geometry and the concept of space-time locality. A
full list of conserved higher spin currents in the flat space of arbitrary
dimension is presented.
