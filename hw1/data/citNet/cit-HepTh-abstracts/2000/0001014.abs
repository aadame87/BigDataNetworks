  In this thesis quantum gauge theories are considered in the framework of
local, causal perturbation theory. Gauge invariance is described in terms of
the BRS formalism. Local interacting field operators are constructed
perturbatively and field equations are established. A nilpotent BRS
transformation is defined on the local algebra of fields. It allows the
definition of the algebra of local observables as an operator cohomology. This
algebra of local observables can be represented in a Hilbert space.
  The interacting field operators are defined in terms of time ordered products
of free field operators. For the results above to hold the time ordered
products must satisfy certain normalization conditions. To formulate these
conditions also for field operators that contain a spacetime derivative a
suitable mathematical description of time ordered products is developed.
  Among the normalization conditions are Ward identities for the ghost current
and the BRS current. The latter are generalizations of a normalization
condition that is postulated by D"utsch, Hurth, Krahe and Scharf for Yang-Mills
theory. It is not yet proven that this condition has a solution in every order.
All other normalization conditions can be accomplished simultaneously.
  A principle for the correspondence between interacting quantum fields and
interacting classical fields is established. Quantum electrodynamics and
Yang-Mills theory are examined and the results are compared with the
literature.
