  On a noncommutative space of rank-1, we construct a codimension-one soliton
explicitly and, in the context of noncommutative bosonic open string field
theory, identify it with the D24-brane. We compute the tension of the proposed
D24-brane, yielding an exact value and show that it is related to the tension
of the codimension two D23-brane by the string T-duality. This resolves an
apparent puzzle posed by the result of Harvey, Kraus, Larsen and Martinec and
proves that the T-duality is a gauge symmetry; in particular, at strong
noncommutativity, it is part of the U(oo) gauge symmetry on the worldvolume. We
also apply the result to non-BPS D-branes in superstring theories and argue
that the codimension-one soliton gives rise to new descent relation among the
non-BPS D-branes in Type IIA and Type IIB string theories via T-duality.
