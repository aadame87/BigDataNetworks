  We show that dilaton beta-function equation in the brane-like sigma-model
(regarded as NSR analogue of string theory on $AdS_5\times{S^5}$) has the form
of stochastic Langevin equation with non-Markovian noise. The worldsheet cutoff
is identified with stochastic time and the $V_5$-operator plays the role of the
noise. We derive the Fokker-Planck equation associated with this stochastic
process and show that the Hamiltonian of the $AdS_5$ supergravity defines the
distribution satisfying this Fokker-Planck equation. This means that the
dynamical compactification of flat ten-dimensional space-time on
$AdS_5\times{S^5}$ occurs as a result of the non-Markovian stochastic process,
generated by the $V_5$-operator noise. This provides us with an insight into
relation between holography principle and the concept of stochastic
quantization from the point of view of critical string theory.
