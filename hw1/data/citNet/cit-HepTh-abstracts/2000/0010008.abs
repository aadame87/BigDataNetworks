  It is known that the one-loop effective action of ${QED}_2$ is a quadratic in
the field strength when the fermion mass is zero: all potential higher order
contributions beyond second order vanish. For nonzero fermion mass it is shown
that this behavior persists for a general class of fields for at least one
value of the fermion mass when the external field's flux $\Phi$ satisfies
$0<|e\Phi|<2\pi$. For ${QED}_4$ with (anti-) self-dual fields the mass-shell
renormalized one-loop effective action vanishes for at least one value of the
fermion mass provided a plausible zero-mass limit exists.
