Title: Light as Caused by Neither by Bound States nor by Neutrinos
Authors: Kurt Just and Kam-Yuen Kwong and Zbigniew Oziewicz
Comments: 8 pages
\\
  Participants of this workshop pursue the old Neutrino Theory of Light
vigorously. Other physicists have long ago abandoned it, because it lacks gauge
invariance. In the recent Quantum Induction (QI), all basic Bose fields
${\mathcal B}^{P}$ are local limits of quantum fields composed of Dirac's
$\Psi$ (for leptons and quarks). The induced field equations of QI even
determine all the interactions of those ${\mathcal B}^{P}$. Thus a precise
gauge invariance and other physical consequences are unavoidable. They include
the absence of divergencies, the exclusion of Pauli terms, a prediction of the
Higgs mass and a `minimal' Quantum Gravity.
  As we find in this paper, however, photons can't be bound states while
Maxwell's potential $A_{\mu}$ contains all basic Dirac fields except those of
neutrinos.
