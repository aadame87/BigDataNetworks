  We discuss some formal aspects of quantum anomalies with an emphasis on the
regularization of field theory. We briefly review how ambiguities in
perturbation theory have been resolved by various regularization schemes. To
single out the true quantum anomaly among ambiguities, the combined ideas of
PCAC, soft pion limit and renormalizability were essential. As for the formal
treatment of quantum anomalies, we mainly discuss the path integral formulation
both in continuum and lattice theories. In particular, we discuss in some
detail the recent development in the treatment of chiral anomalies in lattice
gauge theory.
