  The relationship is established between the Fedosov deformation quantization
of a general symplectic manifold and the BFV-BRST quantization of constrained
dynamical systems. The original symplectic manifold $\mathcal M$ is presented
as a second class constrained surface in the fibre bundle ${{\mathcal
T}^*_\rho}{\mathcal M}$ which is a certain modification of a usual cotangent
bundle equipped with a natural symplectic structure. The second class system is
converted into the first class one by continuation of the constraints into the
extended manifold, being a direct sum of ${{\mathcal T}^*_\rho}{\mathcal M}$
and the tangent bundle $T {\mathcal M}$. This extended manifold is equipped
with a nontrivial Poisson bracket which naturally involves two basic
ingredients of Fedosov geometry: the symplectic structure and the symplectic
connection. The constructed first class constrained theory, being equivalent to
the original symplectic manifold, is quantized through the BFV-BRST procedure.
The existence theorem is proven for the quantum BRST charge and the quantum
BRST invariant observables. The adjoint action of the quantum BRST charge is
identified with the Abelian Fedosov connection while any observable, being
proven to be a unique BRST invariant continuation for the values defined in the
original symplectic manifold, is identified with the Fedosov flat section of
the Weyl bundle. The Fedosov fibrewise star multiplication is thus recognized
as a conventional product of the quantum BRST invariant observables.
