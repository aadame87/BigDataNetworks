  We investigate asymptotic behaviors of the strong coupling limit in the N=2
supersymmetric non-commutative Yang-Mills theory. The strong coupling behavior
is quite different from the commutative one since the non-commutative dual U(1)
theory is asymptotic free, although the monodoromy is the same as that of the
ordinary theory. Singularities are produced by infinitely heavy monopoles and
dyons. Nonperturbative corrections may be determined by holomorphy.
