  We study the elliptic C_n and BC_n Ruijsenaars-Schneider models which is
elliptic generalization of system given in hep-th/0006004. The Lax pairs for
these models are constructed by Hamiltonian reduction technology. We show that
the spectral curves can be parameterized by the involutive integrals of motion
for these models. Taking nonrelativistic limit and scaling limit, we verify
that they lead to the systems corresponding to Calogero-Moser and Toda types.
