  Higher dimensional Majorana-Weyl spacetimes present space-time dualities
which are induced by the Spin(8) triality automorphisms. This corresponds to a
very fundamental property of the supersymmetry in higher dimensions, i.e. that
any given theory can be formulated in different signatures all interconnected
by the S_3 permutation group.
