Title: The dynamics of zeros of the elliptic solutions to the Schrodinger
  equation

  J. F. van Diejen and H. Puschmann have recently shown that the dynamics of
zeros of the n-solitonic solutions to the Schrodinger equation with the
reflectionless potential is governed by a rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider
system. We use the algebraic-geometrical construction of solutions to the
Schrodinger equation to generalize this result to the elliptic case.
