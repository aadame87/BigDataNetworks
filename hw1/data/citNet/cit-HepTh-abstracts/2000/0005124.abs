  We study the bulk effective theory of a class of orbifolds of the type IIB
string with D5-branes, compactified to four dimensions. These constructions are
connected, in a region of their moduli space, to some orbifolds of the type I
and heterotic string. We compare the effective actions through the coupling of
the R^2 term, and we argue that these orbifolds provide non-perturbative
deformations of the latter, in which the gauge group is entirely
non-perturbative.
