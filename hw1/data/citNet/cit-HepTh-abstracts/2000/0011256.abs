  We show how a recently proposed large $N$ duality in the context of type IIA
strings with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry in 4 dimensions can be derived from
purely geometric considerations by embedding type IIA strings in M-theory. The
phase structure of M-theory on $G_2$ holonomy manifolds and an $S^3$ flop are
the key ingredients in this derivation.
