  We discuss Wilson loop averages in 4-dimensional non-commutative
superYang-Mills theory using the dual supergravity description. We postulate
that the Wilson loops are located at the mimimum length scale $R$ in the fifth
radial coordinate. We find that they exhibit a crossover from Coulomb type of
behaviour for large loops, for which non-commutativity is unimportant, to area
law for small loops, for which non-commutativity effects are large. The string
tension, which can be read off from the area law, is controlled by the
non-commutativity scale. The crossover itself, however, appears to involve
loops of size of order $R$ which is much larger than the non-commutativity
scale. The existence of the area law in non-commutative super Yang-Mills theory
which persists up to a large crossover length scale provides further evidence
for connection to an underlying string theory.
