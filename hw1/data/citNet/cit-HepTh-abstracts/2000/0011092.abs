  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we show that the Anti-de Sitter (AdS)
rotating (Kerr) black holes in five and seven dimensions provide us with
examples of non-trivial field theories which are scale, but not conformally
invariant. This is demonstrated by our computation of the actions and the
stress-energy tensors of the four and six dimensional field theories residing
on the boundary of these Kerr-AdS black holes spacetimes.
