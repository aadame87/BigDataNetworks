  We consider the motion of the brane universe moving in a background bulk
space of tachyonic and non-tachyonic type 0B string theory. The effective
densities are calculated for both cases and they show different power law
behavior. Brane inflation for non-tachyonic type 0B background has the same
power law behavior as that for type IIB background. The brane inflation under
tachyonic background is less divergent than the one without tachyon. The role
of tachyonic field in brane inflation scenario is different from that of the
ordinary matter field.
