  The only calculations performed beyond one-loop level in the light-cone gauge
make use of the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt (ML) prescription in order to circumvent
the notorious gauge dependent poles. Recently we have shown that in the context
of negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) such prescription can be
altogether abandoned, at least in one-loop order calculations. We extend our
approach, now studying two-loop integrals pertaining to two-point functions.
While previous works on the subject present only divergent parts for the
integrals, we show that our prescriptionless method gives the same results for
them, besides finite parts for arbitrary exponents of propagators.
