  We find all possible static embeddings of a 4-brane in any dimension-6
spacetime with 4-dimensional Poincare symmetry and a negative cosmological
constant, subject to orbifolding across the brane. Our new solutions allow
intersecting branes at an angle determined by a new dynamical parameter. A
collection of branes intersecting in one 3-brane allows an arbitrary excess
angle that can be related to a vacuum density along the intersection. The
3-brane must be stabilized by additional fine-tuned interactions. We also note
that localization of gravity is tied to the approximate fine tuning of the
brane tensions.
