  We overview some attempts to find S-duality analogues of non-supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory, in the context of gravity theories. The case of
MacDowell-Mansouri gauge theory of gravity is discussed. Three-dimensional
dimensional reductions from the topological gravitational sector in four
dimensions, enable to recuperate the 2+1 Chern-Simons gravity and the
corresponding S-dual theory, from the notion of self-duality in the
four-dimensional theory.
