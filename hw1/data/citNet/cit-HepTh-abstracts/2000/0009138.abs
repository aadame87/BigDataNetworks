Title: Remarks on Liouville theory with boundary
Authors: J. Teschner
Comments: Talk presented at TMR-conference "Nonperturbative Quantum Effects
  2000", 7 pages, LATEX with JHEP proceedings style
\\
  The bootstrap for Liouville theory with conformally invariant boundary
conditions will be discussed. After reviewing some results on one- and boundary
two-point functions we discuss some analogue of the Cardy condition linking
these data. This allows to determine the spectrum of the theory on the strip,
and illustrates in what respects the bootstrap for noncompact conformal field
theories with boundary is richer than in RCFT. We briefly indicate some
connections with $U_q(sl(2,R))$ that should help completing the bootstrap.
