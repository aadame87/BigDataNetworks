  The matrix elements of local operators such as the electromagnetic current,
the energy momentum tensor, angular momentum, and the moments of structure
functions have exact representations in terms of light-cone Fock state
wavefunctions of bound states such as hadrons. We illustrate all of these
properties by giving explicit light-cone wavefunctions for the two-particle
Fock state of the electron in QED, thus connecting the Schwinger anomalous
magnetic moment to the spin and orbital momentum carried by its Fock state
constituents. We also compute the QED one-loop radiative corrections for the
form factors for the graviton coupling to the electron and photon. Although the
underlying model is derived from elementary QED perturbative couplings, it in
fact can be used to simulate much more general bound state systems by applying
spectral integration over the constituent masses while preserving all of the
Lorentz properties, giving explicit realization of the spin sum rules and other
local matrix elements. The role of orbital angular momentum in understanding
the "spin crisis" problem for relativistic systems is clarified. We also prove
that the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment B(0) vanishes for any composite
system. This property is shown to follow directly from the Lorentz boost
properties of the light-cone Fock representation and holds separately for each
Fock state component. We show how the QED perturbative structure can be used to
model bound state systems while preserving all Lorentz properties. We thus
obtain a theoretical laboratory to test the consistency of formulae which have
been proposed to probe the spin structure of hadrons.
