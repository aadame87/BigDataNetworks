  We construct a model for dilatonic brane worlds with constant curvature on
the brane, i.e. a non-zero four-dimensional cosmological constant, given in
function of the dilaton coupling and the cosmological constant of the bulk. We
compare this family of solutions to other known dilatonic domain wall solutions
and apply a self-tunning mechanism to check the stability of our solutions
under quantum fluctuations living on the brane.
