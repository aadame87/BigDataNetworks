Title: Linear Inflation in Curvature-Quadratic Gravity
Authors: Paul Federbush (Univ. of Michigan)

  We continue our study of gravity described by the action density
(-g)^(1/2)(R_ik^2+bR^2); and look for cosmological solutions of gravity coupled
to dust, for the closed isotropic model. There is a solution that at t
approaches zero has for the radius, a(t)=t/3^(1/2); in the absence of dust this
solution holds for all time.
