  We study D=3 field theories on the D3-branes stretched between two NS5-branes
with NS B-field background. The theory is a noncommutative gauge theory. The
mirror symmetry and S-duality of the theory are discussed. A new feature is
that the mirror of the noncommutative gauge theory is not a field theory but an
open string decoupled from the closed string. We also consider brane creation
phenomena and use the result to discuss the analogue of the Seiberg duality. A
noncommutative soliton is interpreted as a D1-brane induced on D3-brane.
