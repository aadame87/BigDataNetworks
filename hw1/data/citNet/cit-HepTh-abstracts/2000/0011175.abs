  In this paper, we consider bosonic reduced Yang-Mills integrals by using some
approximation schemes, which are a kind of mean field approximation called
Gaussian approximation and its improved version. We calculate the free energy
and the expectation values of various operators including Polyakov loop and
Wilson loop. Our results nicely match to the exact and the numerical results
obtained before. Quite good scaling behaviors of the Polyakov loop and of the
Wilson loop can be seen under the 't Hooft like large $N$ limit for the case of
the loop length smaller. Then, simple analytic expressions for the loops are
obtained. Furthermore, we compute the Polyakov loop and the Wilson loop for the
case of the loop length sufficiently large, where with respect to the Polyakov
loop there seems to be no known results in appropriate literatures even in
numerical calculations. The result of the Wilson loop exhibits a strong
resemblance to the result simulated for a few smaller values of $N$ in the
supersymmetric case.
