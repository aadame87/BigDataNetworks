  We investigate D-branes on a noncompact singular Calabi-Yau manifold by using
the boundary CFT description, and calculate the open string Witten indices
between the boundary states. The B-type D-branes turn out to be characterized
by the properties of a compact positively curved manifold. We give geometric
interpretations to these boundary states in terms of coherent sheaves of the
manifold.
