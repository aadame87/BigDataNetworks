  We propose a new mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The
existence of extra dimensions with nontrivial topology plays an important role.
We investigate new features resulting from this mechanism. One noteworthy
feature is that there exists a phase in which the translational invariance for
the compactified directions is broken spontaneously. The mechanism we propose
also yields quite different vacuum structures for models with different global
symmetries.
