  Supersymmetry of five dimensional string solutions is examined in the context
of gauged D=5, N=2 supergravity coupled to abelian vector multiplets. We find
magnetic black strings preserving one quarter of supersymmetry and approaching
the half-supersymmetric product space AdS_3\times H^2 near the event horizon.
The solutions thus exhibit the phenomenon of supersymmetry enhancement near the
horizon, like in the cases of ungauged supergravity theories, where the near
horizon limit is fully supersymmetric. Finally, product space compactifications
are studied in detail, and it is shown that only for negative curvature
(hyperbolic) internal spaces, some amount of supersymmetry can be preserved.
Among other solutions, we find that the extremal rotating BTZ black hole
tensored by H^2 preserves one quarter of supersymmetry.
