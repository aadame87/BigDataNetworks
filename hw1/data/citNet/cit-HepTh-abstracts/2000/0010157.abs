  We establish that in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at zero temperature,
SU_(L+R)(N_F) exhibits the vector mode conjectured by Georgi and
SU_(L-R)(N_F)is realized in either the Nambu-Goldstone mode or else the
axial-vector charge is also screened from view at infinity. The Wigner-Weyl
mode is ruled out unless the beta function in QCD develops an infrared stable
zero.
