  We show that the fluxon solution of the non-commutative gauge theory and its
variations are obtained by the soliton generation method recently given by J.
A. Harvey, P. Kraus and F. Larsen [hep-th/0010060]. Although this method
generally produces non-BPS solutions of equations of motion, the solutions we
obtained are BPS. We give the brane interpretation of these BPS solutions and
study their counterparts in the ordinary description by the Seiberg-Witten map.
