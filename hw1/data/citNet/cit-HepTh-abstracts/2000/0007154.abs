  In AdS_n x S^m threaded by N-units of Ramond-Ramond flux, the dynamics of a
Dm-brane wrapped on S^{m-1} embedded in S^m is investigated. Under the
condition that flux of the dual gauge field on the D-brane worldvolume is
quantized integrally, It is found that the wrapped D-brane is stable both
locally and globally and, on AdS_n, behaves effectively as a fundamental
string. It is also claimed that the semi-infinite partially wrapped D-brane
`lasso' around the S^m.
