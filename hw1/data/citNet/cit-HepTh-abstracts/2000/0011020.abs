  The geometrical (superembedding) approach is used as a tool for deriving from
the worldvolume dynamics of superbranes field theoretical models exhibiting
partial supersymmetry breaking. In this way we obtain nonlinear actions for
Goldstone superfields associated with physical degrees of freedom of the
superbranes.
