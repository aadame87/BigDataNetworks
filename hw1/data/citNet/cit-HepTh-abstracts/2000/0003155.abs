  We investigate the electromagnetic duality properties of an abelian gauge
theory on a compact oriented four-manifold by analysing the behaviour of a
generalised partition function under modular transformations of the
dimensionless coupling constants. The true partition function is invariant
under the full modular group but the generalised partition function exhibits
more complicated behaviour depending on topological properties of the
four-manifold concerned. It is already known that there may be "modular
weights" which are linear combinations of the Euler number and Hirzebruch
signature of the four-manifold. But sometimes the partition function transforms
only under a subgroup of the modular group (the Hecke subgroup). In this case
it is impossible to define real spinor wave functions on the four-manifold. But
complex spinors are possible provided the background magnetic fluxes are
appropriately fractional rather that integral. This gives rise to a second
partition function which enables the full modular group to be realised by
permuting the two partition functions, together with a third. Thus the full
modular group is realised in all cases. The demonstration makes use of various
constructions concerning integral lattices and theta functions that seem to be
of intrinsic interest.
