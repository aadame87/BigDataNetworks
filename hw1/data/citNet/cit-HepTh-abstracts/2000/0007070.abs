  We calculate the NS-R fermionic zero-norm states of type II string spectrum.
The massless and some possible massive zero-norm states are identified to be
responsible for the space-time supersymmetry. The existence of other fermionic
massive zero-norm states with higher spinor-tensor indices correspond to new
enlarged boson-fermion symmetries of the theory at high energy. We also discuss
the R-R charges and R-R zero-norm states and justify that perturbative string
does not carry the massless R-R charges. However, the existence of some massive
R-R zero-norm states make us speculate that string may carry some massive R-R
charges.
