  Several distinct mechanisms of confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking
(DSB) are identified, in a class of supersymmetric $SU(n_c)$, $USp(2n_c)$ and
$SO(n_c)$ gauge theories. In some of the vacua, the magnetic monopoles carrying
nontrivial flavor quantum numbers condense, causing confinement and symmetry
breaking simultaneously. In more general classes of vacua, however, the
effective low-energy degrees of freedom are found to be constituents of the
monopoles - dual (magnetic) quarks. These magnetic quarks condense and give
rise to confinement and DSB. We find two more important classes of vacua, one
is in various universality classes of nontrivial superconformal theories
(SCFT), another in free-magnetic phase.
