  We review the enveloping algebra of the 10 dimensional chiral sigma matrices.
To facilitate the computation of the product of several chiral sigma matrices
we have developed a symbolic program. Using this program one can reduce the
multiplication of the sigma matrices down to linear combinations of irreducilbe
elements. We are able to quickly derive several identities that are not
restricted to traces. A copy of the program written in the Mathematica language
is provided for the community.
