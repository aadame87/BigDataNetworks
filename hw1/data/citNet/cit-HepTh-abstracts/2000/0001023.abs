Title: The String Uncertainty Relations follow from the New Relativity
  Principle
Author: Carlos Castro
Comments: Revised Tex file. 5 pages. Important change of notation for the
  polymomenta coordinates has been made instead of using misleading wedge
  products. The Cosmological constant term is included

  The String Uncertainty Relations have been known for some time as the stringy
corrections to the original Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle. In this letter
the Stringy Uncertainty relations, and corrections thereof, are explicitly
derived from the New Relativity Principle that treats all dimensions and
signatures on the same footing and which is based on the postulate that the
Planck scale is the minimal length in Nature in the same vein that the speed of
light was taken as the maximum velocity in Einstein's theory of Special
Relativity. The Regge behaviour of the string's spectrum is also a natural
consequence of this New Relativity Principle.
