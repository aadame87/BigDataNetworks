  Recently, developments in the understanding of low-energy N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theory have revealed two important phenomena: the appearance of new
four-dimensional superconformal field theories and a non-Abelian generalization
of electric-magnetic duality at the IR fixed point. This report is a
pedagogical introduction to these phenomena. After presenting some necessary
background material, a detailed introduction to the low-energy non-perturbative
dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ QCD is given. The emergence of new
four-dimensional superconformal field theories and non-Abelian duality is
explained. New non-perturbative phenomena in supersymmetric $SO(N_c)$ and
$Sp(N_c=2n_c)$ gauge theories, such as the two inequivalent branches, oblique
confinement and electric-magnetic-dyonic triality, are presented. Finally, some
new features of these four-dimensional superconformal field theories are
exhibited: the universal operator product expansion, evidence for a possible
$c$-theorem in four dimensions and the critical behaviour of anomalous
currents. The concluding remarks contain a brief history of electric-magnetic
duality and a discussion on the possible applications of duality to ordinary
QCD.
