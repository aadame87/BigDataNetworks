  Wigner's method of induced representations is applied to the N=1
super-Poincare group, and by using a state corresponding to the basic vector of
the little group as a Clifford vacuum we show that the spin operator of a
supersymmetric point particle obeys Wigner's constraints. As dynamical
variables for the particle we use canonical coordinates on the symmetry group
manifold. The physical phase space is then constructed using a vielbein
formalism. We find that the Casalbuoni-Brink-Schwarz superparticle appears as a
special case of our general construction. Finally, the theory is reformulated
as a gauge theory where the gauge freedom corresponds to the choice of spin
constraints or, equivalently, the free choice of relativistic center of mass.
In a special case the gauge symmetry reduces to the well known kappa-symmetry.
