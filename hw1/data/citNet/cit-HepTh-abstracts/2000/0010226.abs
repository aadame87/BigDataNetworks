Title: The Renormalization of the Non-Abelian Gauge Theories in the Causal
  Approach
Authors: Dan Radu Grigore
Comments: 29 pages, LATEX 2e, essentially rewritten paper

  We consider the gauge invariance of the standard Yang-Mills model in the
framework of the causal approach of Epstein-Glaser and Scharf and determine the
generic form of the anomalies. The method used is based Epstein-Glaser approach
to renormalization theory. In the case of quantum electrodynamics we obtain
quite easily the absence of anomalies in all orders.
