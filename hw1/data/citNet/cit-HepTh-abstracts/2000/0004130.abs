  We construct regular and black hole solutions in SU(2) Einstein-Born-Infeld
theory. These solutions have many features in common with the corresponding
SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills solutions. In particular, sequences of neutral
non-abelian solutions tend to magnetically charged limiting solutions, related
to embedded abelian solutions. Thermodynamic properties of the black hole
solutions are addressed.
