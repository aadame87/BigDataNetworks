  In supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics with N_c-colors and N_f-flavors of
quarks, our effective superpotential provides the alternative description to
the Seiberg's N=1 duality at least for N_f>=N_c+2, where spontaneous breakdown
of chiral symmetries leads to SU(N_c)_{L+R}xSU(N_f-N_c)_LXSU(N_f-N_c)_R as a
nonabelian chiral symmetry. The anomaly-matching is ensured by the presence of
Nambu-Goldstone superfields associated with this breaking and the instanton
contributions are properly equipped in the effective superpotential.
