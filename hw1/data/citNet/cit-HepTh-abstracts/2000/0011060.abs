  Boundary states for D-branes at orbifold fixed points are constructed in
close analogy with Cardy's derivation of consistent boundary states in RCFT.
Comments are made on the interpretation of the various coefficients in the
explicit expressions, and the relation between fractional branes and wrapped
branes is investigated for $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$ orbifolds. The boundary states
are generalised to theories with discrete torsion and a new check is performed
on the relation between discrete torsion phases and projective representations.
