  As shown by Hashimoto and Itzhaki in hep-th/9911057, the perturbative degrees
of freedom of a non-commutative Yang-Mills theory (NCYM) on a torus are
quasi-local only in a finite energy range. Outside that range one may resort to
a Morita equivalent (or T-dual) description appropriate for that energy. In
this note, we study NCYM on a non-commutative torus with an irrational
deformation parameter $\theta$. In that case, an infinite tower of dual
descriptions is generically needed in order to describe the UV regime. We
construct a hierarchy of dual descriptions in terms of the continued fraction
approximations of $\theta$. We encounter different descriptions depending on
the level of the irrationality of $\theta$ and the amount of non-locality
tolerated. The behavior turns out to be isomorphic to that found for the phase
structure of the four-dimensional Villain $Z_N$ lattice gauge theories, which
we revisit as a warm-up. At large 't Hooft coupling, using the AdS/CFT
correspondance, we find that there are domains of the radial coordinate $U$
where no T-dual description makes the derivative expansion converge. The radial
direction obtains multifractal characteristics near the boundary of AdS.
