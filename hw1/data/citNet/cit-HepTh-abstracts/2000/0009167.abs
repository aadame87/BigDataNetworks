  We present five dimensional gauged supergravity with universal hypermultiplet
on M_4 \times S^1 / Z_2 coupled supersymmetrically to three-branes located at
the fixed points. The construction is extended to the smooth picture with
auxiliary singlet and four-form fields. The model admits the Randall-Sundrum
solution as a BPS vacuum with vanishing energy. We give the form of all
KK-tower modes for fields present in the model.
