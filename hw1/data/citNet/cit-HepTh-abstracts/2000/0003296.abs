Title: Modal field theory and quasi-sparse eigenvector diagonalization
Authors: Dean Lee (UMass Amherst)
Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, uses ws-p8-50x6-00.cls (included in tar file), to
  appear in the proceedings of the Workshop on Light-Cone QCD and
  Nonperturbative Hadron Physics, Adelaide, December 1999
\\
  We review recent developments in non-perturbative field theory using modal
field methods. We discuss Monte Carlo results as well as a new diagonalization
technique known as the quasi-sparse eigenvector method.
