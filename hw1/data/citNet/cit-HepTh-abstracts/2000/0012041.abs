  We consider a class of special Lagrangian subspaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds
and identify their mirrors, using the recent derivation of mirror symmetry, as
certain holomorphic varieties of the mirror geometry. This transforms the
counting of holomorphic disc instantons ending on the Lagrangian submanifold to
the classical Abel-Jacobi map on the mirror. We recover some results already
anticipated as well as obtain some highly non-trivial new predictions.
