  We address the problem of computing scattering amplitudes related to the
correlation function of two Wilson lines and/or loops elongated along
light-cone directions in strongly coupled gauge theories. Using the AdS/CFT
correspondence in the classical approximation, the amplitudes are shown to be
related to minimal surfaces generalizing the {\em helicoid} in various $AdS_5$
backgrounds. Infra-red divergences appearing for Wilson lines can be factorized
out or can be cured by considering the IR finite case of correlation functions
of two Wilson loops. In non-conformal cases related to confining theories,
reggeized amplitudes with linear trajectories and unit intercept are obtained
and shown to come from the approximately flat metrics near the horizon, which
sets the scale for the Regge slope. In the conformal case the absence of
confinement leads to a different solution. A transition between both regimes
appears, in a confining theory, when varying impact parameter.
