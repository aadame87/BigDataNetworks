Title: Conformal Field Theory Correlators From sine-Gordon Model on AdS
  Spacetime
Authors: Sze-Shiang Feng and Mu-Lin Yan
Comments: Latex, 8 pages, no figures
\\
  Using the proposed AdS/CFT correspondence, we calculate the correlators of
operators of conformal field theory at the boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$
corresponding to the sine-Gordon model in the bulk.
