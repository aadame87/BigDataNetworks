  The possibility that a static magnetic field may decay through production of
electron positron pairs is studied. The conclusion is that this decay cannot
happen through production of single pairs, as in the electric case, but only
through the production of a many-body state, since the mutual magnetic
interactions of the created pairs play a relevant role. The investigation is
made in view of the proposed existence of huge magnetic field strengths around
some kind of neutron stars.
