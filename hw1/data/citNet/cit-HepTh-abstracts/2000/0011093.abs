  These lectures are devoted to the low energy limit of \N2 SUSY gauge
theories, which is described in terms of integrable systems. A special emphasis
is on a duality that naturally acts on these integrable systems. The duality
turns out to be an effective tool in constructing the double elliptic
integrable system which describes the six-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory. At
the same time, it implies a series of relations between other Seiberg-Witten
systems.
