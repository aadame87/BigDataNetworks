  We study the presence of symmetry transformations in the Faddeev-Jackiw
approach for constrained systems. Our analysis is based in the case of a
particle submitted to a particular potential which depends on an arbitrary
function. The method is implemented in a natural way and symmetry generators
are identified. These symmetries permit us to obtain the absent elements of the
sympletic matrix which complement the set of Dirac brackets of such a theory.
The study developed here is applied in two different dual models. First, we
discuss the case of a two-dimensional oscillator interacting with an
electromagnetic potential described by a Chern-Simons term and second the
Schwarz-Sen gauge theory, in order to obtain the complete set of non-null Dirac
brackets and the correspondent Maxwell electromagnetic theory limit.
