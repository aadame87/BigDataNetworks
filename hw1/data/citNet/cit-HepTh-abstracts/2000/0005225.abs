  This report provides a pedagogical introduction to the description of the
general Poincare supergravity/matter/Yang-Mills couplings using methods of
Kahler superspace geometry. At a more advanced level this approach is
generalized to include tensor field and Chern-Simons couplings in supersymmetry
and supergravity, relevant in the context of weakly and strongly coupled string
theories.
