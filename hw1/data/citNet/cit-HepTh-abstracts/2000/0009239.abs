  The quantization of the Brink-Schwarz-Casalbuoni superparticle is performed
in an explicitly covariant way using the antibracket formalism. Since an
infinite number of ghost fields are required, within a suitable off-shell
twistor-like formalism, we are able to fix the gauge of each ghost sector
without modifying the physical content of the theory. The computation reveals
that the antibracket cohomology contains only the physical degrees of freedom.
