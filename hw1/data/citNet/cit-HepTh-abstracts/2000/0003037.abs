  We explain how D-branes on group manifolds are stabilized against shrinking
by quantized worldvolume U(1) fluxes. Starting from the Born-Infeld action in
the case of the SU(2) group manifold we derive the masses, multiplicities and
spectrum of small fluctuations of these branes, and show that they agree
exactly with the predictions of conformal field theory, to all orders in the
$\alpha^\prime$ expansion. We discuss the generalization to other groups and
comment on an apparent paradox: why are the `RR charges' of these branes not
quantized?
