  We examine the evaporation of a small black hole on a brane in a world with
large extra dimensions. Since the masses of many Kaluza-Klein modes are much
smaller than the Hawking temperature of the black hole, it has been claimed
that most of the energy is radiated into these modes. We show that this is
incorrect. Most of the energy goes into the modes on the brane. This raises the
possibility of observing Hawking radiation in future high energy colliders if
there are large extra dimensions.
