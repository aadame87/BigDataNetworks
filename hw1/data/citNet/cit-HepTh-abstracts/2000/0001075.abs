Title: The RP^2 Valued Sigma and Baby Skyrme Models
Authors: Matthew D. E. Szyndel
Comments: LaTeX 2e, 22 pages including 11 figures
Report-no: DTP/00/3
\\
  We investigate the sigma and baby Skyrme models with an RP^2 target space. We
compare these models to models with an S^2 target space. We investigate the
interactions between solitons and defects in the RP^2 sigma model.
