  The quantum-mechanical D-dimensional inverse square potential is analyzed
using field-theoretic renormalization techniques. A solution is presented for
both the bound-state and scattering sectors of the theory using cutoff and
dimensional regularization. In the renormalized version of the theory, there is
a strong-coupling regime where quantum-mechanical breaking of scale symmetry
takes place through dimensional transmutation, with the creation of a single
bound state and of an energy-dependent s-wave scattering matrix element.
