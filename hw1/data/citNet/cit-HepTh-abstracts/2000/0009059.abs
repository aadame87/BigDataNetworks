  d5 dilatonic gravity action with surface counterterms motivated by AdS/CFT
correspondence and with contributions of brane quantum CFTs is considered
around AdS-like bulk. The effective equations of motion are constructed. They
admit two (outer and inner) or multi-brane solutions where brane CFTs may be
different. The role of quantum brane CFT is in inducing of complicated brane
dilatonic gravity. For exponential bulk potentials the number of AdS-like bulk
spaces is found in analytical form.The correspondent flat or curved (de Sitter
or hyperbolic) dilatonic two branes are created, as a rule, thanks to quantum
effects. The observable early Universe may correspond to inflationary brane.
The found dilatonic quantum two brane-worlds usually contain the naked
singularity but in couple explicit examples the curvature is finite and horizon
(corresponding to wormhole-like space) appears.
