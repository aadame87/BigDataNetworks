  The role of bulk matter quantum effects (via the corresponding effective
potential discussed on the example of conformal scalar) and of boundary matter
quantum effects (via the conformal anomaly induced effective action) is
considered in brane-world cosmology. Scenario is used where brane tension is
not free parameter, and the initial bulk-brane classical action is defined by
some considerations. The effective bulk-brane equations of motion are analyzed.
The quantum creation of 4d de Sitter or Anti-de Sitter(AdS) brane Universe
living in 5d AdS space is possible when quantum bulk and (or) brane matter is
taken into account. The consideration of only conformal field theory (CFT)
living on the brane admits the full analytical treatment. Then bulk
gravitational Casimir effect leads to deformation of 5d AdS space shape as well
as of shape of spherical or hyperbolic branes. The generalization of above
picture for the dominant bulk quantum gravity naturally represents such
scenario as self-consistent warped compactification within AdS/CFT set-up.
