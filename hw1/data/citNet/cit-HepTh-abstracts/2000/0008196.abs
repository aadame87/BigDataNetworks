  The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first purpose is to review a
systematic construction of Noether currents for supersymmetric theories,
especially effective supersymmetric theories. The second purpose is to use
these currents to derive the mass-formula for the quantized Seiberg-Witten
model from the supersymmetric algebra. We check that the mass-formula of the
low-energy theory agrees with that of the full theory (in the broken phase).
