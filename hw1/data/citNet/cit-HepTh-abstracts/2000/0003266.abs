  Shape Invariant potentials in the sense of [Gendenshte\"{\i}n L.\'E., JETP
Lett. 38, (1983) 356] which depend on more than two parameters are not know to
date. In [Cooper F., Ginocchio J.N. and Khare A., Phys. Rev. {\bf 36 D}, (1987)
2458] was posed the problem of finding a class of Shape Invariant potentials
which depend on n parameters transformed by translation, but it was not solved.
We analyze the problem using some properties of the Riccati equation and we
find the general solution.
