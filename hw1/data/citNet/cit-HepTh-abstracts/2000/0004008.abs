  It is shown that next-nearest-neighbor interactions may lead to unusual
paramagnetic or ferromagnetic phases which physical content is radically
different from the standard phases. Actually there are several particles
described by the same quantum field in a manner similar to the species doubling
of the lattice fermions. We prove the renormalizability of the theory at the
one loop level.
