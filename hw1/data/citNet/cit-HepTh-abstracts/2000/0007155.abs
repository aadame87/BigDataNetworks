  Starting from the Moyal formulation of M-theory in the large N-limit, we
propose to reexamine the associated membrane equations of motion in 10
dimensions formulated in terms of Poisson bracket. Among the results obtained,
we rewrite the coupled first order Nahm's equations into a simple form leading
in turn to their systematic relation with $SU(\infty)$ Yang Mills equations of
motion. The former are interpreted as the vanishing condition of some conserved
currents which we propose. We develop also an algebraic analysis in which an
ansatz is considered and find an explicit form for the membrane solution of our
problem. Typical solutions known in literature can also emerge as special cases
of the proposed solution
