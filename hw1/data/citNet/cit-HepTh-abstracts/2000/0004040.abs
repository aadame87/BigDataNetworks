  We study the quark-antiquark interaction in the large N limit of the
superconformal field theory on D-3branes at a Calabi-Yau conical singularity.
We compute the Wilson loop in the AdS_5xT^{11} supergravity background for the
SU(2N)x SU(2N) theory. We also calculate the Wilson loop for the Higgs phase
where the gauge group is broken to SU(N)x SU(N)x SU_D(N). This corresponds to a
two center configuration with some of the branes at the singularity and the
rest of them at a smooth point. The calculation exhibits the expected Coulomb
dependence for the interaction. The angular distribution of the BPS states is
different than the one for a spherical horizon.
