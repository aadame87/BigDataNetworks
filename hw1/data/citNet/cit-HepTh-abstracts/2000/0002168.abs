  Link invariants, for 3-manifolds, are defined in the context of the
Rozansky-Witten theory. To each knot in the link one associates a holomorphic
bundle over a holomorphic symplectic manifold X. The invariants are evaluated
for b_{1}(M) \geq 1 and X Hyper-Kaehler. To obtain invariants of Hyper-Kaehler
X one finds that the holomorphic vector bundles must be hyper-holomorphic. This
condition is derived and explained. Some results for X not Hyper-Kaehler are
presented.
