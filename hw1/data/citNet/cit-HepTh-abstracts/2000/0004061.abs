  We discuss the non-linear sigma model representing a NSR open string in a
curved background with non-zero $B_{\mu\nu}$-field. With this coupling the
theory is not automatically supersymmetric, due to boundary contributions. When
B=0 supersymmetry is ensured by the conditions that follow as the boundary
contribution to the field equations. We show that inclusion of a particular
boundary term restores this state of affairs also in the presence of a
$B$-field. The boundary conditions derived from the field equations in this
case agree with those that have been proposed for constant $B$-field. A
coupling to a boundary $A_\mu$-field will modify both the boundary conditions
and affect the supersymmetry. It is shown that there is an $A$-coupling with
non-standard fermionic part that respects both the supersymmetry and the shift
symmetry (in the $B$ and $A$ fields), modulo the (modified) boundary
conditions.
