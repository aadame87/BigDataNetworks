  We propose a universal expression for the moduli metric of a class of four-
and five-dimensional black holes which preserve at least four supersymmetries.
These include the black holes that are associated with various intersecting
branes in ten and eleven dimensions, the electrically charged black holes of
N=2 D=5 and N=2 D=4 supergravities with any number of vector multiplets, and
dyonic black holes of N=2 D=4 supergravity. The moduli metric of electrically
charged N=2 D=4 black holes coupled to any number of vector multiplets is
explicitly computed. We also investigate the superconformal symmetries of the
black hole moduli spaces for small black hole separations.
