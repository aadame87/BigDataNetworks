  It is a general belief that the only possible way to consistently deform the
Pauli-Fierz action, changing also the gauge algebra, is general relativity.
Here we show that a different type of deformation exists in three dimensions if
one allows for PT non-invariant terms. The new gauge algebra is different from
that of diffeomorphisms. Furthermore, this deformation can be generalized to
the case of a collection of massless spin-two fields. In this case it describes
a consistent interaction among them.
