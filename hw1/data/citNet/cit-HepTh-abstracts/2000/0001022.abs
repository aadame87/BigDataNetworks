  We take advantage of the superspace formalism and explicitly find the N=2
supersymmetric extension of the Maxwell Chern-Simons model. In our construction
a special form of a potential term and indispensability of an additional
neutral scalar field arise naturally. By considering the algebra of
supersymmetric charges we find Bogomol'nyi equations for the investigated
model.
