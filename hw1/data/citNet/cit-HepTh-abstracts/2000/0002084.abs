  We investigate some aspects of Moyal-Weyl deformations of superspace and
their compatibility with supersymmetry. For the simplest case, when only
bosonic coordinates are deformed, we consider a four dimensional supersymmetric
field theory which is the deformation of the Wess-Zumino renormalizable theory
of a chiral superfield. We then consider the deformation of a free theory of an
abelian vector multiplet, which is a non commutative version of the rank one
Yang-Mills theory. We finally give the supersymmetric version of the
$\alpha'\mapsto 0$ limit of the Born-Infeld action with a B-field turned on,
which is believed to be related to the non commutative U(1) gauge theory.
