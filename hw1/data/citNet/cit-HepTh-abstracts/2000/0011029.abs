Title: Matrix Model and String Field Theory
Authors: J. Kluson
Comments: 23 pages, Revised paper, new proofs of the properties of BRST
  operator included, relation with cubic string field theory discussed,
  reference added
\\
  In this short note we would like to show the relation between the cubic
string field theory for N D-instantons and the string field theory in the
presence of the background B field.
