  In the extended antifield formalism, a quantum BRST differential for
anomalous gauge theories is constructed. Local BRST cohomological classes are
characterized, besides the form degree and the ghost number, by the length of
their descents and of their lifts, and this both in the standard and the
extended antifield formalism. It is shown that during the BRST invariant
renormalization of a local BRST cohomological class, the anomaly that can
appear is constrained to be a local BRST cohomological class with a shorter
descent and a longer lift than the given class. As an application of both
results, a simple approach to the Adler-Bardeen theorem for the non abelian
gauge anomaly is proposed. It applies independently of the gauge fixing, of
power counting restrictions and does not rely on the use of the Callan-Symanzik
equation.
