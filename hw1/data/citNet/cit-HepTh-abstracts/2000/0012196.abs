Title: Field spectrum and degrees of freedom in AdS/CFT correspondence and
  Randall Sundrum model
Authors: Henrique Boschi-Filho and Nelson R. F. Braga
Comments: We included a new section comparing the physical settings of the
  present article with those from D-brane formulation of black p-branes. We
  also added related references. Version to be published in Nucl. Phys. B

  Compactified AdS space can not be mapped into just one Poincare coordinate
chart. This implies that the bulk field spectrum is discrete despite the
infinite range of the coordinates. We discuss here why this discretization of
the field spectrum seems to be a necessary ingredient for the holographic
mapping. For the Randall Sundrum model we show that this discretization appears
even without the second brane.
