  We present a new and asymmetric N=4 superconformal algebra for arbitrary
central charge, thus completing our recent work on its classical analogue with
vanishing central charge. Besides the Virasoro generator and 4 supercurrents,
the algebra consists of an internal SL(2) \otimes U(1) Kac-Moody algebra in
addition to two spin 1/2 fermions and a bosonic scalar. The algebra is shown to
be invariant under a linear twist of the generators, except for a unique value
of the continuous twist parameter. At this value, the invariance is broken and
the algebra collapses to the small N=4 superconformal algebra. In the context
of string theory, the asymmetric N=4 superconformal algebra is provided with an
explicit construction on the boundary of AdS_3, and is induced by an affine
SL(2|2) current superalgebra residing on the world sheet. Substituting the
world sheet SL(2|2) by the coset SL(2|2)/U(1) results in the small N=4
superconformal algebra on the boundary of AdS_3.
