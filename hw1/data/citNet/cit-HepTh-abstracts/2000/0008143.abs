  We apply negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) to three outstanding
gauges: Feynman, light-cone and Coulomb gauges. Our aim is to show that NDIM is
a very suitable technique to deal with loop integrals, being them originated
from any gauge choice. In Feynman gauge we perform scalar two-loop four-point
massless integrals; in the light-cone gauge we calculate scalar two-loop
integrals contributing for two-point functions without any kind of
prescriptions, since NDIM can abandon such devices -- this calculation is the
first test of our prescriptionless method beyond one-loop order; finally, for
the Coulomb gauge we consider a four propagator massless loop integral, in the
split dimensional regularization context.
