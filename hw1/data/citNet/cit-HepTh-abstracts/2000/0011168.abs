  We study disk amplitudes whose boundaries have heterogeneous matter states in
a system of $(4,5)$ conformal matter coupled to 2-dim gravity. They are
analysed by using the 3-matrix chain model in the large $N$ limit. Each of the
boundaries is composed of two or three parts with distinct matter states. From
the obtained amplitudes, it turns out that each heterogeneous boundary loop
splits into several loops and we can observe properties in the splitting
phenomena that are common to each of them. We also discuss the relation to
boundary operators.
