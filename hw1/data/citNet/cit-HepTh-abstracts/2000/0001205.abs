  We point out that the low energy theory of 6d, N=(2,0) field theories, when
away from the origin of the moduli space of vacua, necessarily includes a new
kind of Wess-Zumino term. The form of this term is related to the Hopf
invariant associated with \pi_7 (S^4). The coefficient of the Wess-Zumino term
is fixed by an anomaly matching relation for a global flavor symmetry. For
example, in the context of a single M5 brane probe in the background of N
distant M5 branes, the probe must have the Hopf-WZ term with coefficient
proportional to N(N+1). Various related checks and observations are made. We
also point out that there are skyrmionic strings, and propose that they are the
W-boson strings.
