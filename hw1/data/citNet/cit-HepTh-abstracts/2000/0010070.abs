Title: Comment on "First Order Transition in the Ginzburg-Landau Model"
Authors: H. Fort
Comments: 2 pages, 2 postscript (eps) figures

  I present clear evidences that for $d$=2 a first order transition takes place
when the coherence length $\xi$ becomes of the order of the lattice spacing and
that this is connected with a sudden proliferation of vortices. Similar results
where reported in cond-mat/0010119 although using a different parametrization
of the G-L model which obscures the comparison with recent results obtained by
means of a variational approximation.
