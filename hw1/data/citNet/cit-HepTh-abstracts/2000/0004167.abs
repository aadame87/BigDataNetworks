  We search for an abelian description of the Yang-Mills instantons on certain
eight dimensional manifolds with the special holonomies $Spin(7)$ and SU(4). By
mimicing the Seiberg-Witten theory in four dimensions, we propose a set of
monopole-like equations governing the 8-dimensional U(1) connections and
spinors, which are supposed to be the dual theory of the nonabelian instantons.
We also give a naive test of the generalized $S$-duality in the abelian sector
of 8-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. Some problems in this approach are pointed
out.
