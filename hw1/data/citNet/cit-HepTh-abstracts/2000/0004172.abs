  We consider bosonic noncritical strings as QCD strings and we present a basic
strategy to construct them in the context of Liouville theory. We show that
Dirichlet boundary conditions play important roles in generalized Liouville
theory. Specifically, they are used to stabilize the classical configuration of
strings and also utilized to treat tachyon condensation in our model. We point
out that Dirichlet boundary conditions for the Liouville mode maintains Weyl
invariance, if an appropriate condition is satisfied, in the background with a
(non-linear) dilaton.
