  By exploiting the boundary state formalism we obtain the string correlator
between two internal points on the one loop open string world-sheet in the
presence of a constant background $B$-field. From this derivation it is clear
that there is an ambiguity when one tries to restrict the Green function to the
boundary of the surface. We fix this ambiguity by showing that there is a {\em
unique} form for the correlator between two points on the boundary which
reproduces the one loop field theory results of different noncommutative field
theories. In particular, we present the derivation of one loop diagrams for
$\phi^3_6$ and $\phi^4_4$ scalar interactions and for Yang--Mills theory. From
the 2-point function we are able to derive the one loop $\beta$-function for
noncommutative gauge theory.
