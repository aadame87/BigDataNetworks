  Tachyon condensation on a bosonic D-brane was recently demonstrated
numerically in Witten's open string field theory with level truncation
approximation. This non-perturbative vacuum, which is obtained by solving the
equation of motion, has to satisfy furthermore the requirement of BRST
invariance. This is indispensable in order for the theory around the
non-perturbative vacuum to be consistent. We carry out the numerical analysis
of the BRST invariance of the solution and find that it holds to a good
accuracy. We also mention the zero-norm property of the solution. The
observations in this paper are expected to give clues to the analytic
expression of the vacuum solution.
