  These lecture notes give a pedagogical and (mostly) self-contained review of
some basic aspects of the Matrix model of M-theory. The derivations of the
model as a regularized supermembrane theory and as the discrete light-cone
quantization of M-theory are presented. The construction of M-theory objects
from matrices is described, and gravitational interactions between these
objects are derived using Yang-Mills perturbation theory. Generalizations of
the model to compact and curved space-times are discussed, and the current
status of the theory is reviewed.
