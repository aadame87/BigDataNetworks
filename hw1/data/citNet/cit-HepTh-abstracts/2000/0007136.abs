  D4 N=1 SYM with an arbitrary chiral background superfield as the gauge
coupling is considered. The solution to Slavnov-Taylor identities has been
given. It has been shown that the solution is unique and allows us to restrict
the gauge part of the effective action. Under the effective action in this
paper we mean the 1PI diagram generator.
