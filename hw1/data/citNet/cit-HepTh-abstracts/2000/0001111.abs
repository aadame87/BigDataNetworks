  Recently Seiberg and Witten have proposed that noncommutative gauge theories
realized as effective theories on D-brane are equivalent to some ordinary gauge
theories. This proposal has been proved, however, only for the
Dirac-Born-Infeld action in the approximation of neglecting all derivative
terms. In this paper we explicitly construct general forms of the 2n-derivative
terms which satisfy this equivalence under their assumption in the
approximation of neglecting (2 n+2)-derivative terms. We also prove that the
D-brane action computed in the superstring theory is consistent with the
equivalence neglecting the fourth and higher order derivative terms.
