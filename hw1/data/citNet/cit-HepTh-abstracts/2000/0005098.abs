  We construct two families of globally supersymmetric counterparts of standard
Poincar\'e supersymmetric SYM theories on curved space-times admitting Killing
spinors, in all dimensions less than six and eight respectively. The former
differs from the standard theory only by mass terms for the fermions and
scalars and modified supersymmetry transformation rules, the latter in addition
has cubic Chern-Simons like couplings for the scalar fields. We partially
calculate the supersymmetry algebra of these models, finding R-symmetry
extensions proportional to the curvature. We also show that generically these
theories have no continuous Coulomb branch of maximally supersymmetric vacua,
but that there exists a half-BPS Coulomb branch approaching the standard
Coulomb branch in the Ricciflat limit.
