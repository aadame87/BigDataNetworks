  Liouville integrability of classical Calogero-Moser models is proved for
models based on any root systems, including the non-crystallographic ones. It
applies to all types of elliptic potentials, i.e. untwisted and twisted
together with their degenerations (hyperbolic, trigonometric and rational),
except for the rational potential models confined by a harmonic force.
