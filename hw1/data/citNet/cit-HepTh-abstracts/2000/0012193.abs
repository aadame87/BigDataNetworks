  We study the world volume action of fractional Dp-branes of type IIA string
theory compactified on the orbifold T^4/Z_2. The geometric relation between
these branes and wrapped branes is investigated using conformal techniques. In
particular we examine in detail various scattering amplitudes and find that the
leading low-energy interactions are consistent with the boundary action derived
geometrically.
