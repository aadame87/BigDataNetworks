Title: Fourth Order Theories Without Ghosts

  Using the Dirac constraint method we show that the pure fourth-order
Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator model is free of observable negative norm states.
Even though such ghosts do appear when the fourth order theory is coupled to a
second order one, the limit in which the second order action is switched off is
found to be a highly singular one in which these states move off shell. Given
this result, construction of a fully unitary, renormalizable, gravitational
theory based on a purely fourth order action in 4 dimensions now appears
feasible.
