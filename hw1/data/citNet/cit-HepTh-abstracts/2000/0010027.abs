  The perturbative dynamics of noncommutative field theory (NCFT) is discussed
from a point view of string field theory. As in the commutative case it is
inevitable to introduce a closed string, which may be described as a bound
state of two noncommutative open strings. We point out that the closed string,
interacting nontrivially with the open string, plays an essential role in the
ultraviolet region. The contribution of the closed string is responsible for
the discrepancy between the NCFT and the string field theory. It clarifies the
controversial issues associated with the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) behaviour
of the perturbative dynamics of the NCFT.
