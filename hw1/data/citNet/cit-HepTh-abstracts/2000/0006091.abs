  We study the generalization of noncommutative gauge theories to the case of
orthogonal and symplectic groups. We find out that this is possible, since we
are allowed to define orthogonal and symplectic subgroups of noncommutative
unitary gauge transformations even though the gauge potentials and gauge
transformations are not valued in the orthogonal and symplectic subalgebras of
the Lie algebra of antihermitean matrices. Our construction relies on an
antiautomorphism of the basic noncommutative algebra of functions which
generalizes the charge conjugation operator of ordinary field theory. We show
that the corresponding noncommutative picture from low energy string theory is
obtained via orientifold projection in the presence of a non-trivial NSNS
B-field.
