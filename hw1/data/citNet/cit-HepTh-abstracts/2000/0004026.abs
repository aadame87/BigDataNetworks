Title: Light-front vacuum and instantons in two dimensions
Authors: A. Bassetto, L. Griguolo and F. Vian
Comments: 16 pages, REVTEX. To appear in the proceedings of the CSSM Workshop
  on Light-Cone QCD and Nonperturbative Hadron Physics, Adelaide, Australia,

Report-no: DFPD 00/TH 20, UPRF-2000-06
\\
  We review several aspects of Yang-Mills theory (YMT) in two dimensions,
related to its perturbative and topological properties. Consistency between
light-front and equal-time formulations is thoroughly discussed.
