  The correlation function of two dimensional Ising model with the nearest
neighbours interaction on the finite size lattice with the periodical boundary
conditions is derived. The expressions similar to the form factor
representation are obtained both for the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions
of coupling constant. The peculiarities caused by the finite size of the system
are discussed. The asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding quantities as
functions of size is calculated. Some generalization of the obtained result is
conjectured.
