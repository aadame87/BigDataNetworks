  We outline the the geometry of locally anisotropic (la) superspaces and
la-supergravity. The approach is backgrounded on the method of anholonomic
superframes with associated nonlinear connection structure. Following the
formalism of enveloping algebras and star product calculus we propose a model
of gauge la-gravity on noncommutative spaces. The corresponding Seiberg-Witten
maps are established which allow the definition of dynamics for a finite number
of gravitational gauge field components on noncommutative spaces.
