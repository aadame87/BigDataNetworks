  We consider the noncommutative Abelian-Higgs theory and construct new types
of exact multi-vortex solutions that solve the static equations of motion. They
in general do not follow from the BPS equations; only for some specific values
of parameters, they satisfy the BPS equations saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound.
We further consider the Abelian-Higgs theory with more complicated scalar
potential allowing unstable minima and construct exact solutions of
noncommutative false vacuum bubble with integer magnetic flux. The classical
stability of the solutions is discussed.
