  We review the boundary state description of D-branes in type I string theory
and show that the only stable non-BPS configurations are the D-particle and the
D-instanton. We also compute the gauge and gravitational interactions of the
non-BPS D-particles and compare them with the interactions of the dual non-BPS
states of the heterotic string, finding complete agreement.
