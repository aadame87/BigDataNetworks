  We propose a geometrized Higgs mechanism based on the gravitational sector in
the Connes-Lott formulation of the standard model, which has been constructed
by Chamseddine, Fr$\ddot{o}$hlic and Grandjean. The point of our idea is that
Higgs-like couplings depend on the local coordinates of the four-dimensional
continuum,$M_4$. The localized couplings can be calculated by the Wilson loops
of the $U(1)_{EM}$ gauge field and the connection, which is defined on
$Z_2\times{M_4}$.
