  One of the important consequences of the no-force condition for BPS states is
the existence of stable static multi-center solutions, at least in ungauged
supergravities. This observation has been at the heart of many developments in
brane physics, including the construction of intersecting branes and reduced
symmetry D-brane configurations corresponding to the Coulomb branch of the
gauge theory. However the search for multi-center solutions to gauged
supergravities has proven rather elusive. Because of the background curvature,
it appears such solutions cannot be static. Nevertheless even allowing for time
dependence, general multi-center solutions to gauged supergravity have yet to
be constructed. In this letter we investigate the construction of such
solutions for the case of D=5, N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary
number of vector multiplets. Formally, we find a family of time dependent
multi-center black hole solutions which are easily generalized to the case of
AdS supergravities in general dimensions. While these are not true solutions,
as they have a complex metric and gauge potential, they may be related to a
Wick rotated theory or to a theory where the coupling is taken to be imaginary.
These solutions thus provide a partial realization of true multi-center
black-holes in gauged supergravities.
