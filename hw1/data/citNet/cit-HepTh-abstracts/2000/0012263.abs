  An introduction to supersymmetric (SUSY) solutions defined on the product of
Ricci-flat spaces in D= 11 supergravity is presented. The paper contains some
background information: (i) decomposition relations for SUSY equations and (ii)
2^{-k}-splitting theorem that explains the appearance of N = 2^{-k} fractional
supersymmetries. Examples of M2 and M5 branes on the product of two Ricci-flat
spaces are considered and formulae for (fractional) numbers of unbroken SUSY
are obtained.
