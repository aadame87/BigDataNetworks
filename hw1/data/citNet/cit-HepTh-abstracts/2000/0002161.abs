  We examine the behaviour of gravity in brane theories with extra dimensions
in a non-factorizable geometry. We find that for metrics which are
asymptotically flat far from the brane there is a resonant graviton mode at
zero energy. The presence of this resonance ensures quasi-localization of
gravity, whereby at intermediate scales the gravitational laws on the brane are
approximately four dimensional. However, for scales larger than the lifetime of
the graviton resonance the five dimensional laws of gravity will be reproduced
due to the decay of the four dimensional graviton. We also present a simple
classification of the possible types of effective gravity theories on the brane
that can appear for general non-factorizable background theories.
