  There exist two versions of the covariant Schwinger term in the literature.
They only differ by a sign. However, we shall show that this is an essential
difference. We shall carefully (taking all signs into account) review the
existing quantum field theoretical computations for the covariant Schwinger
term in order to determine the correct expression.
