  We recall the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop in the
Yang-Mills theory and discuss its meaning. Then we move to `gravitational
Wilson loops', i.e. to holonomies in curved d=2,3,4 spaces and derive
non-Abelian Stokes theorems for these quantities as well, which are similar to
our formula in the Yang-Mills theory. In particular we derive an elegant
formula for the holonomy in the case of a constant-curvature background in
three dimensions and a formula for small-area loops in any number of
dimensions.
