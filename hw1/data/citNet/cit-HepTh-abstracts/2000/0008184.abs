\\
  In this paper we analyze discrete torsion in perturbative heterotic string
theory. In previous work we have given a purely mathematical explanation of
discrete torsion as the choice of orbifold group action on a B field, in the
case that d H = 0; in this paper, we perform the analogous calculations in
heterotic strings where d H is nonzero.
