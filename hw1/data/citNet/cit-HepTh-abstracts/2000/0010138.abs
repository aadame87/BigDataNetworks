  We consider asymtotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes in general dimensions. We
review the origin of infrared divergences in the on-shell gravitational action,
and the construction of the renormalized on-shell action by the addition of
boundary counterterms. In odd dimensions, the renormalized on-shell action is
not invariant under bulk diffeomorphisms that yield conformal transformations
in the boundary (holographic Weyl anomaly). We obtain formulae for the
gravitational stress energy tensor, defined as the metric variation of the
renormalized on-shell action, in terms of coefficients in the asymptotic
expansion of the metric near infinity. The stress energy tensor transforms
anomalously under bulk diffeomorphisms broken by infrared divergences.
