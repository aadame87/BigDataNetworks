Title: Asymptotic Dynamics in Quantum Field Theory - When does the coupling
  switch off?
Authors: Robin Horan, Martin Lavelle and David McMullan
Comments: LaTeX, 10 pages, 3 eps figures

  We discuss the approach to asymptotic dynamics due to Kulish and Faddeev. We
show that there are problems in applying this method to theories with four
point interactions. The source of the difficulties is identified and a more
general method is constructed. This is then applied to various theories
including some where the coupling does switch off at large times and some where
it does not.
