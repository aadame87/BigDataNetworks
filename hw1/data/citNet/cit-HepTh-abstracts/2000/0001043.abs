  In this paper, we put forth a new massive spin-1 field theory. In contrast to
the quantization of traditional vector field, the quantization of the new
vector field is carried out in a natural way. The Lorentz invariance of the
theory is discussed, where owing to an interesting feature of the new vector
field, the Lorentz invariance has a special meaning. In term of formalism
analogical to QED(i. e. spinor QED), we develop the quantum electrodynamics
concerning the new spin-1 particles, say, vector QED, where the Feynman rules
are given. The renormalizability of vector QED is manifest without the aid of
Higgs mechanism. As an example, the polarization cross section $\sigma_{polar}$
for $e^+ e^-\to f^+ f^-$ is calculated in the lowest order. It turns out that
$\sigma_{polar}\sim 0$ and the momentum of $f^+$ and $f^-$ is purely
longitudinal.
