  We study brane-world black holes from Randall-Sundrum(RS) models in
($D+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The solutions are directly
obtained by using a slightly modified RS metric ansatz in $D+1$ dimensions. The
metric of the brane world can be described by the Schwarzschild solution
promoted to the black cigar solution in $D+1$ dimensions, which is compatible
with the recently suggested black cigar solution for D=4. Furthermore, we show
that the Ricci flat condition for the brane can be easily derived from the
effective gravity defined on the brane by using the RS dimensional reduction.
Especially, it is shown that in two dimensions the effective gravity on the
brane is described by the Polyakov action.
