  We consider the one-point functions of bulk and boundary fields in the
scaling Lee-Yang model for various combinations of bulk and boundary
perturbations. The one-point functions of the bulk fields are analysed using
the truncated conformal space approach and the form-factor expansion. Good
agreement is found between the results of the two methods, though we find that
the expression for the general boundary state given by Ghoshal and
Zamolodchikov has to be corrected slightly. For the boundary fields we use
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations to find exact expressions for the strip
and semi-infinite cylinder geometries. We also find a novel off-critical
identity between the cylinder partition functions of models with differing
boundary conditions, and use this to investigate the regions of
boundary-induced instability exhibited by the model on a finite strip.
