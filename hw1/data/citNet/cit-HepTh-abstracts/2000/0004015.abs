Title: Tachyon Condensation on a non-BPS D-brane
Authors: Amer Iqbal, Asad Naqvi
Comments: 17 pages, one figure
Report-no: MIT-CTP-2968
\\
  We extend the recent computation of the tachyon potential by Berkovits, Sen
and Zwiebach by including level two fields and keeping up to level four terms
in the action. We find 90.5% of the expected result.
