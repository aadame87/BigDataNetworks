  The concept of the space (space-time) of the formless finite fundamental
elements (FFFE) is suggested. This space can be defined as a set of coverings
of the continual space by non-overlapping simply connected regions of any form
and arbitrary sizes with some probability measure. The average sizes of each
fundamental element are equal to the fundamental length. This definition
enables to describe correctly the passage from the space of the formless finite
fundamental elements to the continual space in the limit of zero value of the
fundamental length. FFFE space-time functional integral construction is
suggested. A wave function of a separate FFFE and the overall wave function of
a manifold are introduced. It is shown that many other constructions of the
discrete space-time (the Regge coverings, the lattice space-time etc.) are the
special cases of this space-time. A vacuum action problem is analyzed. One term
of this action is proportional to the volume of a fundamental element. It is
possible to direct the way for this term to yield the Nambu-Goto action in
consideration the string as one-dimensional excitation of a number of FFFEs.
Fermionic and bosonic fields in the space-time of FFFEs are excited states of
elements. Space-time supersymmetry leads to supposition that the maximal
possible number of fermionic excitations at one FFFE is equal to the number of
elements in all space-time. The compactification in this space-time means the
condition of the neighbour elements absence in compactificated dimensions.
