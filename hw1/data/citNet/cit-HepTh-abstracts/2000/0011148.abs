  Making use of the N=2 Liouville theory and world-sheet techniques, we study
the properties of D-branes wrapped around vanishing SUSY cycles of singular
Calabi-Yau n-folds (n=2,3,4). After constructing boundary states describing the
wrapped branes, we evaluate the disc amplitudes corresponding to the periods of
SUSY cycles. We use the old technique of KPZ scaling in Liouville theory and
derive holomorphicity and scaling behavior of vanishing cycles which are in
agreement with geometrical considerations.
  We also discuss the open string Witten index using the N=2 Liouville theory
and obtain the intersection numbers among SUSY cycles which also agree with
geometrical expectation.
