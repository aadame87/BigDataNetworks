  The relationship between the classical and quantum theories of gravity is
reexamined. The value of the gravitational potential defined with the help of
the two-particle scattering amplitudes is shown to be in disagreement with the
classical result of General Relativity given by the Schwarzschild solution. It
is shown also that the potential so defined fails to describe whatever
non-Newtonian interactions of macroscopic bodies. An alternative interpretation
of the $\hbar^0$-order part of the loop corrections is given directly in terms
of the effective action. Gauge independence of that part of the one-loop
radiative corrections to the gravitational form factors of the scalar particle
is proved, justifying the interpretation proposed.
