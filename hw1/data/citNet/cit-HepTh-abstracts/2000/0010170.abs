  By exploiting the correspondence between the Cardy boundary state in SU(2)
group manifold and the BPS D3-brane configuration in the full asymptotically
flat geometry of NS5-branes, we show that the Hanany-Witten effect in 10D
background is encoded in the Cardy boundary states. The two RR Page D0 charges
of the $n$-th spherical D2-brane due to the contraction to $e$ or ($-e$) is
interpreted, and attributed to the Hanany-Witten effect.
