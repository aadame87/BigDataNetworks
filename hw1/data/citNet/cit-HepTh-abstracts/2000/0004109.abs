  We show that in brane-world scenarios with warped extra dimensions, the
Casimir force due to bulk matter fields may be sufficient to stabilize the
radion field $\phi$. In particular, we calculate one loop effective potential
for $\phi$ induced by bulk gravitons and other possible massless bulk fields in
the Randall-Sundrum background. This potential has a local extremum, which can
be a maximum or a minimum depending on the detailed bulk matter content. If the
parameters of the background are chosen so that the hierarchy problem is solved
geometrically, then the radion mass induced by Casimir corrections is
hierarchycally smaller than the $TeV$. Hence, in this important case, we must
invoke an alternative mechanism (classical or nonperturbative) which gives the
radion a sizable mass, to make it compatible with observations.
