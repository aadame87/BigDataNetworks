  The proposal that a strong coupling limit of the five-dimensional type II
string theory (M-theory compactified on a 6-torus) in which the Planck length
becomes infinite could give a six-dimensional superconformal phase of M-theory
is reviewed. This limit exists for the free theory, giving a 6-dimensional
theory with (4,0) supersymmetry compactified on a circle whose radius gives the
5-dimensional Planck length. The free 6-dimensional theory has a fourth rank
tensor gauge field with the symmetries of the Riemann tensor instead of a
symmetric tensor gauge field, but its dimensional reduction gives conventional
linearised gravity in five dimensions. The possibility of an interacting form
of this theory existing and the consequences it would have for the geometric
picture of gravity are discussed.
