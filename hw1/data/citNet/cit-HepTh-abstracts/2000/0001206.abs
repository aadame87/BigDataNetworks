  We present Poincare invariant domain wall (``3-brane'') solutions to some
5-dimensional effective theories which can arise naturally in string theory. In
particular, we find theories where Poincare invariant solutions exist for
arbitrary values of the brane tension, for certain restricted forms of the bulk
interactions. We describe examples in string theory where it would be natural
for the quantum corrections to the tension of the brane (arising from quantum
fluctuations of modes with support on the brane) to maintain the required form
of the action. In such cases, the Poincare invariant solutions persist in the
presence of these quantum corrections to the brane tension, so that no 4d
cosmological constant is generated by these modes.
