  As opposed to usual Einstein gravity in four dimensions, the Brane-World
scenario allows the construction of a local density of gravitational energy
(and also of momentum, of angular momentum, etc...). This is a direct
consequence of the hypothesis that our universe is located at the boundary of a
five-dimensional diffeomorphism invariant manifold. We compute these
Brane-World densities of charge using the Lanczos-Israel boundary conditions.
To proceed, we implement an explicitely covariant generalization of the
Hamiltonian procedure of Regge and Teitelboim given in a previous work. We
finally study two simple Brane-World examples.
