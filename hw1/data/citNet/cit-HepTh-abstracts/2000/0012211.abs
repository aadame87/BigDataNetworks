  We obtain the supergravity solution which describes a bound state of
D-string/anti-D-string pairs attached to different fixed planes of an orbifold,
in type IIB string theory compactified on T^4/Z_2. For parameters at which the
conformal field theory point of view predicts stability, the solution displays
a repulson-like singularity. However, we observe that a D-string/anti-D-string
pair probe in this background becomes tensionless before reaching the
singularity, suggesting a resolution by the enhancon mechanism. Moreover, the
force feels by this probe is attractive, in contrast to the repulsive behaviour
observed in the non-BPS D-brane description.
