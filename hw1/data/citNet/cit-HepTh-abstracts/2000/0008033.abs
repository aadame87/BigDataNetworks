  The level truncation approach to string field theory is used to study the
zero-momentum action for vector excitations on a bosonic D-brane which has been
annihilated by tachyon condensation. It is shown that in the true vacuum the
translation zero modes associated with transverse scalars on the D-brane are
lifted by spontaneous generation of mass terms. Similarly, the U(1) gauge field
on the brane develops a nonzero mass term.
