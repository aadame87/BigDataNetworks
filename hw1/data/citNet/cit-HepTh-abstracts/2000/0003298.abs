  In string theory various projections have to be imposed to ensure
supersymmetry. We study the consequences of these projections in the presence
of world sheet boundaries. A-type boundary conditions come in several classes;
only boundary fields that do not change the class preserve supersymmetry. Our
analysis takes in particular properly into account the resolution of fixed
points under the projections. Thus e.g. the compositeness of some previously
considered boundary states of Gepner models follows from chiral properties of
the projections. Our arguments are model independent; in particular,
integrality of all annulus coefficients is ensured by model independent
arguments.
