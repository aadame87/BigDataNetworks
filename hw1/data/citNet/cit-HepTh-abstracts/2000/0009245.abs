  The reflection amplitudes in non-affine Toda theories which possess extended
conformal symmetry are calculated. Considering affine Toda theories as
perturbed non-affine Toda theories and using reflection relations which relate
different fields with the same conformal dimension, we deduce the vacuum
expectation values of local fields for all dual pairs of non-simply laced
affine Toda field theories. As an application, we calculate the leading term in
the short and long distance predictions of the two-point correlation functions
in the massive phase of two coupled minimal models. The central charge of the
unperturbed models ranges from $c=1$ to $c=2$, where the perturbed models
correspond to two magnetically coupled Ising models and Heisenberg spin
ladders, respectively.
