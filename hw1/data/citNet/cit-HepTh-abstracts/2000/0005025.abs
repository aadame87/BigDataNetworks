  We address the question of cosmological perturbations in the context of brane
cosmology, where our Universe is a three-brane where matter is confined,
whereas gravity lives in a higher dimensional spacetime. The equations
governing the bulk perturbations are computed in the case of a general warped
universe. The results are then specialized to the case of a five-dimensional
spacetime, scenario which has recently attracted a lot of attention. In this
context, we decompose the perturbations into `scalar', `vector' and `tensor'
modes, which are familiar in the standard theory of cosmological perturbations.
The junction conditions, which relate the metric perturbations to the matter
perturbations in the brane, are then computed.
