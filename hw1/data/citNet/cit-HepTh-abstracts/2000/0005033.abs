  It has recently been suggested that our universe is a three-brane embedded in
a higher dimensional spacetime. In this paper I examine static, spherically
symmetric solutions that satisfy the effective Einstein field equations on a
brane embedded in a five dimensional spacetime. The field equations involve a
term depending on the five dimensional Weyl tensor, so that the solutions will
not be Schwarzschild in general. This Weyl term is traceless so that any
solution of $^{(4)}R=0$ is a possible four dimensional spacetime. Different
solutions correspond to different five dimensional spacetimes and to different
induced energy-momentum tensors on the brane. One interesting possibility is
that the Weyl term could be responsible for the observed dark matter in the
universe.
