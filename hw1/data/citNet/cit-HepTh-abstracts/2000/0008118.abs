  We analyze the connection between Wess-Zumino-Witten and free fermion models
in two-dimensional noncommutative space. Starting from the computation of the
determinant of the Dirac operator in a gauge field background, we derive the
corresponding bosonization recipe studying, as an example, bosonization of the
U(N) Thirring model. Concerning the properties of the noncommutative
Wess-Zumino-Witten model, we construct an orbit-preserving transformation that
maps the standard commutative WZW action into the noncommutative one.
