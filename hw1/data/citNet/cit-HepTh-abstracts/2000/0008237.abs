  The investigation of boundary breather states of the sinh-Gordon model
restricted to a half-line is revisited. Properties of the classical boundary
breathers for the two-parameter family of integrable boundary conditions are
reviewed and extended. The energy spectrum of the quantized boundary states is
computed, firstly by using a bootstrap technique and, subsequently using a WKB
approximation. Requiring that the two descriptions of the spectrum agree with
one another allows a determination of the relationship between the boundary
parameters, the bulk coupling constant, and the two parameters appearing in the
reflection factor describing the scattering of the sinh-Gordon particle from
the boundary. These calculations had been performed previously for the case in
which the boundary conditions preserve the bulk $Z_2$ symmetry of the model.
The significantly more difficult case of general boundary conditions which
violate the bulk symmetry is treated in this article. The results clarify the
weak-strong coupling duality of the sinh-Gordon model with integrable boundary
conditions.
