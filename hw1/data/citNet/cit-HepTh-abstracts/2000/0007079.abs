  We examine the problem of gauge-field localization in higher-dimensional
gauge theories. In particular, we study a five-dimensional U(1) by lattice
techniques and we find that gauge fields can indeed be localized. Two models
are considered. The first one has anisotropic couplings independent of each
other and of the coordinates. It can be realized on a homogeneous but
anisotropic flat Euclidean space. The second model has couplings depending on
the extra transverse fifth direction. This model can be realized by a U(1)
gauge theory on the Randall-Sundrum background. We find that in both models a
new phase exists, the layer phase, in which a massless photon is localized on
the four-dimensional layers. We find that this phase is separated from the
strong coupling phase by a second order phase transition.
