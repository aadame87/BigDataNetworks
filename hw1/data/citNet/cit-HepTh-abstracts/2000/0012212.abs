  We give in this paper a partial classification of the consistent quadratic
gauge actions that can be written in terms of s-form fields. This provides a
starting point to study the uniqueness of the Yang-Mills action as a
deformation of Maxwell-like theories. We also show that it is impossible to
write kinetic 1-form terms that can be consistently added to other 1-form
actions such as tetrad gravity in four space-time dimensions even in the
presence of a Minkowskian metric background.
