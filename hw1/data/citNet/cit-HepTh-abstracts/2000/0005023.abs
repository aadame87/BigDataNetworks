Title: On the global calculus in local cohomology in BRST theory
Authors: G.Giachetta, L.Mangiarotti and G.Sardanashvily
Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX

  We show that the cohomology groups of the horizontal (total) differential on
horizontal (local) exterior forms on the infinite-order jet manifold of an
affine bundle coincide with the De Rham cohomology groups of the base manifold.
This prevents one from the topological obstruction to the definition of global
descent equations in BRST theory on an arbitrary affine bundle.
