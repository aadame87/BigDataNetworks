  We exploit the tree level bosonic 4-particle scattering amplitudes in D=11
supergravity to construct the bosonic part of a linearized supersymmetry-,
coordinate- and gauge-invariant. By differentiation, this invariant can be
promoted to be the natural lowest (two-loop) order counterterm. Its existence
implies that the perturbative supersymmetry does not protect this ultimate
supergravity from infinities, given also the recently demonstrated divergence
of its 4-graviton amplitude.
