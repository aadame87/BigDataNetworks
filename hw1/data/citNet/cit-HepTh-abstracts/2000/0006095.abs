Authors: Juan Fernando Ospina Giraldo
Comments: 12 pages on Latex
\\
  The Wess-Zumino actions for generalized orientifold planes (GOp-planes) and
y-deformed orientifold planes (yOp-planes) are presented and two series power
expantions are realized from whiches processes that involves
GOp-planes,yOp-planes, RR-forms, gravitons and gaugeons, are obtained. Finally
non-standard GOp-planes and y-Op-planes are showed.
