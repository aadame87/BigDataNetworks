  We generalize the mechanism proposed in [hep-th/0005016] and show that a
four-dimensional relativistic tensor theory of gravitation can be obtained on a
delta-function brane in flat infinite-volume extra space. In particular, we
demonstrate that the induced Ricci scalar gives rise to Einstein's gravity on a
delta-function type brane if the number of space-time dimensions is bigger than
five. The bulk space exhibits the phenomenon of infrared transparency. That is
to say, the bulk can be probed by gravitons with vanishing four-dimensional
momentum square, while it is unaccessible to higher modes. This provides an
attractive framework for solving the cosmological constant problem.
