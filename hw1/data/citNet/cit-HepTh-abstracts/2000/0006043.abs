  We derive an RG flow equation that is satisfied by the regularized partition
function for noncritical strings in background fields. The flow refers to
change in the position of a ``boundary'' in the liouville direction. The
boundary is required to regularize the ultraviolet divergences in the partition
function coming from integration over world-sheets of arbitrarily small area.
  From the point of view of the target space effective gravitational action
that the partition function evaluates on-shell, the boundary regularizes {\it
infrared} divergences coming from the infinite volume of the liouville
direction. The RG flow equation that we obtain looks very much like the
Hamilton-Jacobi constraint equation that an on-shell gauge-fixed gravitational
action must satisfy.
