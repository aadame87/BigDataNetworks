  It has been conjectured that a pair of D5 - anti D5 branes wrapped on some
non-trivial two cycle of a Calabi-Yau manifold becomes a stable BPS D3 brane in
the presence of a very large B field and magnetic fluxes on their worldvolumes.
We discuss this by considering the non-commutative field theory on the
worldvolume of the pair of branes whose field multiplication is made with
respect to two different * products due to the presence of different F fields
on the two branes. The tachyonic field becomes massless for a specific choice
of the magnetic fluxes and it allows a trivial solution. Our discussion
generalizes recent results concerning stability of brane-antibrane systems on
Calabi-Yau spaces to the case of non-commutative branes.
