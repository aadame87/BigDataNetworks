  We discuss the interactions of Goldstone particles with solitonic states. We
observe that, contrary to the familiar situation in the vacuum sector, the
Goldstone particles can have non-derivative interactions with the solitons.
This result is applied to brane physics and in particular leads to the
possibility that neutrinos in brane world scenarios are Goldstone particles for
broken supersymmetry.
