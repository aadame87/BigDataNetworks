Title: Alternative Formulation of The Quantum Electroweak Theory
Authors: Jun-Chen Su
Comments: 17 pages,3 figures
\\
  The quantization of the electroweak theory is performed starting from the
Lagrangian given in the so-called unitary gauge in which the unphysical
Goldstone fields disappear. In such a Lagrangian, the unphysical longitudinal
components of the gauge fields are naturally eliminated by introducing the
Lorentz gauge condition. In this way, the quautum theory given in $\alpha
$-gauge is perfectly established in the Lagangian formalism by the
Faddeev-Popov approach and/or the Lagrange multiplier method in the framework
of SU(2)$\times $U(1) gauge symmetry. The theory established is not only
simpler than the ordinary R$_\alpha -$gauge theory, but also explicitly
renormalizable. The unitarity of the theory is ensured by the limiting
procedure of letting the gauge parameter $\alpha $ appearing in the massive
vector boson propagators tend to infinity in the final step of calculations.
The formulations of the theory with and without involving the Higgs boson are
discussed separately.
