  It is shown that the generator of the nonstandard fermion-monopole
supersymmetry uncovered by De Jonghe, Macfarlane, Peeters and van Holten, and
the generator of its standard N=1/2 supersymmetry have to be supplemented by
their product operator to be treated as independent supercharge. As a result,
the fermion-monopole system possesses the nonlinear N=3/2 supersymmetry having
the nature of the 3D spin-1/2 free particle's supersymmetry generated by the
supercharges represented in a scalar form. Analyzing the supercharges'
structure, we trace how under reduction of the fermion-monopole system to the
spherical geometry the nonlinear N=3/2 superalgebra comprising the Hamiltonian
and the total angular momentum as even generators is transformed into the
standard linear N=1 superalgebra with the Hamiltonian to be the unique even
generator.
