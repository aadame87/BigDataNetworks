  We describe a simple volcano potential, which is supersymmetric and has an
analytic, zero-energy, ground state. (The KK modes are also analytic.) It is an
interior harmonic oscillator potential properly matched to an exterior angular
momentum-like tail. Special cases are given to elucidate the physics, which may
be intuitively useful in studies of higher-dimensional gravity.
