  We show that a generalised reduction of D=10 IIB supergravity leads, in a
certain limit, to a maximally extended SO(2) gauged supergravity in D=9. We
show the scalar potential of this model allows both Minkowski and a new type of
domain wall solution to the Bogomol'nyi equations. We relate these vacua to
type IIB D-branes.
