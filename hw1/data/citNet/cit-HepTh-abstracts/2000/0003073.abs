  Regular and black-hole solutions of the spontaneously broken
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with nonminimal coupling to gravity are shown
to exist. The main characteristics of the solutions are presented and
differences with respect to the minimally coupled case are studied. Since
negative energy densities are found to be possible, traversable wormhole
solutions might exist. We prove that they are absent.
