  We consider the supergravity dual of the N=1* theory at finite temperature by
applying the Polchinski-Strassler construction to the black D3 brane solution
of Type IIB supergravity. At finite temperature the 5-brane probe action is
minimized when the probe falls to the horizon, although metastable minima with
r>>r_H persist for a range of temperatures. Thermal effects on the 3-form
source for the hypermultiplet mass m and its order m^2 back reaction on the
other fields of the IIB theory are computed. We find unique solutions which are
regular at the horizon and have the correct behavior on the boundary. For fixed
temperature T, the horizon shrinks for increasing m^2 suggesting that there is
a critical temperature separating the system into high and low temperature
phases. In the high temperature phase 5-branes are unnecessary since there are
no naked singularities. Using the order m^2 correction to the horizon area we
calculate the correction to the entropy to be \Delta S =-0.1714N^2m^2T, which
is less than the free field result.
