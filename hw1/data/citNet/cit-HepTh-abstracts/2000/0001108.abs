  We study the impact of Aharonov-Bohm solenoid on the radiation of a charged
particle moving in a constant uniform magnetic field. With this aim in view,
exact solutions of Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are found in the
magnetic-solenoid field. Using such solutions, we calculate exactly all the
characteristics of one-photon spontaneous radiation both for spinless and
spinning particle. Considering non-relativistic and relativistic
approximations, we analyze cyclotron and synchrotron radiations in detail.
Radiation peculiarities caused by the presence of the solenoid may be
considered as a manifestation of Aharonov-Bohm effect in the radiation. In
particular, it is shown that new spectral lines appear in the radiation
spectrum. Due to angular distribution peculiarities of the radiation intensity,
these lines can in principle be isolated from basic cyclotron and synchrotron
radiation spectra
