  A non-perturbative confinement mechanism has been proposed to explain the
fate of the unbroken gauge group on the world-volume of annihilating
D-brane-anti-D-brane pairs. In this paper, we examine this phenomenon closely
from several different perspectives. Existence of the confinement mechanism is
most easily seen by noticing that the fundamental string emerges as the
confined electric flux string at the end of the annihilation process. After
reviewing the confinement proposal in general, this is shown explicitly in the
D2-anti-D2 case in the M-theory limit. Finally, we address the crucial issue of
whether and how confinement occurs in the weakly coupled limit of string
theory.
