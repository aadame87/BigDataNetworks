Authors: Thomas Mohaupt
Comments: 64 pages, based on lectures given at the school of the TMR network
  'Quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry and unification' in Torino,
  January 26 - February 2, 2000. To be published in Class. Quant. Grav. (Some

  We give an elementary introduction to black holes in supergravity and string
theory. The focus is on BPS solutions in four- and higher-dimensional
supergravity and string theory. Basic ideas and techniques are explained in
detail, including exercises with solutions.
