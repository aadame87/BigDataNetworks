  We propose exact vacuum expectation values of local fields for a quantum
group restriction of the $C_2^{(1)}$ affine Toda theory which corresponds to
two coupled minimal models. The central charge of the unperturbed models ranges
from $c=1$ to $c=2$, where the perturbed models correspond to two magnetically
coupled Ising models and Heisenberg spin ladders, respectively. As an
application, in the massive phase we deduce the leading term of the asymptotics
of the two-point correlation functions.
