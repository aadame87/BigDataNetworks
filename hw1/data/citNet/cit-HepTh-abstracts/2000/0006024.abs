Title: Black Holes and Spacetime Physics in String/M Theory

  In addition to briefly reviewing recent progress in studying black hole
physics in string/M theory, we describe several robust features pertaining to
spacetime physics that one can glean by studying quantum physics of black
holes. In particular, we review 't Hooft's S-matrix ansatz which results in a
noncommutative horizon. A recent construction of fuzzy AdS2 is emphasized, this
is a nice toy model for fuzzy black hole horizon. We demonstrate that this
model captures some nonperturbative features of quantum gravity.
