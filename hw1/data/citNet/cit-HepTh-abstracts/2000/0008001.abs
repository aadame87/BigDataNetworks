  We find the gravity solution corresponding to a large number of NS or D
fivebranes wrapped on a two sphere so that we have pure ${\cal N}=1$ super
Yang-Mills in the IR. The supergravity solution is smooth, it shows confinement
and it breaks the $U(1)_R$ chiral symmetry in the appropriate way. When the
gravity approximation is valid the masses of glueballs are comparable to the
masses of Kaluza Klein states on the fivebrane, but if we could quantize
strings on this background it looks like we should be able to decouple the KK
states.
