  The `winding state' behavior appears in the two-loop nonplanar contribution
to the partition function in thermal noncommutative field theories. We derive
this feature directly from the purely open string theory analysis in the
presence of the constant background $B$-field; we compute the two-loop
partition function for worldsheets with a handle and a boundary when the time
direction of the Euclideanized target space is compactified. In contrast to the
closed-string-inspired approach, it is not necessary to add infinite number of
extra degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we find a piece of supporting evidence
toward the conjecture that, in the UV limit, the noncommutativity parameter
plays the role of the effective string scale in noncommutative field theories.
