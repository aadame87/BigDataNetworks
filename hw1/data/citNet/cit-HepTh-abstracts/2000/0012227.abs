  In quantum field theory the parameters of the vacuum action are subject to
renormalization group running. In particular, the ``cosmological constant'' is
not a constant in a quantum field theory context, still less should be zero. In
this paper we continue with previous work, and derive the particle
contributions to the running of the cosmological and gravitational constants in
the framework of the Standard Model in curved space-time. At higher energies
the calculation is performed in a sharp cut off approximation. We assess, in
two different frameworks, whether the scaling dependences of the cosmological
and gravitational constants spoil primordial nucleosynthesis. Finally, the
cosmological implications of the running of the cosmological constant are
discussed.
