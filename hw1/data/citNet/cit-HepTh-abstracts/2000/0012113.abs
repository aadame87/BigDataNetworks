Title: Superspace interpretation of mass-dependent BRST symmetries in general
  gauge theories
Authors: Bodo Geyer and Dietmar Muelsch
Comments: 6 pages, LATEX
\\
  A superspace formulation is proposed for the osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian
quantization of general massive gauge theories. Thereby, osp(1,2) is considered
as subalgebra of the superalgebra sl(1,2) which is interpreted as conformal
algebra acting on two anticommuting coordinates. The mass-dependent (anti)BRST
symmetries of the quantum action in the osp(1,2) superfield formalism are
realized as translations associated by mass-dependent special conformal
transformations.
