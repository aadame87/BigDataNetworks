  $p'$-brane solutions to rank $p+1$ composite antisymmetric tensor field
theories of the kind developed by Guendelman, Nissimov and Pacheva are found
when the dimensionality of spacetime is $D=(p+1)+(p'+1)$. These field theories
posses an infinite dimensional group of global Noether symmetries, that of
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the target space of the scalar primitive
field constituents. Crucial in the construction of $p'$ brane solutions are the
duality transformations of the fields and the local gauge field theory
formulation of extended objects given by Aurilia, Spallucci and Smailagic.
Field equations are rotated into Bianchi identities after the duality
transformation is performed and the Clebsch potentials associated with the
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the $p'$ brane can be identified with the
$duals$ of the original scalar primitive constituents. Different types of
Kalb-Ramond actions are discussed and a particular covariant action is
presented which bears a direct relation to the light-cone gauge $p$-brane
action. A simple derivation of $S$ and $T$ duality is also given. \medskip
