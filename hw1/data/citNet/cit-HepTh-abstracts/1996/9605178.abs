  Several physics aspects of the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory with SU(2) gauge group, supplemented with a small mass term
for the "matter" fields which leads to an $N=1$ theory with confinement, are
discussed. The light spectrum of the theory is understood on the basis of
current algebra relations, and CP invariance of the massless and massive
theories is studied. We find that in the massive (confining) theory the low
energy physics has an exact CP symmetry, while in a generic vacuum in the
massless theory CP invarince is spontaneously broken.
