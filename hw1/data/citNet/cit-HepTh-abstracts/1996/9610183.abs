  Einstein's $E = mc^{2}$ unifies the momentum-energy relations for massive and
massless particles. According to Wigner, the internal space-time symmetries of
massive and massless particles are isomorphic to $O(3)$ and $E(2)$
respectively. According to Inonu and Wigner, $O(3)$ can be contracted to $E(2)$
in the large-radius limit. It is noted that the $O(3)$-like little group for
massive particles can be contracted to the $E(2)$-like little group for
massless particles in the limit of large momentum and/or small mass. It is thus
shown that transverse rotational degrees of freedom for massive particles
become contracted to gauge degrees of freedom for massless particles.
