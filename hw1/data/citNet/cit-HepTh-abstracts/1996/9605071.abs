Title: TG-Equivariance of Connections and Gauge Transformations
Authors: H. M. Bosselmann, N.A. Papadopoulos
Comments: 12 pages
\\
  We consider the notion of a connection on a principal bundle $P(M,G)$ from
the point of view of the action of the tangential group $TG$. This leads to a
new definition of a connection and allows to interpret gauge transformations as
effect of the $TG$ action.
