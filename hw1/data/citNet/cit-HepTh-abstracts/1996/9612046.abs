  Various aspects of the theory of quantum integrable systems are reviewed.
Basic ideas behind the construction of integrable ultralocal and nonultralocal
quantum models are explored by exploiting the underlying algebraic structures
related to the Yang-Baxter equations. Physical meaning of abstract
mathematical notions like universal R-matrix, quantized algebras,
Sklyanin algebra, braided algebra, Hopf algebra etc. and the role played by
them in integrable systems are highlighted. Systematic construction of quantum
integrable lattice as well as field models and their exact excitation spectra
are presented through examples. The coordinate and algebraic formulations of
the Bethe ansatz are illustrated with comparison, along with the description of
nested and functional Bethe ansatzes. The techniques for deriving quantum
Hamiltonians from the Lax operators are demonstrated on concrete models. The
exposition of this review is kept in a fairly elementary level with emphasis on
the physical contents.
