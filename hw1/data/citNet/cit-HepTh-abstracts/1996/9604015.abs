  We present a relation which connects the propagator in the radial
(Fock-Schwinger) gauge with a gauge invariant Wilson loop. It is closely
related to the well-known field strength formula and can be used to calculate
the radial gauge propagator. The result is shown to diverge in four-dimensional
space even for free fields, its singular nature is however naturally explained
using the renormalization properties of Wilson loops with cusps and
self-intersections. Using this observation we provide a consistent
regularization scheme to facilitate loop calculations. Finally we compare our
results with previous approaches to derive a propagator in Fock-Schwinger
gauge.
