  The paper is devoted to the further study of the remarkable classes of
orthogonal polynomials recently discovered by Bender and Dunne. We show that
these polynomials can be generated by solutions of arbitrary quasi - exactly
solvable problems of quantum mechanichs both one-dimensional and
multi-dimensional. A general and model-independent method for building and
studying Bender-Dunne polynomials is proposed. The method enables one to
compute the weight functions for the polynomials and shows that they are the
orthogonal polynomials in a discrete variable $E_k$ which takes its values in
the set of exactly computable energy levels of the corresponding quasi-exactly
solvable model. It is also demonstrated that in an important particular case,
the Bender-Dunne polynomials exactly coincide with orthogonal polynomials
appearing in Lanczos tridiagonalization procedure.
