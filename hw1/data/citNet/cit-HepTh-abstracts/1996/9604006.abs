  The Green--Schwarz superstring action is modified to include some set of
additional (on-shell trivial) variables. A complete constraints system of the
theory turns out to be reducible both in the original and in additional
variable sectors. The initial $8s$ first class constraints and $8c$ second
class ones are shown to be unified with $8c$ first and $8s$ second class
constraints from the additional variables sector, resulting with
$SO(1,9)$-covariant and linearly independent constraint sets. Residual
reducibility proves to fall on second class constraints only.
