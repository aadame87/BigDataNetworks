\\
  We obtain direct, finite, descriptions of a renormalized quantum mechanical
system with no reference to ultraviolet cutoffs and running coupling constants,
in both the Hamiltonian and path integral pictures. The path integral
description requires a modification to the Wiener measure on continuous paths
that describes an unusual diffusion process wherein colliding particles
occasionally stick together for a random interval of time before going their
separate ways.
