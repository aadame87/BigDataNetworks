  The statistical-mechanical origin of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S^{BH}$
in the induced gravity is discussed. In the framework of the induced gravity
models the Einstein action arises as the low energy limit of the effective
action of quantum fields. The induced gravitational constant is determined by
the masses of the heavy constituents. We established the explicit relation
between statistical entropy of constituent fields and black hole entropy
$S^{BH}$.
