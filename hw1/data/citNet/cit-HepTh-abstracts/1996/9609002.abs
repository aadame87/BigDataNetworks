  It is shown that fractional $Z_3$-superspace is isomorphic to the
$q\to\exp(2\pi i/3)$ limit of the braided line. $Z_3$-supersymmetry is
identified as translational invariance along this line. The fractional
translation generator and its associated covariant derivative emerge as the
$q\to\exp(2\pi i/3)$ limits of the left and right derivatives from the calculus
on the braided line
