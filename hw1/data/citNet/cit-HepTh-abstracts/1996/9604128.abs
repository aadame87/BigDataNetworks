  A generating function is given for the number, $E(l,k)$, of irreducible
$k$-fold Euler sums, with all possible alternations of sign, and exponents
summing to $l$. Its form is remarkably simple: $\sum_n E(k+2n,k) x^n =
\sum_{d|k}\mu(d) (1-x^d)^{-k/d}/k$, where $\mu$ is the M\"obius function.
Equivalently, the size of the search space in which $k$-fold Euler sums of
level $l$ are reducible to rational linear combinations of irreducible basis
terms is $S(l,k) = \sum_{n<k}{\lfloor(l+n-1)/2\rfloor\choose n}$. Analytical
methods, using Tony Hearn's REDUCE, achieve this reduction for the 3698
convergent double Euler sums with $l\leq44$; numerical methods, using David
Bailey's MPPSLQ, achieve it for the 1457 convergent $k$-fold sums with
$l\leq7$; combined methods yield bases for all remaining search spaces with
$S(l,k)\leq34$. These findings confirm expectations based on Dirk Kreimer's
connection of knot theory with quantum field theory. The occurrence in
perturbative quantum electrodynamics of all 12 irreducible Euler sums with
$l\leq 7$ is demonstrated. It is suggested that no further transcendental
occurs in the four-loop contributions to the electron's magnetic moment.
Irreducible Euler sums are found to occur in explicit analytical results, for
counterterms with up to 13 loops, yielding transcendental knot-numbers, up to
23 crossings.
