  The loop transform in quantum gauge field theory can be recognized as the
Fourier transform (or characteristic functional) of a measure on the space of
generalized connections modulo gauge transformations. Since this space is a
compact Hausdorff space, conversely, we know from the Riesz-Markov theorem that
every positive linear functional on the space of continuous functions thereon
qualifies as the loop transform of a regular Borel measure on the moduli
space. In the present article we show how one can compute the finite joint
distributions of a given characteristic functional, that is, we derive the
inverse loop transform.
