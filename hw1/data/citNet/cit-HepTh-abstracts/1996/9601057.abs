  The scattering of R-R gauge bosons off of Dirichlet p-branes is computed to
leading order in the string coupling. The results are qualitatively similar to
those found in the scattering of massless NS-NS bosons: all p-branes with p >=
0 exhibit stringy properties, in particular the Regge behavior. Both the R-R
and NS-NS scattering amplitudes agree in the limit of small momentum transfer
with scattering off the extremal R-R charged p-brane solutions found in the
low-energy supergravities. We interpret this as evidence that Dirichlet-branes
are an exact world-sheet description of the extremal p-branes. The -1-brane
(D-instanton) is a special object which, unlike all other Dirichlet-branes,
exhibits point-like behavior. We find the R-R charged instanton solution to
type IIB supergravity and confirm that the field theoretic scattering off of
this solution miraculously reproduces the full stringy calculation. As an
aside, we include a discussion of the entropy of non-extremal black holes in
ten dimensions, produced by exciting the 0-brane. We show that, for large black
holes, the entropy grows linearly with the black hole mass.
