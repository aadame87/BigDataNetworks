  The combined method of Higher Covariant Derivatives and Pauli-Villars
regularization to regularize pure Yang-Mills theories is formulated in the
framework of Batalin and Vilkovisky. However, BRS invariance is broken by this
method and suitable counterterms should be added to restore it. The one loop
counterterm is presented. Contrary to the scheme of Slavnov, this method is
regularizing and leads to consistent renormalization group functions, which are
the same as those found by other regularization schemes.
