  We begin with personal notes describing the atmosphere of "Bogoliubov
renormalization group" birth. Then we expose the history of RG discovery in the
QFT and of the RG method devising in the mid-fifties. The third part is devoted
to proliferation of RG ideas into diverse parts of theoretical physics. We
conclude with discussing the perspective of RG method further development and
its application in mathematical physics.
