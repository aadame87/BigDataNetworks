  We consider slightly non-extremal black 3-branes of type IIB supergravity and
show that their Bekenstein-Hawking entropy agrees with the counting of states
of the Dirichlet 3-brane. The Dirichlet brane excitations are described in
terms of the statistical mechanics of a 3+1 dimensional gas of massless open
string states. This is essentially the classic problem of black body radiation.
The black body temperature is shown to be identical with the temperature of the
Hawking radiation. We also construct a solution of type IIB supergravity
describing a 3-brane with a finite density of longitudinal momentum. For
extremal momentum-carrying 3-branes the horizon area vanishes. This is in
agreement with the fact that the BPS entropy of the momentum-carrying Dirichlet
3-branes is not an extensive quantity.
