  As in an earlier paper we start from the hypothesis that physics on the
Planck scale should be described by means of concepts taken from ``discrete
mathematics''. This goal is realized by developing a scheme being based on the
dynamical evolution of a particular class of ``cellular networks'' being
capable of performing an ``unfolding phase transition'' from a (presumed)
chaotic initial phase towards a new phase which acts as an ``attractor'' in
total phase space and which carries a fine or super structure which is
identified as the discrete substratum underlying ordinary continuous space-time
(or rather, the physical vacuum). Among other things we analyze the internal
structure of certain particular subclusters of nodes/bonds (maximal connected
subsimplices, $mss$) which are the fundamental building blocks of this new
phase and which are conjectured to correspond to the ``physical points'' of
ordinary space-time. Their mutual entanglement generates a certain near- and
far-order, viz. a causal structure within the network which is again set into
relation with the topological/metrical and causal/geometrical structure of
continuous space-time. The mathematical techniques to be employed consist
mainly of a blend of a fair amount of ``stochastic mathematics'' with several
relatively advanced topics of discrete mathematics like the ``theory of
random graphs'' or ``combinatorial graph theory''. Our working philosophy is
it to create a scenario in which it becomes possible to identify both gravity
and quantum theory as the two dominant but derived(!) aspects of an underlying
discrete and more primordial theory (dynamical cellular network) on a much
coarser level of resolution, viz. continuous space-time.
