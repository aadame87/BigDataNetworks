  The vacuum energy of a scalar field in a spherically symmetric background
field is considered. It is expressed through the Jost function of the
corresponding scattering problem. The renormalization is discussed in detail
and performed using the uniform asymptotic expansion of the Jost function. The
method is demonstrated in a simple explicit example.
