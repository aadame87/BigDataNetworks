  This paper contains the lecture notes of a short course on the quantization
of gauge theories. Starting from a sketchy review of scattering theory, the
paper describes the lines of BRST-Faddeev-Popov quantization considering the
problem of a non-perturbative extension of this method. The connection between
Slavnov-Taylor identity and S-matrix unitarity is also discussed.
