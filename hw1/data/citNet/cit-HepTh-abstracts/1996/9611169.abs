  We consider a generalized three-dimensional theory of gravity which is
specified by two fields, the graviton and the dilaton, and one parameter. This
theory contains, as particular cases, three-dimensional General Relativity and
three-dimensional String Theory. Stationary black hole solutions are generated
from the static ones using a simple coordinate transformation. The stationary
black holes solutions thus obtained are locally equivalent to the corresponding
static ones, but globally distinct. The mass and angular momentum of the
stationary black hole solutions are computed using an extension of the Regge
and Teitelboim formalism. The causal structure of the black holes is
described.
