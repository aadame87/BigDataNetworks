Title: Lectures on Superstring and M Theory Dualities
Author: John H. Schwarz
Comments: 67 pages, latex, 1 figure; Lectures given at the ICTP Spring School
  (March 1996) and the TASI Summer School (June 1996), TASI96

  These lectures begin by reviewing the evidence for S duality of the
toroidally compactified heterotic string in 4d that was obtained in the period
1992--94. Next they review recently discovered dualities that relate all five
of the 10d superstring theories and a quantum extension of 11d supergravity
called M theory. The study of p-branes of various dimensions (some of which are
D-branes) plays a central role. The final sections survey supersymmetric string
vacua in 6d and some of the dual constructions by which they can be obtained.
Special emphasis is given to a class of N=1 models that exhibit
``heterotic-heterotic duality.''
