  This thesis is devoted to trying to find a microscopic quantum description of
black holes. We consider black holes in string theory which is a quantum theory
of gravity. We find that the ``area law'' black hole entropy for extremal and
near-extremal charged black holes arises from counting microscopic
configurations. We study black holes in five and four spacetime dimensions. We
calculate the Hawking temperature and give a physical picture of the Hawking
decay process. Hopefully, the reader will find here a moderately self contained
review of D-branes and string theory applied to black hole physics.
