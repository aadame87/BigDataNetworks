  We show how to find explicit expressions for rigid string instantons for
general 4-manifold $M$. It appears that they are pseudo-holomorphic curves in
the twistor space of $M$. We present explicit formulae for $M=R^4, S^4$. We
discuss their properties and speculate on relations to topology of 4-manifolds
and the theory of Yang-Mills fields.
