  We construct asymptotic solutions of the functional Schroedinger equation for
a scalar field in the Gaussian approximation at large proper time. These
solutions describe the late proper time stages of the expansion of a meson gas
with boost invariant boundary conditions. The relevance of these solutions for
the formation of a disoriented chiral condensate in ultra relativistic
collisions is discussed.
