  We show that the most general stationary electrically charged black-hole
solutions of the heterotic string compactified on a (10-D)-torus (where D > 3)
can be obtained by using the solution generating transformations of Sen acting
on the Myers and Perry metric. The conserved charges labeling these black-hole
solutions are the mass, the angular momentum in all allowed commuting planes,
and 36-2D electric charges. General properties of these black-holes are also
studied.
