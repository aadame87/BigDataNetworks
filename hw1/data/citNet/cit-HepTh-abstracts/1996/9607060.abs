  The operator product expansion in four-dimensional superconformal field
theory is discussed. The OPE takes a particularly simple form for chiral
operators, in $N=1$ and $N=2$, and for analytic operators, in $N=2$ and $N=4$.
It is argued that the Green's functions of such operators can be determined up
to constants.
