Title: Virasoro-type Symmetries in Solvable Models
Authors: H. Awata, H. Kubo, S. Odake and J. Shiraishi
Comments: LaTeX file, 35 pages
\\
  Virasoro-type symmetries and their roles in solvable models are reviewed.
These symmetries are described by the two-parameter Virasoro-type algebra
$Vir_{p,q}$ by choosing the parameters p and q suitably.
