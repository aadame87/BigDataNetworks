  The Narain lattice construction of string compactifications is generalized to
include spontaneously broken supersymmetry. Consistency conditions from modular
invariance and Lorentz symmetry are solved in full generality. This framework
incorporates models where supersymmetry breaking is inversely proportional to
the radii of compact dimensions. The enhanced lattice description, however,
might allow for models with a different geometrical or even non-geometrical
interpretation.
