  Covariant forms are given to a gauge theory of massive tensor field. This is
accomplished by introducing another auxiliary field of scalar type to the
system composed of a symmetric tensor field and an auxiliary field of vector
type. The situation is compared to the case of the theory in which a tensor
field describes a scalar ghost as well as an ordinary massive tensor. In this
case only an auxiliary vector field is needed to give covariant expressions for
the gauge theory.
