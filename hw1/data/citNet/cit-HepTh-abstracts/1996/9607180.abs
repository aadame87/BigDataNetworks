Title: The Super P-Brane Scan and S Duality
Author: Khaled Abdel-Khalek (Phys. Dept./Lecce Univ.)
\\
  Taking into account the recent dualities we rederive the super p-brane scan.
Our main results are the importance of the metric's signature and the existence
of an S self-dual super 5-brane at D=14 with signature (7,7) or (11,3).
