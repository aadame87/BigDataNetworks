Title: On the Casimir of the group ISL(n,R) and its algebraic decomposition
Author: J.N. Pecina-Cruz
\\
  In this article a formula for the Casimir of ISL(n,R) is given. This
algebraic expression is useful in the classification of particles in a theory
based on ISL(n,R). It is also proven that the Casimir of ISL(n,R) can be
decomposed in terms of the Casimir of its little groups, a key point in the
posterior construction of its irreducible representations.
