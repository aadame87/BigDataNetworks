\\
  A supersymmetry anomaly is found in the presence of non-perturbative fields.
When the action is expressed in terms of the correct quantum variables,
anomalous surface terms appear in its supersymmetric variation - one per each
collective coordinate. The anomalous surface terms do not vanish in general
when inserted in two- or higher-loop bubble diagrams, and generate a violation
of the SUSY Ward identities.
