  We apply differential renormalization method to the study of
three-dimensional topologically massive Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons theories.
The method is especially suitable for such theories as it avoids the need for
dimensional continuation of three-dimensional antisymmetric tensor and the
Feynman rules for three-dimensional theories in coordinate space are relatively
simple. The calculus involved is still lengthy but not as difficult as other
existing methods of calculation. We compute one-loop propagators and vertices
and derive the one-loop local effective action for topologically massive
Yang-Mills theory. We then consider Chern-Simons field theory as the large mass
limit of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and show that this leads to
the famous shift in the parameter $k$. Some useful formulas for the calculus of
differential renormalization of three-dimensional field theories are given in
an Appendix.
