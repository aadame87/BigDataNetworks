  Within the framework of semiclassical QCD approximations the short distance
behavior of two static color charges in (2+1)-dimensional QCD is discussed. A
classical linearization of the field equations is exhibited and leads to
analytical results producing the static potential. Beyond the dominant
classical part proportional to ln lambda R, QCD contributions of order R^1/2
and R are found.
