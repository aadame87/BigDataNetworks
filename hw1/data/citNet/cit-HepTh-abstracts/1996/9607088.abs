  The two flavour, four dimensional WZW model coupled to electromagnetism, is
treated as a constraint system in the context of the Faddeev-Jackiw approach.
No approximation is made. Detailed exposition of the calculations is given.
Solution of the constraints followed by proper Darboux's transformations leads
to an unconstrained Coulomb-gauge Lagrangian density.
