  We give a review of the exact renormalization group (ERG) approach and
illustrate its applications in scalar and fermionic theories. The derivative
expansion and approximations based on the derivative expansion with further
truncation in the number of fields (mixed approximation) are discussed. We
analyse the mixed approximation for a three-dimensional scalar theory and show
that it is less effective than the pure derivative expansion. For pure
fermionic theories analytical solutions for the pure derivative expansion and
mixed approximation in the limit $N \to \infty $, where $N$ is the number of
fermionic species, are found. For finite $N$ a few series of fixed point
solutions with their anomalous dimensions and critical exponents are computed
numerically. We argue that one of the fermionic solutions can be identified
with that of Dashen and Frishman, whereas the others seem to be new ones. The
issues of spurious solutions and scheme dependence of the results are
discussed.
