  In a recent paper Townsend suggested to associate to the D=11 solitonic
membrane of N=1 supergravity a certain thickness, and then to identify this
membrane with the fundamental supermembrane. By integrating out the 8
transverse dimensions of the "thick" solitonic membrane, we show that the
resulting world-volume action indeed contains all the usual supermembrane
terms, as well as background curvature terms and extrinsic curvature terms,
which are believed to render the membrane spectrum discrete. We also outline
the analog derivation for the "thick" D=10 solitonic string solution of N=IIA
supergravity. The resulting world-sheet action contains the usual type IIA
superstring terms, as well as extra terms whose presence can be interpreted as
a rescaling of the background metric, thus preserving kappa-symmetry and
conformal invariance.
