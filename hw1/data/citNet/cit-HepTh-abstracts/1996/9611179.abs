  We obtain the general static solutions of the axially symmetric
(2+1)-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory by dimensionally reducing it
to a 2-dimensional dilaton gravity theory. The solutions consist of the
magnetically charged sector and the electrically charged sector. We illuminate
the relationship between the two sectors by pointing out the transformations
between them.
