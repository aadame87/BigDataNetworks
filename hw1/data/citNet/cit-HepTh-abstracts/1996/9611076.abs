Title: Supergravities in diverse dimensions and their central extension
Authors: L. Andrianopoli and R. D'Auria
Comments: 10 pages, LaTeX; Talk given at the WorkShop on Gauge Theories,
  Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity, London, 5-10 July 1996
\\
  In this lecture moduli dependent charges for p-extended objects are analyzed
for generic N-extended supergravities in dimensions 4 \leq D <10. Differential
relations and sum rules among the charges are derived.
