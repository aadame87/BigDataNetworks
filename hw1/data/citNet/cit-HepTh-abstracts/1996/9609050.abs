  This thesis uses Path Integrals and Green's Functions to study Gravity,
Quantum Field Theory and Statistical Mechanics, particularly with respect to:
finite temperature quantum systems of different spin in gravitational fields;
finite temperature interacting quantum systems in perturbative regime;
self-interacting fermi models in non-trivial space-time of different
dimensions; non-linear quantum models at finite temperatures in a background
curved space-time; 3-D topological field models in non-trivial space-time and
at finite temperatures; thermal quantum systems in a background curved
space-time. Results include: Non-Equivalence of Inertial and Gravitational
Mass.
