  Dimensions

  We investigate some properties of a first-order polynomial formulation of the
U(1) non-linear sigma-model in two Euclidean dimensions. The variables in this
description are a 1-form field plus a 0-form Lagrange multiplier field. The
usual spin variables are non-local functions of the new fields. As this
construction incorporates O(2) invariance ab initio, only O(2)-invariant
correlation functions (the only non-vanishing ones in the model) can be
constructed. We show that the vortices play a dual role to the spin variables
in the partition function. The equivalent Sine-Gordon description is obtained
in a natural way, when one integrates out the 1-form field to get an effective
partition function for the Lagrange multiplier. We also show how to introduce
strings of vortices within this formulation.
