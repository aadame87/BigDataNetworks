  We reinterpret the Faddeev-Popov gauge-fixing procedure of Yang-Mills
theories as the definition of a topological quantum field theory for gauge
group elements depending on a background connection. This has the advantage of
relating topological gauge-fixing ambiguities to the global breaking of a
supersymmetry. The global zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts are handled in
the context of an equivariant cohomology without breaking translational
invariance. The gauge-fixing involves constant fields which play the role of
moduli and modify the behavior of Green functions at subasymptotic scales. At
the one loop level physical implications from these power corrections are gauge
invariant.
