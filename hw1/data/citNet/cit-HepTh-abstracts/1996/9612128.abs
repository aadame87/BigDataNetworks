  Domain walls in strongly coupled gauge theories are discussed. A general
mechanism is suggested automatically leading to massless gauge bosons localized
on the wall. In one of the models considered, outside the wall the theory is in
the non-Abelian confining phase, while inside the wall it is in the Abelian
Coulomb phase. Confining property of the non-Abelian theories is a key
ingredient of the mechanism which may be of practical use in the context of the
dynamic compactification scenarios.
  In supersymmetric (N=1) Yang-Mills theories the energy density of the wall
can be exactly calculated in the strong coupling regime. This calculation
presents a further example of non-trivial physical quantities that can be found
exactly by exploiting specific properties of supersymmetry. A key observation
is the fact that the wall in this theory is a BPS-saturated state.
