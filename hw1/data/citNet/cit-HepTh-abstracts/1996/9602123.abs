Title: Wilsonian vs. 1PI renormalization group flow irreversibility
Authors: Jordi Comellas and Jose I. Latorre
Comments: 9 pages, LaTeX, no figures. An error in section 2 (which does not
  affect sections 3 and 4) invalidates the flow equation for $c_W$. The paper
  has been temporarily withdrawn from publication
\\
  We present a line of reasoning based on the analysis of scale variations of
the Wilsonian partition function and the trace of the stress tensor in a curved
manifold which results in a statement of irreversibility of Wilsonian
renormalization group flow for unitary theories. We also analyze subtleties
related to subtractions in the case of the 1PI effective action flow.
