  A reformulation of the superconformal Ward identities that combines all the
superconformal currents and the associated parameters in one multiplet is given
for theories with rigid N=1 or N=2 supersymmetry. This form of the Ward
Identities is applied to spontaneously broken N=2 Yang-Mills theory and used to
derive a condition on the low energy effective action. This condition is
satisfied by the solution proposed by Seiberg and Witten.
