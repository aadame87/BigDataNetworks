  When the swimming of micro-organisms is viewed from the string and membrane
theories coupled to the velocity field of the fluid, a number of interesting
results are derived; 1) importance of the area (or volume) preserving algebra,
2) usefulness of the $N$-point Reggeon (membranic) amplitudes, and of the gas
to liquid transition in case of the red tide issues, 3) close relation between
the red tide issue and the generation of Einstein gravity, and 4) possible
understanding of the three different swimming ways of micro-organisms from the
singularity structure of the shape space.
