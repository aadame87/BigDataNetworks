  A precise definition of an adiabaticity parameter $\nu$ of a time-dependent
Hamiltonian is proposed. A variation of the time-dependent perturbation theory
is presented which yields a series expansion of the evolution operator
$U(\tau)=\sum_\ell U^{(\ell)}(\tau)$ with $U^{(\ell)}(\tau)$ being at least of
the order $\nu^\ell$. In particular $U^{(0)}(\tau)$ corresponds to the
adiabatic approximation and yields Berry's adiabatic phase. It is shown that
this series expansion has nothing to do with the $1/\tau$-expansion of
$U(\tau)$. It is also shown that the non-adiabatic part of the evolution
operator is generated by a transformed Hamiltonian which is off-diagonal in the
eigenbasis of the initial Hamiltonian. Some related issues concerning the
geometric phase are also discussed.
