  We construct the form factors of the trace of energy-momentum tensor for the
massless model described by $SU(2)$ principal chiral field model with WZNW tern
on level 1. We explain how this construction can be generalized to a class of
integrable massless models including the flow from tricritical to critical
Ising model.
