  Some bosonic solutions of supergravities admit Killing spinors of unbroken
supersymmetry. The anti-Killing spinors of broken supersymmetry can be used to
generate the superpartners of stringy black holes. This has a consequent
feedback on the metric and the graviphoton. We have found however that the
fixed scalars for the black hole superpartners remain the same as for the
original black holes. Possible phenomenological implications of this result are
discussed.
