  Making use of the exact solutions of the $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories
we construct new classes of superconformal field theories (SCFTs) by
fine-tuning the moduli parameters and bringing the theories to critical points.
In the case of SCFTs constructed from pure gauge theories without matter $N=2$
critical points seem to be classified according to the A-D-E classification as
in the two-dimensional SCFTs.
