  The quantization of spontaneously broken gauge theories in noncommutative
geometry(NCG) has been sought for some time, because quantization is crucial
for making the NCG approach a reliable and physically acceptable theory. Lee,
Hwang and Ne'eman recently succeeded in realizing the BRST quantization of
gauge theories in NCG in the matrix derivative approach proposed by Coquereaux
et al. The present author has proposed a characteristic formulation to
reconstruct a gauge theory in NCG on the discrete space $M_4\times Z_{_N}$.
Since this formulation is a generalization of the differential geometry on the
ordinary manifold to that on the discrete manifold, it is more familiar than
other approaches. In this paper, we show that within our formulation we can
obtain the BRST invariant Lagrangian in the same way as Lee, Hwang and Ne'eman
and apply it to the SU(2)$\times$U(1) gauge theory.
