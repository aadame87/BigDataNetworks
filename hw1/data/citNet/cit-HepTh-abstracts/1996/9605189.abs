  A 'differential measure' is used to cast our calculus for the group $SU(3)$
into a form similar to Schwinger's boson operator calculus for the group
$SU(2)$. It is then applied to compute (i) the inner product between the basis
states and (ii) an algebraic formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These
were obtained earlier by us using Gaussian integration techniques.
