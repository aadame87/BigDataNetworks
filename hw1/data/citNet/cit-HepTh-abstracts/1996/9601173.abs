  We review a manifestly supersymmetric off-shell formulation of a wide class
of torsionful $(4,4)$ $2D$ sigma models and their massive deformations in the
harmonic superspace with a double set of $SU(2)$ harmonic variables. Sigma
models with both commuting and non-commuting left and right complex structures
are treated.
