Title: Bosonized Formulation of Lattice QCD
Author: A.A. Slavnov
Comments: 6 pages, latex, no figures Talk, presented at XYIII International
  Seminar "Relativistic nuclear physics and Quantum Chromodynamics", Dubna,
  September 1996
\\
  Problems in lattice gauge models with fermions are discussed. A new bosonic
Hermitean effective action for lattice QCD with dynamical quarks is presented.
In distinction of the previous version, it does not include constraints and is
better suited for Monte-Carlo simulations.
