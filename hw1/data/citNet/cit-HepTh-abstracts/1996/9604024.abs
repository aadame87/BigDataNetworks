\\
  An oscillator algebra and the associated Fock space with reflecting boundary
and generalized statistics are constructed and is generalized to the
multicomponent case. The oscillator algebra depends manifestly on the
reflection factor and the statistical (exchange) factor, and the corresponding
Fock space can be obtained from that of the usual bosonic oscillator without
reflection condition by certain projection operation.
