  Chern-Simons-Matter Lagrangian with noncompact gauge symmetry group is
considered. The theory is quantized in the holomorphic gauge with a complex
gauge fixing condition. The model is discussed, in which the the gauge and
matter fields are accompanied by the complex conjugate counterparts. It is
argued, that such a theory represents an adequate framework for the description
of the quantum Hall states.
