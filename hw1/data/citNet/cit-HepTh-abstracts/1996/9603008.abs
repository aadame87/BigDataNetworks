  One-string-loop (torus topology) corrections to black-string backgrounds
corresponding to gauged ${SL(2,R)\times R}/R$ WZW model are calculated using
$\beta$-function equations derived from string-loop-corrected effective action.
Loop-corrected backgrounds are used to calculate ADM mass of the black string.
