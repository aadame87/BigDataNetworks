  A general system constrained with {\it several} initial constraint conditions
is quantized based on the Dirac formalism and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for
this system is obtained. These constraint conditions are now allowed to depend
not only on the coordinates but also on the velocities. It is shown that the
hermiticity for the observables of the system restricts the geometrical
structure of our world.
