Title:  On the Exact Quantum Integrability of the Membrane

  The exact quantum integrability problem of the membrane is investigated. It
is found that the spherical membrane moving in flat target spacetime
backgrounds is an exact quantum integrable system for a particular class of
solutions of the light-cone gauge equations of motion : a dimensionally-reduced
$SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills theory to one temporal dimension. Crucial ingredients
are the exact integrability property of the $3D~SU(\infty)$ continuous Toda
theory and its associated dimensionally-reduced $SU(\infty)$ Toda $molecule$
equation whose symmetry algebra is the $U_\infty$ algebra obtained from a
dimensional-reducion of the $W_\infty \oplus {\bar W}_\infty$ algebras that act
naturally on the original $3D$ continuous Toda theory. The $U_\infty$ algebra
is explicitly constructed in terms of exact quantum solutions of the quantized
continuous Toda equation. Highest weight irreducible representations of the
$W_\infty$ algebras are also studied in detail. Continuous and discrete energy
levels are both found in the spectrum . Other relevant topics are discussed in
the conclusion.
