  We give an exposition of a technique, based on the Zwanzig projection
formalism, to construct the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix
corresponding to the n-particle sector of a field theory. We consider the case
of a scalar field with a $g \phi^3$ interaction as an example and construct the
master equation at the lowest non-zero order in perturbation theory.
