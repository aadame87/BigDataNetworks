  The problem of computing the thermodynamic properties of a one-dimensional
gas of particles which transform in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group and interact through non-Abelian electric fields is formulated and solved
in the large $N$ limit. The explicit solution exhibits a first order
confinement-deconfinement phase transition with computable properties and
describes two dimensional adjoint QCD in the limit where matter field masses
are large.
