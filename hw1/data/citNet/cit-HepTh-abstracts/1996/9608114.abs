  Dynamics of many supersymmetric monopoles are studied in the low energy
approximation. A conjecture for the exact moduli space metric is given for all
collections of fundamental monopoles of distinct type, and various partial
confirmations of the conjecture are discussed. Upon the quantization of the
resulting multi-monopole dynamics in the context of $N=4$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills-Higgs theories, one recovers the missing magnetic states that are
dual to some of the massive vector mesons. A generalization to monopoles with
nonabelian charges is also discussed.
