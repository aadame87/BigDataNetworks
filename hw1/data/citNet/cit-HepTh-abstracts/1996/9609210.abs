  We explicitly construct soliton operators in $D<2$ (or $c<1$) string theory,
and show that the Schwinger-Dyson equations allow solutions with these solitons
as backgrounds. The dominant contributions from 1-soliton background are
explicitly evaluated in the weak coupling limit, and shown to agree with the
nonperturbative analysis of string equations. We suggest that fermions should
be treated as fundamental dynamical variables since both macroscopic loops and
solitons are constructed in their bilinear forms.
