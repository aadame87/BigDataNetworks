Title: Superstrings in the geometrical approach and constrained super--WZNW
  models
Authors: Dmitri Sorokin
Comments: LaTeX file, 8 pages. Based on talks given at the INTAS Network
  Workshop on "Fundamental Problems in Classical, Quantum and String Gravity"
  (Torino, 2-3 May, 1996), The International Conference on "Problems of Quantum
  Field Theory" (Alushta, 13-18 May, 1996) and The Second International
  Sakharov Conference on Physics (Moscow, 20-24 May, 1996)
Report-no: DFPD 96/TH/36
\\
  By use of geometrical methods of surface theory we demonstrate links of
Green-Schwarz superstring dynamics with supersymmetric exactly-solvable
nonlinear systems and super-WZNW models reduced in an appropriate way.
