  The massive spinning particle in six-dimensional Minkowski space is described
as a mechanical system with the configuration space ${\ R}% ^{5,1}\times {\
CP}^3$. The action functional of the model is unambigiously determined by the
requirement of identical (off-shell) conservation for the phase-space
counterparts of three Casimir operators of Poincar\'e group. The model is shown
to be exactly solvable. Canonical quantization of the model leads to the
equations on wave functions which prove to be equivalent to the relativistic
wave equations for the irreducible $6d$ fields.
