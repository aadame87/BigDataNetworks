  We investigate the properties of a dressed electron which reduces, in a
particular class of gauges, to the usual fermion. A one loop calculation of the
propagator is presented. We show explicitly that an infra-red finite,
multiplicative, mass shell renormalisation is possible for this dressed
electron, or, equivalently, for the usual fermion in the abovementioned gauges.
The results are in complete accord with previous conjectures.
