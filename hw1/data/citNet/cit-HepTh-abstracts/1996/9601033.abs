Title: SU_q(n) Gauge Theory
Author: Anthony Sudbery
Comments: 10 pages, Latex. The abstract and introduction have been hyped up to
  indicate more clearly what parts are refreshed by this quantum-group gauge
  theory that other quantum-group gauge theories cannot reach. To be published
  in Physics Letters B
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Quantum Algebra
Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B375 (1996) 75-80

  A field theory with local transformations belonging to the quantum group
SU_q(n) is defined on a classical spacetime, with gauge potentials belonging to
a quantum Lie algebra. Gauge transformations are defined for the potentials
which lead to the appropriate quantum-group transformations for field strengths
and covariant derivatives, defined for all elements of SU_q(n) by means of the
adjoint action. This guarantees a non-trivial deformation. Gauge-invariant
commutation relations are identified.
