  We call a state "vacuum-bounded" if every measurement performed outside a
specified interior region gives the same result as in the vacuum. We compute
the maximum entropy of a vacuum-bounded state with a given energy for a
one-dimensional model, with the aid of numerical calculations on a lattice. The
maximum entropy is larger than it would be for rigid wall boundary conditions
by an amount $\delta S$ which for large energies is less than or approximately
$(1/6) ln (L_in T)$, where L_in is the length of the interior region. Assuming
that the state resulting from the evaporation of a black hole is similar to a
vacuum-bounded state, and that the similarity between vacuum-bounded and
rigid-wall-bounded problems extends from 1 to 3 dimensions, we apply these
results to the black hole information paradox. We conclude that large amounts
of information cannot be emitted in the final explosion of a black hole.
