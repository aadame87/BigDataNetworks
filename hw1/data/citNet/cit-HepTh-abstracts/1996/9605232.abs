  We discuss $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to two adjoint chiral superfields
$X$ and $Y$, and a number of fundamental chiral superfields $Q^i$. We add a
superpotential that has the form of Arnold's $D$ series $W = \Tr X^{k+1} + \Tr
XY^2$. We present a dual description in terms of an $SU(3kN_f - N_c)$ gauge
theory, and we show that the duality passes many tests. At the end of the
paper, we show how a deformation of this superpotential flows to another
duality having a product gauge group $SU(N_c)\times SU(N_c')$, with an adjoint
field charged under $SU(N_c)$, an adjoint field charged under $SU(N_c')$,
fields in the $(N_c,N_c')$ and $(\overline N_c,\overline N_c')$ representation,
and a number of fundamentals. The dual description is an $SU(2kN_f' + kN_f -
N_c')\times SU(2kN_f + kN_f' - N_c)$ gauge theory.
