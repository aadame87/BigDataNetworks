\\
  Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is considered in models which admit
descriptions in terms of electric, confined, or magnetic degrees of freedom in
various limits. In this way, a variety of seemingly different theories which
break supersymmetry are actually inter-related by confinement or duality.
Specific examples are given in which there are two dual descriptions of the
supersymmetry breaking ground state.
