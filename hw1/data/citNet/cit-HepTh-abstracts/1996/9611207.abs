  We present a new class of matrix models which are manifestly symmetric under
the T-duality transformation of the target space. The models may serve as a
nonperturbative regularization for the T-duality symmetry in continuum string
theory. In particular, it now becomes possible to extract winding modes
explicitly in terms of extended matrix variables.
