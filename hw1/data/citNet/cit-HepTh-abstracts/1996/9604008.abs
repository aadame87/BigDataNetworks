  A complete Fock space representation of the covariant differential calculus
on quantum space is constructed. The consistency criteria for the ensuing
algebraic structure, mapping to the canonical fermions and bosons and the
consequences of the new algebra for the statistics of quanta are analyzed and
discussed. The concept of statistical transmutation between bosons and fermions
is introduced.
