  The minimal bosonization of supersymmetry in terms of one bosonic degree of
freedom is considered. A nontrivial relationship of the construction to the
Witten supersymmetric quantum mechanics is illustrated with the help of the
simplest $N=2$ SUSY system realized on the basis of the ordinary (undeformed)
bosonic oscillator. It is shown that the generalization of such a construction
to the case of Vasiliev deformed bosonic oscillator gives a supersymmetric
extension of the 2-body Calogero model in the phase of exact or spontaneously
broken $N=2$ SUSY. The construction admits an extension to the case of the
OSp(2$\vert$2) supersymmetry, and, as a consequence, $osp(2\vert 2)$
superalgebra is revealed as a dynamical symmetry algebra for the bosonized
supersymmetric Calogero model. Realizing the Klein operator as a parity
operator, we construct the bosonized Witten supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
Here the general case of the corresponding bosonized $N=2$ SUSY is given by an
odd function being a superpotential.
