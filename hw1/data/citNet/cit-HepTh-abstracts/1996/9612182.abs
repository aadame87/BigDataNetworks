  In the context of D-dimensional Euclidean gravity, we define the natural
generalisation to D-dimensions of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations, as
duality conditions on the curvature 2-form of a Riemannian manifold.
Solutions to these self-duality equations are provided by manifolds of SU(2),
SU(3), G_2 and Spin(7) holonomy. The equations in eight dimensions are a
master set for those in lower dimensions. By considering gauge fields
propagating on these self-dual manifolds and embedding the spin connection in
the gauge connection, solutions to the D-dimensional equations for self-dual
Yang-Mills fields are found. We show that the Yang-Mills action on such
manifolds is topologically bounded from below, with the bound saturated
precisely when the Yang-Mills field is self-dual. These results have a natural
interpretation in supersymmetric string theory.
