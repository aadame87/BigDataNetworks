  We consider a $A_{N-1}$ type of spin dependent Calogero-Sutherland model,
containing an arbitrary representation of the permutation operators on the
combined internal space of all particles, and find that such a model can be
solved as easily as its standard $su(M)$ invariant counterpart through the
diagonalisation of Dunkl operators. A class of novel representations of the
permutation operator $P_{ij}$, which pick up nontrivial phase factors along
with interchanging the spins of $i$-th and $j$-th particles, are subsequently
constructed. These `anyon like' representations interestingly lead to different
variants of spin Calogero-Sutherland model with highly nonlocal interactions.
We also explicitly derive some exact eigenfunctions as well as energy
eigenvalues of these models and observe that the related degeneracy factors
crucially depend on the choice of a few discrete parameters which characterise
such anyon like representations.
