  The algebraic and Hamiltonian structures of the multicomponent dispersionless
Benney and Toda hierarchies are studied. This is achieved by using a modified
set of variables for which there is a symmetry between the basic fields. This
symmetry enables formulae normally given implicitly in terms of residues, such
as conserved charges and fluxes, to be calculated explicitly. As a corollary of
these results the equivalence of the Benney and Toda hierarchies is
established. It is further shown that such quantities may be expressed in terms
of generalized hypergeometric functions, the simplest example involving
Legendre polynomials. These results are then extended to systems derived from a
rational Lax function and a logarithmic function. Various reductions are also
studied.
