  We examine Bose-Einstein condensation as a form of symmetry breaking in the
specific model of the Einstein static universe. We show that symmetry breaking
never occursin the sense that the chemical potential $\mu$ never reaches its
critical value.This leads us to some statements about spaces of finite volume
in general. In an appendix we clarify the relationship between the standard
statistical mechanical approaches and the field theory method using zeta
functions.
