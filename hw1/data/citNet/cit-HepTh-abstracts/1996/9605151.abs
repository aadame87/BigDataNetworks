  We find the fusion rules for the c_{p,1} series of logarithmic conformal
field theories. This completes our attempts to generalize the concept of
rationality for conformal field theories to the logarithmic case. A novelty is
the appearance of negative fusion coefficients which can be understood in terms
of exceptional quantum group representations. The effective fusion rules (i.e.
without signs and multiplicities) resemble the BPZ fusion rules for the virtual
minimal models with conformal grid given via c = c_{3p,3}. This leads to the
conjecture that (almost) all minimal models with c = c_{p,q}, gcd(p,q) > 1,
belong to the class of rational logarithmic conformal field theories.
