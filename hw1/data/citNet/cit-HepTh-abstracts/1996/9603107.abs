  A string-like model with the "cosmological constant" $\Lambda$ is considered.
The Maki-Shiraishi multi-black-hole solution \cite{MS1} is generalized to
space-times with a Ricci-flat internal space. For $\Lambda = 0$ the obtained
solution in the one-black-hole case is shown to coincide with the extreme limit
of the charged dilatonic black hole solution \cite{BI,BM}. The Hawking
temperature $T_H$ for the solution \cite{BI,BM} is presented and its extreme
limit is considered. For the string value of dilatonic coupling the temperature
$T_H$ does not depend upon the internal space dimension.
