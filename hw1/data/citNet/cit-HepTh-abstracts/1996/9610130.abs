  Analytical harmonic superfields are the basic variables of a standard
harmonic formalism of SYM^2_4-theory. We consider superfield actions for
alternative formulations of this theory using the unconstrained harmonic
prepotentials. The corresponding equations of motion are equivalent to the
component field equations of SYM^2_4-theory. The analyticity condition
appears only on-shell as the zero-curvature equation in the alternative
formulations.
