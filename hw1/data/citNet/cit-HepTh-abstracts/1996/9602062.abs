  Using the topological membrane approach to string theory, we suggest a
geometric origin for the heterotic string. We show how different membrane
boundary conditions lead to different string theories. We discuss the
construction of closed oriented strings and superstrings, and demonstrate how
the heterotic construction naturally arises from a specific choice of boundary
conditions on the left and right boundaries of a cylindrical topological
membrane.
