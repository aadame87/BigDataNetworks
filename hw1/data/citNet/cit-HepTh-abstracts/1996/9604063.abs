  We discuss the issue of screening and confinement of external colour charges
in bosonised two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics. Our computation relies on
the static solutions of the semi-classical equations of motion. The
significance of the different representations of the matter field is explicitly
studied. We arrive at the conclusion that the screening phase prevails, even in
the presence of a small mass term for the fermions. To confirm this result
further, we outline the construction of operators corresponding to screened
quarks.
