  The renormalization group (RG) is used to study the asymptotically free
$\phi_6^3$-theory in curved spacetime. Several forms of the RG equations for
the effective potential are formulated. By solving these equations we obtain
the one-loop effective potential as well as its explicit forms in the case of
strong gravitational fields and strong scalar fields. Using zeta function
techniques, the one-loop and corresponding RG improved vacuum energies are
found for the Kaluza-Klein backgrounds $R^4\times S^1\times S^1$ and $R^4\times
S^2$. They are given in terms of exponentially convergent series, appropriate
for numerical calculations. A study of these vacuum energies as a function of
compactification lengths and other couplings shows that spontaneous
compactification can be qualitatively different when the RG improved energy is
used.
