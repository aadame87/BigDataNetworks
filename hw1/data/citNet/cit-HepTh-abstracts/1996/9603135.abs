  The issues that arise when using the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism in
multi-field theories are investigated. Particular attention is devoted to the
interplay between temperature effects, ultraviolet structure, and the
interdependence of the gap equations. Results are presented explicitly in the
case of the evaluation of the finite temperature effective potential of a
theory with two scalar fields which has attracted interest as a toy model for
symmetry nonrestoration at high temperatures. The lowest nontrivial order of
approximation of the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective potential is shown to
lead to consistent results, which are relevant for recent studies of symmetry
nonrestoration by Bimonte and Lozano.
