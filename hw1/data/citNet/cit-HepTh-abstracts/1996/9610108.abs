  These two lectures give a pedagogical introduction to the ``string-inspired''
worldline technique for perturbative calculations in quantum field theory. This
includes an overview over the present range of its applications. Several
examples are calculated in detail, up to the three-loop level. The emphasis is
on photon scattering in quantum electrodynamics.
