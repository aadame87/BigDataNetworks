  We present a detailed account of the isomonodromic quantization of
dimensionally reduced Einstein gravity with two commuting Killing vectors. This
theory constitutes an integrable ``midi-superspace" version of quantum gravity
with infinitely many interacting physical degrees of freedom. The canonical
treatment is based on the complete separation of variables in the isomonodromic
sectors of the model. The Wheeler-DeWitt and diffeomorphism constraints are
thereby reduced to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for $SL(2,R)$. The
physical states are shown to live in a well defined Hilbert space and are
manifestly invariant under the full diffeomorphism group. An infinite set of
independent observables \`a la Dirac exists both at the classical and the
quantum level. Using the discrete unitary representations of $SL(2,R)$, we
construct explicit quantum states. However, satisfying the additional
constraints associated with the coset space $SL(2,R)/SO(2)$ requires solutions
based on the principal series representations, which are not yet known. We
briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for string theory.
