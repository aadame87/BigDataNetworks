  A while ago, examples of N=1 vacua in D=6 were constructed as orientifolds of
Type IIB string theory compactified on the K3 surface. Among the interesting
features of those models was the presence of D5-branes behaving like small
instantons, and the appearance of extra tensor multiplets. These are both
non-perturbative phenomena from the point of view of heterotic string theory.
Although the orientifold models are a natural setting in which to study these
non-perturbative Heterotic string phenomena, it is interesting and instructive
to explore how such vacua are realised in Heterotic string theory, M-theory and
F-theory, and consider the relations between them. In particular, we consider
models of M-theory compactified on K3 x S^1/Z_2 with fivebranes present on the
interval. There is a family of such models which yields the same spectra as a
subfamily of the orientifold models. By further compactifying on T^2 to four
dimensions we relate them to Heterotic string spectra. We then use
Heterotic/Type IIA duality to deduce the existence of Calabi-Yau 3-folds which
should yield the original six dimensional orientifold spectra if we use them to
compactify F-theory. Finally, we show in detail how to take a limit of such an
F-theory compactification which returns us to the Type IIB orientifold models.
