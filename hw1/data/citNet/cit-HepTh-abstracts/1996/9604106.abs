  We prove the uncertainty relation $T_{\triangle V}\triangle
m\stackrel{>}{\sim }2\pi \hbar /c^2,$ which is realized on a statistical
mechanical level for an ensemble of events in $(1+D)$-dimensional spacetime
with motion parametrized by an invariant ``proper time'' $\tau ,$ where
$T_{\triangle V}$ is the average passage interval in $\tau $ for the events
which pass through a small (typical) $(1+D)$-volume $\triangle V,$ and
$\triangle m$ is the dispersion of mass around its on-shell value in such an
ensemble. We show that a linear mass spectrum is a completely general property
of a $(1+D)$-dimensional off-shell theory.
