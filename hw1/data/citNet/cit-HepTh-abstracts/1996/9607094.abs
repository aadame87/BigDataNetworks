Title: The Mathematical Footing of Non-associative Geometry
Authors: Raimar Wulkenhaar
Comments: 39 pages, LaTeX2e + AMS macros, revised version: modified definition
  of an ideal, because the old definition leads to a vanishing Higgs potential
  in the standard model (hep-th/9607096)

  Starting with a Hilbert space endowed with a representation of a unitary Lie
algebra and an action of a generalized Dirac operator, we develop a
mathematical concept towards gauge field theories. This concept shares common
features with the non--commutative geometry a la Connes/Lott, differs from
that, however, by the implementation of unitary Lie algebras instead of
associative *-algebras. The general scheme is presented in detail and is
applied to functions $\otimes$ matrices.
