Title: Mini-Instantons in SU(2) Gauge Theory
Authors: Vincenzo Branchina and Janos Polonyi
Comments: 10 pg
\\
  The effects of instantons close to the cut-off is studied in four dimensional
SU(2) gauge theory with higher order derivative terms in the action. It is
found in the framework of the dilute instanton gas approximation that the
convergence of the topological observables requires non-universal beta
function.
