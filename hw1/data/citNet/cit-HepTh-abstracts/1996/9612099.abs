  We review and summarize recent works on the relation between form factors in
integrable quantum field theory and deformation of geometrical data associated
to hyper-elliptic curves. This relation, which is based on a deformation of the
Riemann bilinear identity, in particular leads to the notion of null vectors in
integrable field theory and to a new description of the KdV hierarchy.
