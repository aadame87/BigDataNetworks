  We consider a recently proposed approach to bosonization in which the
original fermionic partition function is expressed as a product of a
$G/G$-coset model and a bosonic piece that contains the dynamics. In particular
we show how the method works when topological backgrounds are taken into
account. We also discuss the application of this technique to the case of
massive fermions.
