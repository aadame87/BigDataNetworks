  We show that the gauge-fermion interaction in multiflavour
$(2+1)$-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with a finite infrared cut-off is
responsible for non-fermi liquid behaviour in the infrared, in the sense of
leading to the existence of a non-trivial fixed point at zero momentum, as well
as to a significant slowing down of the running of the coupling at intermediate
scales as compared with previous analyses on the subject. Both these features
constitute deviations from fermi-liquid theory. Our discussion is based on the
leading- $1/N$ resummed solution for the wave-function renormalization of the
Schwinger-Dyson equations . The present work completes and confirms the
expectations of an earlier work by two of the authors (I.J.R.A. and N.E.M.) on
the non-trivial infrared structure of the theory.
