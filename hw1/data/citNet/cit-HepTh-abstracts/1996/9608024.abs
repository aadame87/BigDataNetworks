  We study the behavior of D-branes at distances far shorter than the string
length scale~$l_s$. We argue that short-distance phenomena are described by the
IR behavior of the D-brane world-volume quantum theory. This description is
valid until the brane motion becomes relativistic. At weak string coupling
$\gs$ this corresponds to momenta and energies far above string scale. We use
0-brane quantum mechanics to study 0-brane collisions and find structure at
length scales corresponding to the eleven-dimensional Planck length ($\lp11
\sim \gs^{1/3} l_s$) and to the radius of the eleventh dimension in M-theory
($\R11 \sim \gs l_s$). We use 0-branes to probe non-trivial geometries and
topologies at sub-stringy scales. We study the 0-brane 4-brane system,
calculating the 0-brane moduli space metric, and find the bound state at
threshold, which has characteristic size $\lp11$. We examine the blowup of an
orbifold and are able to resolve the resulting $S^2$ down to size $\lp11$. A
0-brane with momentum approaching $1/\R11$ is able to explore a larger
configuration space in which the blowup is embedded. Analogous phenomena occur
for small instantons. We finally turn to 1-branes and calculate the size of a
bound state to be $\sim \gs^{1/2} l_s$, the 1-brane tension scale.
