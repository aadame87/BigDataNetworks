  We calculate the partition function, average occupation number and internal
energy for a $SU_q(2)$ fermionic system and compare this model at $T=0$ with
the ordinary fermionic, $q=1$, case. At low temperatures and $q\gg 1$ we find
the chemical potential $\mu$ to have the same temperature dependence than the
Fermi case. For $q\ll 1$, the function $\mu(T)$ has in addition a linear
dependence on $T$.
