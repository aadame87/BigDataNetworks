  The theory including interaction between Siegel and gauge multiplets leads to
the model of nonbreaking supersymmetry which contains massive scalar,
four component fermion and gauge fields. The upper bound of Higgs boson mass is
estimated as heaviest fermion mass. The idea to replace Higgs field by scalar
superpartner or by auxiliary fields of corresponding supermultiplet is
discussed.
