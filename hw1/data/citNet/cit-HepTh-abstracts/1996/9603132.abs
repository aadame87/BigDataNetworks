Title: Generalized Fractional Statistics
Authors: G. Kaniadakis, A. Lavagno and P. Quarati
Comments: 4 pages, RevTex
\\
  We link, by means of a semiclassical approach, the fractional statistics of
particles obeying the Haldane exclusion principle to the Tsallis statistics and
derive a generalized quantum entropy and its associated statistics.
