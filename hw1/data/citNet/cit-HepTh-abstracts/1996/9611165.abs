  We study toroidal compactifications of Type II string theory with D-branes
and nontrivial antisymmetric tensor moduli and show that turning on these
fields modifies the supersymmetry projections imposed by D-branes. These
modifications are seen to be necessary for the consistency of T-duality. We
also show the existence of unusual BPS configurations of branes at angles that
are supersymmetric because of conspiracies between moduli fields. Analysis of
the problem from the point of view of the effective field theory of massless
modes shows that the presence of a 2-form background must modify the
realization of supersymmetry on the brane. In particular, the appropriate
supersymmetry variation of the physical gaugino vanishes in any constant field
strength background. These considerations are relevant for the $E_7$-symmetric
counting of states of 4-dimensional black holes in Type II string theory
compactified on $T^6$.
