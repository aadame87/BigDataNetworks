Title: Quantum Cohomology And All That

  We found a quantum cohomology/homology of quantum Hall effect which arises as
the invariant property of the Chern-Simons theory of quantum Hall effect and
showed that it should be equivalent to the quantum cohomology which arose as
the invariant property of topological sigma models. This isomorphism should be
related with an equivalence between the supersymmetric- and quantization
structures in two dimensional models and/or with an equivalence between
topological sigma models and the Chern-Simons theory by the methode of master
equation.
