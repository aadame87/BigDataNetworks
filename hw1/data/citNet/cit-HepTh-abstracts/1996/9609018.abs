  We consider a four-fermion theory as a simple model of dynamical symmetry
breaking in flat space with non-trivial topology, motivated from recent studies
in similar considerations in curved space. The phase structure is investigated,
by developing a useful formalism to evaluate the effective potential in
arbitrary compactified flat space in 3- and 4-dimensional spacetime. The phase
structure is significantly altered due to the finite volume effect in the
compactified space. Interestingly, the effect works in different way depending
on the boundary condition of the fermion fields. The physical interpretation of
the results and its implication on the dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon
in curved space are discussed.
