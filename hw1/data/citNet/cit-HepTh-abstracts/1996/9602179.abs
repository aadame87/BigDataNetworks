  Non--Abelian duality in relation to supersymmetry is examined. When the
action of the isometry group on the complex structures is non--trivial,
extended supersymmetry is realized non--locally after duality, using path
ordered Wilson lines. Prototype examples considered in detail are,
hyper--Kahler metrics with SO(3) isometry and supersymmetric WZW models. For
the latter, the natural objects in the non--local realizations of supersymmetry
arising after duality are the classical non--Abelian parafermions. The
canonical equivalence of WZW models and their non--Abelian duals with respect
to a vector subgroup is also established.
