  The quantum consistency of sigma-models describing the dynamics of extended
objects in a curved background requires the cancellation of their world-volume
anomalies, which are conformal anomalies for the heterotic string and $SO(1,5)$
Lorentz-anomalies for the heterotic five-brane, and of their ten dimensional
target space anomalies. In determining these anomalies in a $D=10$
Lorentz-covariant back-ground gauge we find that for the heterotic string the
worldvolume anomalies cancel for 32 heterotic fermions while for the
conjectured heterotic five-brane they cancel for only 16 heterotic fermions,
this result being in contrast with the string/five-brane duality conjecture.
For what concerns the target space anomalies we find that the five-brane
eight-form Lorentz-anomaly polynomial differs by a factor of $1/2$ from what
is expected on the basis of duality. Possible implications of these results are
discussed.
