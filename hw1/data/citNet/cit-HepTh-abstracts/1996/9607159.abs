  I review the appearence of integrable structures in the formulation of exact
nonperturbative solutions to $4d$ supersymmetric quantum gauge theories.
Various examples of ${\cal N}\geq 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills nonperturbative solutions
are adequately described in terms of the (deformations of the) finite-gap
solutions to integrable models: through the generating differential and the
$\tau$-function. One of the basic definitions of generating differential is
discussed and its role in the theory of integrable systems is demonstrated.
