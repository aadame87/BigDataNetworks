  We discuss the known microscopic interpretations of the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy for configurations of intersecting M-branes. In some cases the entropy
scales as that of a massless field theory on the intersection. A different
situation, found for configurations which reduce to 1-charge D=5 black holes or
2-charge D=4 black holes, is explained by a gas of non-critical strings at
their Hagedorn temperature. We further suggest that the entropy of
configurations reducing to 1-charge D=4 black holes is due to 3-branes moving
within 5-branes.
