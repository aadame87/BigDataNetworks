  Conventional weak-coupling perturbation theory suffers from problems that
arise from resonant coupling of successive orders in the perturbation series.
Multiple-scale perturbation theory avoids such problems by implicitly
performing an infinite reordering and resummation of the conventional
perturbation series. Multiple-scale analysis provides a good description of the
classical anharmonic oscillator. Here, it is extended to study the Heisenberg
operator equations of motion for the quantum anharmonic oscillator. The
analysis yields a system of nonlinear operator differential equations, which is
solved exactly. The solution provides an operator mass renormalization of the
theory.
