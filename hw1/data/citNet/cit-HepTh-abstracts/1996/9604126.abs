  The behaviour of solitons in integrable theories is strongly constrained by
the integrability of the theory; i.e. by the existence of an infinite number of
conserved quantities which these theories are known to possess. One usually
expects the scattering of solitons in such theories to be rather simple, i.e.
trivial. By contrast, in this paper we generate new soliton solutions for the
planar integrable chiral model whose scattering properties are highly
nontrivial; more precisely, in head-on collisions of $N$ indistinguishable
solitons the scattering angle (of the emerging structures relative to the
incoming ones) is $\pi/N$. We also generate soliton-antisoliton solutions with
elastic scattering; in particular, a head-on collision of a soliton and an
antisoliton resulting in $90^0$ scattering.
