  We study supersymmetric Sp(2N) gauge theories with matter in the
antisymmetric tensor representation and F fundamentals. For F=6 we solve the
theory exactly in terms of confined degrees of freedom and a superpotential. By
adding mass terms we obtain the theories with F<6 which we find to exhibit a
host of interesting non-perturbative phenomena: quantum deformed moduli spaces
with N constraints, instanton-induced superpotentials and non-equivalent
disjoint branches of moduli spaces. We find a simple dual for F=8 and no
superpotential. We show how the F=4 and F=2 theories can be modified to break
supersymmetry spontaneously and point out that the Sp(6) theory with F=6 may be
very interesting for model builders.
