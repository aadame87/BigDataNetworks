  If the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) is formulated with a cutoff that
breaks gauge invariance, then gauge invariance may be recovered only once the
cutoff is removed and only once a set of effective Ward identities is imposed.
We show that an effective Quantum Action Principle can be formulated in
perturbation theory which enables the effective Ward identities to be solved
order by order, even if the theory requires non-vanishing subtraction points.
The difficulties encountered with non-perturbative approximations are briefly
discussed.
