  We make some comments on the renormalization of Wilson operators (not just
vacuum -expectation values of Wilson operators), and the features which arise
in Minkowski space. If the Wilson loop contains a straight light-like segment,
charge renormalization does not work in a simple graph-by-graph way; but does
work when certain graphs are added together. We also verify that, in a simple
example of a smooth loop in Minkowski space, the existence of pairs of points
which are light-like separated does not cause any extra divergences.
