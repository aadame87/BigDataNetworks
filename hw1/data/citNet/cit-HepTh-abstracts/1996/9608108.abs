  Recently Das and Mathur found that the leading order Hawking emission rate of
neutral scalars by near-extremal $D=5$ black holes is exactly reproduced by a
string theoretic model involving intersecting D-branes. We show that the
agreement continues to hold for charged scalar emission. We further show that
similar agreement can be obtained for a class of near-extremal $D=4$ black
holes using a model inspired by M-theory. In this model, BPS saturated $D=4$
black holes with four charges are realized in M-theory as 5-branes triply
intersecting over a string. The low-energy excitations are signals traveling on
the intersection string.
