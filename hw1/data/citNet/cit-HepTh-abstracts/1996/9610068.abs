  We show that extreme and nonextreme Reissner--Nordstrom black holes in five
dimensions can be described by closed fundamental strings with two charges in a
magnetic five brane. Due to the five brane background the string oscillator
number and tension are rescaled whereas the mass remains fixed. The black hole
mass is given by the sum of the five brane and string masses. Its entropy
however is given by only that of the string with the tension rescaling taken
into account. We also show that the emission of a low energy scalar from the
slightly nonextreme string matches the Hawking radiation expected from the
black hole.
