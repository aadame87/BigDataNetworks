  Our aim is to give a self-contained review of recent advances in the
analytic description of the deconfinement transition and determination of the
deconfinement temperature in lattice QCD at large N. We also include some new
results, as for instance in the comparison of the analytic results with
Montecarlo simulations. We first review the general set-up of finite
temperature lattice gauge theories, using asymmetric lattices, and develop a
consistent perturbative expansion in the coupling $\beta_s$ of the space-like
plaquettes. We study in detail the effective models for the Polyakov loop
obtained, in the zeroth order approximation in $\beta_s$, both from the
Wilson action (symmetric lattice) and from the heat kernel action (completely
asymmetric lattice). The distinctive feature of the heat kernel model is its
relation with two-dimensional QCD on a cylinder; the Wilson model, on the
other hand, can be exactly reduced to a twisted one-plaquette model via a
procedure of the Eguchi-Kawai type. In the weak coupling regime both models
can be related to exactly solvable Kazakov-Migdal matrix models. The
instability of the weak coupling solution is due in both cases to a
condensation of instantons; in the heat kernel case, it is directly related
to the Douglas-Kazakov transition of QCD2. A detailed analysis of these
results provides rather accurate predictions of the deconfinement
temperature. In spite of the zeroth order approximation they are in good
agreement with the Montecarlo simulations in 2+1 dimensions, while in 3+1
dimensions they only agree with the Montecarlo results away from the
continuum limit.
