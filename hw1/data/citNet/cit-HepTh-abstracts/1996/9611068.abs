  We find a mapping between antisymmetric tensor matter fields and the
Weinberg's 2(2j+1)- component "bispinor" fields. Equations which describe the
j=1 antisymmetric tensor field coincide with the Hammer-Tucker equations
entirely and with the Weinberg ones within a subsidiary condition, the
Klein-Gordon equation. The new Lagrangian for the Weinberg theory is proposed
which is scalar and Hermitian. It is built on the basis of the concept of the
`Weinberg doubles'. Origins of a contradiction between the classical theory,
the Weinberg theorem B-A=\lambda for quantum relativistic fields and the
claimed `longitudity' of the antisymmetric tensor field (transformed on the
(1,0)\oplus (0,1) Lorentz group representation) after quantization are
clarified. Analogs of the j=1/2 Feynman-Dyson propagator are presented in the
framework of the j=1 Weinberg theory. It is then shown that under the definite
choice of field functions and initial and boundary conditions the massless j=1
Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer equations contain all information that the Maxwell
equations for electromagnetic field have. Thus, the former appear to be of use
in describing some physical processes for which that could be necessitated or
be convenient.
