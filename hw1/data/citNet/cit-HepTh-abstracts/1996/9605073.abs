  We study the ``ordinary'' Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction of the bosonic
sector of the low energy effective action of a hypothetical M-theory on $S^1
\times S^1 \cong T^2$. We thus obtain the low energy effective actions of type
IIA string theory in both ten and nine space-time dimensions. We point out how
to obtain the O(1, 1) invariance of the NS-NS sector of the string effective
action correctly in nine dimensions. We dimensionally reduce the type IIB
string effective action on $S^1$ and show that the resulting nine dimensional
theory can be mapped, purely from the bosonic consideration, exactly to the
type IIA theory by an O(1, 1) or Buscher's T-duality transformations. We then
give a dynamical argument, in analogy with that for the type IIB theory in ten
dimensions, to show how an S-duality in the type IIA theory can be understood
from the underlying nine dimensional theory by compactifying M-theory on a
T-dual torus $\tilde {T}^2$.
