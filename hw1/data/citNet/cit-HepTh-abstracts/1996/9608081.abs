  It is pointed out that there are gauge-dependent and gauge-independent
spinors within the little-group framework for internal space-time symmetries of
massless particles. It is shown that two of the $SL(2,c)$ spinors are invariant
under gauge transformations while the remaining two are not. The Dirac equation
contains only the gauge-invariant spinors leading to polarized neutrinos. It is
shown that the gauge-dependent $SL(2,c)$ spinor is the origin of the gauge
dependence of electromagnetic four-potentials.
