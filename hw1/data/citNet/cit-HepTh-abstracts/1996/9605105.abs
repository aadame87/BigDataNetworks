  We spell out the derivation of novel features, put forward earlier in a
letter, of two dimensional gravity in the strong coupling regime, at $C_L=7$,
$13$, $19$. Within the operator approach previously developed,
they neatly follow from the appearence of a new cosmological term/marginal
operator, different from the standard weak-coupling one, that determines the
world sheet interaction. The corresponding string susceptibility is obtained
and found real contrary to the continuation of the KPZ formula. Strongly
coupled (topological like) models---only involving zero-mode degrees of
freedom---are solved up to sixth order, using the ward identities which follow
from the dependence upon the new cosmological constant. They are technically
similar to the weakly coupled ones, which reproduce the matrix model results,
but gravity and matter quantum numbers are entangled differently.
