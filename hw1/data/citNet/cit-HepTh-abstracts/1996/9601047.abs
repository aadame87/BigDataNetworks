  We extend the discussion of projective group representations in quaternionic
Hilbert space which was given in our recent book. The associativity condition
for quaternionic projective representations is formulated in terms of unitary
operators and then analyzed in terms of their generator structure. The
multi--centrality and centrality assumptions are also analyzed in generator
terms, and implications of this analysis are discussed.
