  The cohomology of the BRS operator corresponding to a group of rigid
symmetries is studied in a space of local field functionals subjected to a
condition of gauge invariance. We propose a procedure based on a filtration
operator counting the degree in the infinitesimal parameters of the rigid
symmetry transformations. An application to Witten's topological Yang-Mills
theory is given.
