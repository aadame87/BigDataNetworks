  Supersymmetric monopoles of the heterotic string theory associated with
arbitrary non-negative number of the left moving modes of the string states are
presented. They include H monopoles and their T dual partners F monopoles (ALE
instantons). Massive F = H monopoles are T self-dual. Solutions include also an
infinite tower of generic T duality covariant non-singular in stringy frame
F\&H monopoles with the bottomless throat geometry. The massless F = -H
monopoles are invariant under combined T duality and charge conjugation
converting a monopole into anti monopole. All F\&H monopoles can be promoted to
the exact supersymmetric solutions of the heterotic string theory since the
holonomy group is the compact $SO(9)$. The sigma models for ${\bf M}^8$
monopoles, which admit constant complex structures, have enhanced world-sheet
supersymmetry: (4,1) in general and (4,4) for the left-right symmetric
monopoles. The space-time supersymmetric GS light-cone action in monopole
background is directly convertible into the world-sheet supersymmetric NSR
action.
