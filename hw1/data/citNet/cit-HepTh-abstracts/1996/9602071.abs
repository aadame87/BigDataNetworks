  We formulate boundary conditions for an open membrane that ends on the
fivebrane of {\cal M}-theory. We show that the dynamics of the
eleven-dimensional fivebrane can be obtained from the quantization of a ``small
membrane'' that is confined to a single fivebrane and which moves with the
speed of light. This shows that the eleven-dimensional fivebrane has an
interpretation as a $D$-brane of an open supermembrane as has recently been
proposed by Strominger and Townsend. We briefly discuss the boundary dynamics
of an infinitely extended planar membrane that is stretched between two
parallel fivebranes
