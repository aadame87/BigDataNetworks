  The present paper proposes a basis for new gravitational mechanics. The
problem of finding the spectrum of mass-energy is reduced to a new kind of
eigenvalue problem which intrinsically contains the fundamental length ${\it l}
= \sqrt{Gh\over c^3}$.The new wave equations are difference wave equations in
one representation of the theory.
