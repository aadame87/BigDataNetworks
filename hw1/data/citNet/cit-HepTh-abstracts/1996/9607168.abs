  From the equivalence of the bosonic and fermionic representations of
finitized characters in conformal field theory, one can extract mathematical
objects known as Bailey pairs. Recently Berkovich, McCoy and Schilling have
constructed a `generalized' character formula depending on two parameters $\ra$
and $\r2$, using the Bailey pairs of the unitary model $M(p-1,p)$. By taking
appropriate limits of these parameters, they were able to obtain the characters
of model $M(p,p+1)$, $N=1$ model $SM(p,p+2)$, and the unitary $N=2$ model with
central charge $c=3(1-{\frac{2}{p}})$. In this letter we computed the effective
central charge associated with this `generalized' character formula using a
saddle point method. The result is a simple expression in dilogarithms which
interpolates between the central charges of these unitary models.
