  We consider a simple model of d families of scalar field interacting with
geometry in two dimensions. The geometry is locally flat and has only global
degrees of freedom. When d<0 the universe is locally two dimensional but for
d>0 it collapses to a one dimensional manifold. The model has some, but not
all, of the characteristics believed to be features of the full theory of
conformal matter interacting with quantum gravity which has local geometric
degrees of freedom.
