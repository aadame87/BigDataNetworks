  The purpose of this article is to apply the concept of the spectral triple,
the starting point for the analysis of noncommutative spaces in the sense of
A.~Connes, to the case where the algebra $\cA$ contains both bosonic and
fermionic degrees of freedom. The operator $\cD$ of the spectral triple under
consideration is the square root of the Dirac operator und thus the forms of
the generalized differential algebra constructed out of the spectral triple are
in a representation of the Lorentz group with integer spin if the form degree
is even and they are in a representation with half-integer spin if the form
degree is odd. However, we find that the 2-forms, obtained by squaring the
connection, contains exactly the components of the vector multiplet
representation of the supersymmetry algebra. This allows to construct an action
for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the framework of noncommutative
geometry.
