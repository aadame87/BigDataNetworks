  By dimensional reduction of a self dual p-form theory on some compact space,
we determine the duality generators of the gauge theory in 4 dimensions. In
this picture duality is seen as a consequence of the geometry of the compact
space. We describe the dimensional reduction of 10-dimensional self dual 4-form
Maxwell theory to give a theory in 4-dimensions with scalar, one form and two
form fields that all transform non trivially under duality.
