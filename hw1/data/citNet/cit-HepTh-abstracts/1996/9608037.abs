  The sphaleron type solution in the electroweak theory, generalized to include
the dilaton field, is examined. The solutions describe both the variarions of
Higgs and Gauge fields inside the sphaleron and the shape of the dilaton cloud
surrounding the sphaleron. Such a cloud is large and extends far outside. These
phenomena may play an important role during the baryogenesis which probably
took place in the Early Universe.
