  The Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory may be
viewed as a prediction for the infinite family of constants F_n measuring the
n-instanton contribution to the prepotential F. Here we examine the instanton
physics directly, in particular the contribution of the general self-dual
solution of topological charge n constructed by Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and
Manin (ADHM). In both the bosonic and supersymmetric cases, we determine both
the large- and short-distance behavior of all the fields in this background.
This allows us to construct the exact classical interaction between n ADHM
(super-)instantons mediated by the adjoint Higgs. We calculate the one- and
two-instanton contributions to the low-energy Seiberg-Witten effective action,
and find precise agreement with their predicted values of F_1 and F_2.
