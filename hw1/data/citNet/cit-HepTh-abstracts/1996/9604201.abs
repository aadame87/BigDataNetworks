  The violation of the Jacobi identity by the presence of magnetic charge is
accomodated by using an explicitly nonassociative theory of octonionic fields.
It is found that the dynamics of this theory is simplified if the Lagrangian
contains only dyonic charges, but certain problems in the constrained
quantisation remain. The extension of these concepts to string theory may
however resolve these difficulties.
