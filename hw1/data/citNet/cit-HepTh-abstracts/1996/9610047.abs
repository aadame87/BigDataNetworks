  Geometric quantization on a coset space $G/H$ is considered, intending to
recover Mackey's inequivalent quantizations. It is found that the inequivalent
quantizations can be obtained by adopting the symplectic 2-form which leads to
Wong's equation. The irreducible representations of $H$ which label the
inequivalent quantizations arise from Weil's theorem, which ensures a Hermitian
bundle over $G/H$ to exist.
