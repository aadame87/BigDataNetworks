  The tunneling effect of a periodic potential with an asymmetric twin barrier
per period is calculated using the instanton method. The model is derived from
the Hamiltonian of a small ferromagnetic particle in an external magnetic field
using the spin-coherent-state path integral. The instantons in two
neighbouring barriers differ and lead to different level shifts
$\triangle\epsilon_1, \triangle\epsilon_2$. We derive with Bloch theory the
energy spectrum which has formally the structure of an energy band. The
spectrum depends on both level shifts. The removal of Kramer's degeneracy by an
external magnetic field is discussed. In addition we find a new kind of
quenching of macroscopic quantum coherence which is irrelevant to Kramer's
degeneracy.
