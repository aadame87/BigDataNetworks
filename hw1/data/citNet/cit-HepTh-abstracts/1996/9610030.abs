  We study charge k SU(2) BPS monopoles which are symmetric under the cyclic
group of order k. Approximate twistor data (spectral curves and Nahm data) is
constructed using a new technique based upon a Painleve analysis of Nahm's
equation around a pole. With this data both analytical and numerical
approximate ADHMN constructions are performed to study the zeros of the Higgs
field and the monopole energy densities. The results describe, via the moduli
space approximation, a novel type of low energy k monopole scattering.
