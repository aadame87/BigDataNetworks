  A new kind of fundamental superfield is proposed, with an Ising-like
Euclidean action. Near the Planck energy it undergoes its first stage of
symmetry-breaking, and the ordered phase is assumed to support specific kinds
of topological defects. This picture leads to a low-energy Lagrangian which is
similar to that of standard physics, but there are interesting and observable
differences. For example, the cosmological constant vanishes, fermions have an
extra coupling to gravity, the gravitational interaction of W-bosons is
modified, and Higgs bosons have an unconventional equation of motion.
