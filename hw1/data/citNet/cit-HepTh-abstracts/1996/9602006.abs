  We discuss the bosonized Schwinger model in light-cone quantization, using
discretization as an infrared regulator. We consider both the light-cone
Coulomb gauge, in which all gauge freedom can be removed and a physical Hilbert
space employed, and the light-cone Weyl (temporal) gauge, in which the Hilbert
space is unphysical and a Gauss law operator is used to select a physical
subspace. We describe the different ways in which the theta vacuum is
manifested depending on this choice of gauge, and compute the theta-dependence
of the chiral condensate in each case.
