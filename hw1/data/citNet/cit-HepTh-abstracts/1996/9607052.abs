  We study the thermodynamics of open superstrings in the presence of
$p$-dimensional D-branes. We get some finite temperature dualities relating the
one-loop canonical free energy of open strings to the self-energy of D-branes
at dual temperature. For the open bosonic string the inverse dual temperature
is, as expected, the dual length under T-duality, $4\pi^{2}\alpha^{'}/\beta$.
On the contrary, for the $SO(N)$, type-I superstring the dual temperature is
given by $\beta$-duality, $2\pi^{2}\alpha^{'}/\beta$. We also study the
emergence of the Hagedorn singularity in the dual description as triggered by
the coupling of the D-brane to unphysical tachyons as well as the high
temperature limit.
