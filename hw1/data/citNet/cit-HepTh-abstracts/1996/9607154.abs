  We derive exact analytical expressions for the critical amplitudes
$A_\psi$, $A_{gap}$ in the scaling laws for the fermion condensate $<\bar
\psi \psi> = A_\psi m^{1/3} g^{2/3}$ and for the mass of the lightest state
$M_{gap} = A_{gap} m^{2/3} g^{1/3}$ in the Schwinger model with two light
flavors, $m \ll g$. $A_\psi$ and $A_{gap}$ are expressed via certain
universal amplitude ratios being calculated recently in TBA technique and the
known coefficient $A_{\psi\psi}$ in the scaling law $<\bar \psi \psi (x) \bar
\psi \psi (0)> = A_{\psi\psi} (g/x)$ at the critical point. Numerically,
$A_\psi = -0.388..., A_{gap} = 2.008...$ . The same is done for the standard
square lattice Ising model at $T = T_c$. Using recent Fateev's results, we
get $<\sigma_{lat}> = 1.058... (H_{lat}/T_c)^{1/15}$ for the magnetization
and $M_{gap} = a/\xi = 4.010... (H_{lat}/T_c)^{8/15}$ for the inverse
correlation length ($a$ is the lattice spacing). The theoretical prediction
for $<\sigma^{lat}>$ is in a perfect agreement with numerical data. Two
available numerical papers give the values of $M_{gap}$ which differ from
each other by a factor $\approx \sqrt{2}$ . The theoretical result for
$M_{gap}$ agrees with one of them.
