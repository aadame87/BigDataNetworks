  We describe the ``universal'' action for massless superfields of all
superspins in N = 1, D = 4 anti-de Sitter superspace as a gauge theory of
unconstrained superfields taking their values in the commutative algebra of
analytic functions over a one-sheeted hyperboloid in $R^{3,1}$. The action is
invariant under N = 2 supersymmetry transformations which form a closed algebra
off the mass-shell.
