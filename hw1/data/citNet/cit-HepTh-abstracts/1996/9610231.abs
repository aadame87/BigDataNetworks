  We give a simple derivation of a new formal expression for the number of
particles produced from a conformal scalar field vacuum due to the creation of
a gauge cosmic string. We find that the number of particles released in string
formation may be substantially lower than what previous estimates have
indicated. Our derivation also indicates that there always exists at least one
critical angle deficit less than $2\pi$, at which the particle production
attains a maximum value. At the end we argue that additional (quantum) effects
will occur in string formation. In particular, a new mechanism to produce small
scale structure on strings is proposed.
