  We study a class of extremal transitions between topological distinct
Calabi--Yau manifolds which have an interpretation in terms of the special
massless states of a type II string compactification. In those cases where a
dual heterotic description exists the exceptional massless states are due to
genuine strong (string-) coupling effects. A new feature is the appearance of
enhanced non-abelian gauge symmetries in the exact nonperturbative theory.
