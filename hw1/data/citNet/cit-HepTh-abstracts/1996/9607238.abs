Title: p-Brane and D-Brane Actions
Authors: E. Bergshoeff
Comments: 4 pages, latex, uses sprocl.sty; talk given at the Second
  International Sakharov Conference on Physics (Moscow, May 1996)
\\
  We consider the actions for ten--dimensional $p$--branes and $D$--branes in
an arbitrary curved background and discuss some of their properties. We comment
on how the $SL(2,R)$ duality symmetry acts on the five--brane actions.
