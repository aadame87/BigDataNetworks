  In this talk we present some links of the theory of the odderon with elliptic
curves. These results were obtained in an earlier work \cite{RJ}. The natural
degrees of freedom of the odderon turn out to coincide with conformal
invariants of elliptic curves with a fixed `sign'. This leads to a formulation
of the odderon which is modular invariant with respect to $\Gamma^2$ --- the
unique normal subgroup of \slz {\,} of index 2.
