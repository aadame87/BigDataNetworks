  We study superstrings with orientifold projections and with generalized open
string boundary conditions (D-branes). We find two types of consistency
condition, one related to the algebra of Chan-Paton factors and the other to
cancellation of divergences. One consequence is that the Dirichlet 5-branes of
the Type I theory carry a symplectic gauge group, as required by string
duality. As another application we study the Type I theory on a $K3$ $Z_2$
orbifold, finding a family of consistent theories with various unitary and
symplectic subgroups of $U(16) \times U(16)$. We argue that the $K3$ orbifold
with spin connection embedded in gauge connection corresponds to an interacting
conformal field theory in the Type I theory.
