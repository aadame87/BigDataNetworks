  We study the space-time CPT properties of string theories formulated in a
flat Minkowski background of even dimension. We define CPT as a world-sheet
transformation acting on the vertex operators and we prove the CPT invariance
of the string $S$-matrix elements. Some related issues, including the
connection between spin and statistics of physical string states, are also
considered.
