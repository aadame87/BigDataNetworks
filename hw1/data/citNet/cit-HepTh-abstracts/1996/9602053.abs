  The influence of spatial geometry on the vacuum polarization in
2+1-dimensional spinor electrodynamics is investigated. The vacuum angular
momentum induced by an external static magnetic field is found to depend on
global geometric surface characteristics connected with curvature. The
relevance of the results obtained for the fermion number fractionization is
discussed.
