  We construct multi-center solutions for charged, dilatonic, non-extremal
black holes in $D=4$. When an infinite array of such non-extremal black holes
are aligned periodically along an axis, the configuration becomes independent
of this coordinate, which can therefore be used for Kaluza-Klein
compactification. This generalises the vertical dimensional reduction procedure
to include {\it non-extremal} black holes. We then extend the construction to
multi-center non-extremal $(D-4)$-branes in $D$ dimensions, and discuss their
vertical dimensional reduction.
