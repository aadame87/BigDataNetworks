  We extend previous work on the soft breaking of $N=2$ supersymmetric QCD. We
present the formalism for the breaking due to a dilaton spurion for a general
gauge group and obtain the exact effective potential. We obtain some general
features of the vacuum structure in the pure $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory and we
also derive a general mass formula for this class of theories, in particular we
present explicit results for the mass spectrum in the $SU(2)$ case. Finally we
analyze the vacuum structure of the $SU(2)$ theory with one massless
hypermultiplet. This theory presents dyon condensation and a first order phase
transition in the supersymmetry breaking parameter driven by non-mutually local
BPS states. This could be a hint of Argyres-Douglas-like phases in
non-supersymmetric gauge theories.
