  We consider geometric engineering of N=1 supersymmetric QFTs with matter in
terms of a local model for compactification of F-theory on Calabi-Yau fourfold.
By bringing 3-branes near 7-branes we engineer N=1 supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$
gauge theory with $N_f$ flavors in the fundamental. We identify the Higgs
branch of this system with the instanton moduli space on the compact four
dimensional space of the 7-brane worldvolume. Moreover we show that the
Euclidean 3-branes wrapped around the compact part of the 7-brane worldvolume
can generate superpotential for $N_f=N_c-1$ as well as lead to quantum
corrections to the moduli space for $N_f=N_c$. Finally we argue that Seiberg's
duality for N=1 supersymmetric QCD may be mapped to T-duality exchanging
7-branes with 3-branes.
