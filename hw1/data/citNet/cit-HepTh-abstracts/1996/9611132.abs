\\
  A new form of the Wilson renormalization group equation is derived, in which
the flow equations are, up to linear terms, proportional to a gradient flow. A
set of co\"ordinates is found in which the flow of marginal, low-energy,
couplings takes a gradient form, if relevant couplings are tuned to vanish.
