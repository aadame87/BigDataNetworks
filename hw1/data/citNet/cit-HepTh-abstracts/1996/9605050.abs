  We study some properties of target space strings constructed from (2,1)
heterotic strings. We argue that world-sheet complexification is a general
property of the bosonic sector of such target world-sheets. We give a target
space interpretation of this fact and relate it to the non-gaussian nature of
free String Field Theory. We provide several one loop calculations supporting
the stringy construction of critical world-sheets in terms of (2,1) models.
Using finite temperature boundary conditions in the underlying (2,1) string we
obtain non-chiral target space spin structures, and point out some of the
problems arising for chiral spin structures, such as the heterotic world-sheet.
To this end, we study the torus partition function of the corresponding
asymmetric orbifold of the (2,1) string.
