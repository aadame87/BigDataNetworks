  We consider the type I theory compactified on $T^3$. When the D5-brane wraps
the $T^3$ it yields a D2-brane in seven dimensions. In the leading
approximation the moduli space of vacua of the three dimensional field theory
on the brane is $T^4/\ZZ_2$. The dual M theory description of this theory is a
compactification on K3 and our 2-brane is the eleven dimensional 2-brane at a
point in K3. We use this fact to conclude that strong coupling IR effects in
the three dimensional theory on the brane turn its moduli space into a K3. This
interpretation allows us to solve various strongly coupled gauge theories in
three dimensions by identifying their Coulomb branch with a piece of a
(sometime singular) K3.
