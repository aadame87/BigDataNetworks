  We study Abelian generalized deformations of the usual product of polynomials
introduced in hep-th/9602016. We construct an explicit example for the case of
$su/2$ which provides a tentative of a quantum-mechanical description
of Nambu Mechanics on $R^3$. By introducing the notions of strong and
weak triviality of generalized deformations, we show that the Zariski product
is never trivial in either sense, while the example constructed here in a
quantum-mechanical context is only strongly non-trivial.
