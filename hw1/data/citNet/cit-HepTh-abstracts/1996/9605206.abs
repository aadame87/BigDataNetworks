  We present master formulas for the divergent part of the one-loop effective
action for an arbitrary (both minimal and nonminimal) operators of any order in
the 4-dimensional curved space. They can be considered as computer algorithms,
because the one-loop calculations are then reduced to the simplest algebraic
operations. Some test applications are considered by REDUCE analytical
calculation system.
