  The theory of magnetohydrodynamics is extended to the cases of a plasma of
separate magnetic and electric charges, as well as to a plasma of dyons
respectively. In both these cases the system possesses electric-magnetic
duality symmetry. In the former case we find that because of the existence of
two independent generalized Ohm's law equations, the limit of infinite electric
and magnetic conductivity results in the vanishing of both electric and
magnetic fields, as well as the corresponding currents. In the dyonic case, we
find that the resulting duality-invariant system of equations are equivalent to
those of ordinary MHD, after suitable field redefinitions.
