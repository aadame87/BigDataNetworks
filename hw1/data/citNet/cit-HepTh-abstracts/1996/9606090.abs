  We give generalizations of extended Poincar\'e supergravity with {\it
arbitrarily many} supersymmetries in the absence of central charges in
three-dimensions by gauging its intrinsic global $~SO(N)$~ symmetry. We call
these \alephnull (Aleph-Null) supergravity theories. We further couple a
non-Abelian supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory and an Abelian topological BF
theory to \alephnull supergravity. Our result overcomes the previous difficulty
for supersymmetrization of Chern-Simons theories beyond $~N=4$. This feature is
peculiar to the Chern-Simons and BF theories including supergravity in
three-dimensions. We also show that dimensional reduction schemes for
four-dimensional theories such as $~N=1$~ self-dual supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory or $~N=1$~ supergravity theory that can generate \alephnull globally and
locally supersymmetric theories in three-dimensions. As an interesting
application, we present \alephnull supergravity Liouville theory in
two-dimensions after appropriate dimensional reduction from three-dimensions.
