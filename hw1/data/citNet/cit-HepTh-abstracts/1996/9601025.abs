\\
  It is demonstrated that quasi-exactly solvable models of quantum mechanics
admit an interesting duality transformation which changes the form of their
potentials and inverts the sign of all the exactly calculable energy levels.
This transformation helps one to reveal some new features of quasi-exactly
solvable models and associated orthogonal polynomials.
