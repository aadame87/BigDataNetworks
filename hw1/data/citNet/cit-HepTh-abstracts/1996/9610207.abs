Title: Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations as a quantization of
  nonstationary Hitchin system
Authors: D. Ivanov
Comments: 12 pages, TeX
\\
  The KZB equations for conformal blocks of the WZNW theory are written on the
moduli space of holomorphic principal bundles on the surface. They become the
multi-time Schroedinger equation for the nonstationary Hitchin system. From the
known form of the equations we learn about the covariance of quantization with
respect to changes of the coordinate frame.
