Title: On the Strong CP Problem without Axion Field
Author: Gabor Etesi
Comments: 7 pages, LaTex, no figures, the connection with the CP-problem is
  emphasized
\\
  In this letter we present a topological observation related to the CP problem
in non-Abelian gauge theories, based on significant differences between
space-times and their Wick-rotation. We point out that models containing
stationary black holes the problem of CP breaking does not appear.
