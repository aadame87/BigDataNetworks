  We consider the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in one space and one
time dimension. We are interested in the non-free-fermionic case. We consider
static temperature-dependent correlation functions. The determinant
representation for correlation functions simplifies in the small mass limit of
the Bose particle. In this limit we describe the correlation functions by the
vacuum expectation value of a boson-valued solution for Maxwell-Bloch
differential equation. We evaluate long-distance asymptotics of correlation
functions in the small mass limit.
