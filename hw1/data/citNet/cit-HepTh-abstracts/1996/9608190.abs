  We investigate (1,0)-superconformal Toda theories based on simple Lie
algebras and find that the classical integrability properties of the underlying
bosonic theories do not survive. For several models based on algebras of low
rank, we show explicitly that none of the conserved W-algebra generators can be
generalized to the supersymmetric case. Using these results we deduce that at
least one W-algebra generator fails to generalize in any model based on a
classical Lie algebra. This argument involves a method for relating the bosonic
Toda theories and their conserved currents within each classical series. We
also scrutinize claims that the (1,0)-superconformal models actually admit
(1,1) supersymmetry and find that they do not. Our results are consistent with
the belief that all integrable Toda models with fermions arise from Lie
superalgebras.
