  Within a four dimensional N = 1 superspace, we present a new ansatz for the
Skyrme term and for the gauged WZNW term embedded into a superaction. We use
the new chiral-nonminimal (CNM) formulation for the effective low-energy action
of 4D, N = 1 supersymmetric QCD constructed by assigning right-handed
components of Dirac fields to chiral multiplets and left-handed components of
Dirac fields to nonminimal multiplets. It is noted that such a construction
likely allows for a new type of parity violation in low-energy 4D, N = 1
supersymmetric QCD.
