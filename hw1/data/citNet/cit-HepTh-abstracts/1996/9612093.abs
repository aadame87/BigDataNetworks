  We summarize recent progress in the understanding of fixed point resolution
for conformal field theories. Fixed points in both coset conformal field
theories and non-diagonal modular invariants which describe simple current
extensions of chiral algebras are investigated. A crucial role is played by the
mathematical structures of twining characters and orbit Lie algebras.
