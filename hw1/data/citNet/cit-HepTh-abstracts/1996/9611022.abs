  The free field theory for Regge trajectory is described in the framework of
the BRST - quantization method. The physical spectrum includes daugther
trajectories along with parent one. The applicability of the BRST approach to
the description of a single Regge trajectory without its daughter trajectories
is discussed. The simple example illustrates the appropriately modified BRST
construction for the needed second class constraints.
