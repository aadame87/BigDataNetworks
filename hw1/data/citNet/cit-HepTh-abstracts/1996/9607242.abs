  We show that the chiral soliton model recently introduced by Aglietti et al.
can be made integrable by adding an attractive potential with a fixed
coefficient. The modified model is equivalent to the derivative nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger model which does not possess parity and Galilean invariance. We
obtain explicit one and two classical soliton solutions and show that in the
weak coupling limit, they correctly reproduce the bound state energy as well as
the time delay of two-body quantum mechanics of the model.
