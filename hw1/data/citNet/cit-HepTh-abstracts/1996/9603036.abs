Title: Physical masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field
Author: Hung Cheng and S.P. Li
Comments: Latex, 7 pages
\\
  By using the Ward-Takahashi identities in the Landau gauge, we derive exact
relations between particle masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs
field in the Abelian gauge field theory with a Higgs meson.
