  Octonionic algebra being nonassociative is difficult to manipulate. We
introduce left-right octonionic barred operators which enable us to reproduce
the associative GL(8,R) group. Extracting the basis of GL(4,C), we establish an
interesting connection between the structure of left-right octonionic barred
operators and generic 4x4 complex matrices. As an application we give an
octonionic representation of the 4-dimensional Clifford algebra.
