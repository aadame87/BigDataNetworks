  Various aspects of branes in the recently proposed matrix model for M theory
are discussed. A careful analysis of the supersymmetry algebra of the matrix
model uncovers some central charges which can be activated only in the large
$N$ limit. We identify the states with non-zero charges as branes of different
dimensions.
