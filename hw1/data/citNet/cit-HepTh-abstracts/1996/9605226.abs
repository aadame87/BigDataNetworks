  We discuss a novel method of obtaining the fractional spin of abelian and
nonabelian Chern-Simons vortices. This spin is interpreted as the difference
between the angular momentum obtained by modifying Schwinger's energy momentum
tensor by the Gauss constraint, and the canonical (Noether) angular momentum.
It is found to be a boundary term depending only on the gauge field and, hence,
is independent of the matter sector to which the Chern-Simons term couples.
Addition of the Maxwell term does not alter the fractional spin.
