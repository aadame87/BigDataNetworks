  We compute the corrections to the transition amplitudes of an accelerated
Unruh ``box'' that arise when the accelerated box is replaced by a ``two
level ion'' immersed in a constant electric field and treated in second
quantization. There are two kinds of corrections, those due to recoil effects
induced by the momentum transfers and those due to pair creation. Taken
together, these corrections show that there is a direct relationship between
pair creation amplitudes described by the Heisenberg-Euler-Schwinger
mechanism and the Unruh effect, i.e. the thermalisation of accelerated
systems at temperature $a/ 2 \pi$ where $a$ is the acceleration. In
particular, there is a thermodynamical consistency between both effects whose
origin is that the euclidean action governing pair creation rates acts as an
entropy in delivering the Unruh temperature. Upon considering pair creation
of charged black holes in an electric field, these relationships explain why
black holes are created from vacuum in thermal equilibrium, i.e. with their
Hawking temperature equal to their Unruh temperature.
