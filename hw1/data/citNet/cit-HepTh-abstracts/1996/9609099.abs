  I discuss how the basic phenomenon of asymptotic freedom in QCD can be
understood in elementary physical terms. Similarly, I discuss how the
long-predicted phenomenon of ``gluonization of the proton'' -- recently
spectacularly confirmed at HERA -- is a rather direct manifestation of the
physics of asymptotic freedom. I review the broader significance of asymptotic
freedom in QCD in fundamental physics: how on the one hand it guides the
interpretation and now even the design of experiments, and how on the other it
makes possible a rational, quantitative theoretical approach to problems of
unification and early universe cosmology.
