  The Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) treatment for the quantization of
collective coordinates is considered in the Lagrangian formalism. The motion of
a particle in a Riemannian manifold is studied in the case when the classical
solutions break a non-abelian global invariance of the action. Collective
coordinates are introduced, and the resulting gauge theory is quantized in the
BRST antifield formalism. The partition function is computed perturbatively to
two-loops, and it is shown that the results are independent of gauge-fixing
parameters.
