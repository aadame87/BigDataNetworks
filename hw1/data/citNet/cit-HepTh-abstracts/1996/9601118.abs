  We study a class of rotating dyonic black holes in the heterotic string
theory in four dimension which have left, right independent electric charges
but have same magnitude for the left and right magnetic charges. In both left
and right sector the electric and the magnetic vectors are orthogonal to each
other. The gyromagnetic(electric) ratios are in general found not to have an
upper bound.
