  We perform two-loop calculation of Chern-Simons in background field method
using the hybrid regularization of higher-covariant derivative and dimensional
regularization. It is explicitly shown that Chern-Simons field theory is finite
at the two-loop level. This finiteness plays an important role in the relation
of Chern-Simons theory with two-dimensional conformal field theory and the
description of link invariant.
