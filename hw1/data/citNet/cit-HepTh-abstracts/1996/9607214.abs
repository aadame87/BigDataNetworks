  Starting from the formal expressions of the hydrodynamical (or ``local'')
quantities employed in the applications of Clifford Algebras to quantum
mechanics, we introduce --in terms of the ordinary tensorial framework-- a new
definition for the field of a generic quantity. By translating from Clifford
into tensor algebra, we also propose a new (non-relativistic) velocity operator
for a spin 1/2 particle. This operator is the sum of the ordinary part p/m
describing the mean motion (the motion of the center-of-mass), and of a second
part associated with the so-called zitterbewegung, which is the spin
``internal'' motion observed in the center-of-mass frame. This spin component
of the velocity operator is non-zero not only in the Pauli theoretical
framework, i.e. in presence of external magnetic fields and spin precession,
but also in the Schroedinger case, when the wave-function is a spin eigenstate.
In the latter case, one gets a decomposition of the velocity field for the
Madelung fluid into two distinct parts: which constitutes the non-relativistic
analogue of the Gordon decomposition for the Dirac current. We find furthermore
that the zitterbewegung motion involves a velocity field which is solenoidal,
and that the local angular velocity is parallel to the spin vector. In presence
of a non-constant spin vector (Pauli case) we have, besides the component
normal to spin present even in the Schroedinger theory, also a component of the
local velocity which is parallel to the rotor of the spin vector.
