  We suggest and motivate a precise equivalence between uncompactified eleven
dimensional M-theory and the N = infinity limit of the supersymmetric matrix
quantum mechanics describing D0-branes. The evidence for the conjecture
consists of several correspondences between the two theories. As a consequence
of supersymmetry the simple matrix model is rich enough to describe the
properties of the entire Fock space of massless well separated particles of the
supergravity theory. In one particular kinematic situation the leading large
distance interaction of these particles is exactly described by supergravity .
The model appears to be a nonperturbative realization of the holographic
principle. The membrane states required by M-theory are contained as
excitations of the matrix model. The membrane world volume is a noncommutative
geometry embedded in a noncommutative spacetime.
