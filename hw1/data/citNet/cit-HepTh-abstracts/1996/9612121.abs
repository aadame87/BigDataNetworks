Title: Four Lectures on M-theory
Authors: P.K. Townsend
Comments: 55pp. 4 figs. Latex. Sprocl.sty macro needed. To appear in procs. of
  the ICTP summer school on High Energy Physics and Cosmology, Trieste, June
  1996. Revision includes minor corrections to some formulae and addition of a

  Synopsis: (i) how superstring theories are unified by M-theory; (ii) how
superstring and supermembrane properties follow from the D=10 and D=11
supersymmetry algebras; (iii) how D=10 and D=11 supergravity theories determine
the strong coupling limit of superstring theories; (iv) how properties of Type
II p-branes follow from those of M-branes.
