  A six-dimensional black string is considered and its Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy computed. It is shown that to leading order above extremality, this
entropy precisely counts the number of string states with the given energy and
charges. This identification implies that Hawking decay of the near-extremal
black string can be analyzed in string perturbation theory and is
perturbatively unitary.
