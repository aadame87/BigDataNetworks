  We consider several orbifold compactifications of M-theory and their
corresponding type II duals in two space-time dimensions. In particular, we
show that while the orbifold compactification of M-theory on $T^9/J_9$ is dual
to the orbifold compactification of type IIB string theory on $T^8/I_8$, the
same orbifold $T^8/I_8$ of type IIA string theory is dual to M-theory
compactified on a smooth product manifold $K3 \times T^5$. Similarly, while the
orbifold compactification of M-theory on $(K3 \times T^5)/\sigma ... J_5$ is
dual to the orbifold compactification of type IIB string theory on $(K3 \times
T^4)/\sigma ... I_4$, the same orbifold of type IIA string theory is dual to
the orbifold $T^4 \times (K3 \times S^1)/\sigma ... J_1$ of M-theory. The
spectrum of various orbifold compactifications of M-theory and type II string
theories on both sides are compared giving evidence in favor of these duality
conjectures. We also comment on a connection between Dasgupta-Mukhi-Witten
conjecture and Dabholkar-Park-Sen conjecture for the six-dimensional orbifold
models of type IIB string theory and M-theory.
