  Different group structures which underline the integrable systems are
considered. In some cases, the quantization of the integrable system can be
provided with substituting groups by their quantum counterparts. However, some
other group structures keep non-deformed in the course of quantizing the
integrable system although their treatment is to be changed. Manifest examples
of the KP/Toda hierarchy and the Liouville theory are considered.
