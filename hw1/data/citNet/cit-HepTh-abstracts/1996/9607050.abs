  The strong coupling limit of a quantum system is in general quite
complicated, but in some cases a great simplification occurs: the strongly
coupled limit is equivalent to the weakly coupled limit of some other system.
In string theory conjectures of this type go back several years, but only in
the past year and a half has it been understood to be a general principle
applying to all string theories. This has improved our understanding of string
dynamics, including quantum gravity, in many new and sometimes surprising ways.
I describe these developments and put them in the context of the search for the
unified theory of particle physics and gravity.
