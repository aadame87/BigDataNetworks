  We propose an alternative to Dirac quantization for a quadratic constrained
system. We show that this solves the Jacobi identity violation problem occuring
in the Dirac quantization case and yields a well defined Fock space. By
requiring the uniqueness of the ground state, we show that for non-constrained
systems this approach gives the same results as Dirac quantization.
