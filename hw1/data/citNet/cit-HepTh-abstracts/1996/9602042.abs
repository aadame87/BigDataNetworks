  The screening of an applied magnetic field in the charged anyon fluid at
finite density and temperature is investigated. For densities typical of
high-temperature superconducting materials we find that the anyon fluid
exhibits a superconducting behavior at any temperature. The total Meissner
screening is characterized by two penetration lengths corresponding to two
short-range eigenmodes of propagation within the anyon fluid.
