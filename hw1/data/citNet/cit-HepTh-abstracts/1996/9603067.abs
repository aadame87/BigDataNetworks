  We discuss the limitations of 't Hooft's proposal for the black hole
S-matrix. We find that the validity of the S-matrix implies violation of the
semi-classical approximation at scales large compared to the Planck scale. We
also show that the effect of the centrifugal barrier on the S-matrix is crucial
even for large transverse distances.
