  It is shown that many modes of the gravitational field exist only inside the
horizon of an extreme black hole in string theory. At least in certain cases,
the number of such modes is sufficient to account for the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy. These modes are associated with sources which carry Ramond-Ramond
charge, and so may be viewed as the strong coupling limit of D-branes. Although
these sources naturally live at the singularity, they are well defined and
generate modes which extend out to the horizon. This suggests that the
information in an extreme black hole is not localized near the singularity or
the horizon, but extends between them.
