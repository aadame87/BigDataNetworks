  The nonabelian Stokes theorem, representing a Wilson loop as an integral over
all the orientations in colour space, and the cumulant expansion are used for
derivation of the string effective action in SU(2) gluodynamics. The obtained
theory is the theory of the rigid string interacting with the rank two
antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond fields. In this model there exists a phase where
there are no problems of crumpling and wrong high temperature behaviour of the
string tension, which are present in the free rigid string theory. The Langevin
approach to stochastic quantization of the obtained theory is applied.
