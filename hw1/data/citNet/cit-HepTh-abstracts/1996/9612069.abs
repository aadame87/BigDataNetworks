  We discuss the geometry of dynamical triangulations associated with
3-dimensional and 4-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity. We provide
analytical expressions for the canonical partition function in both cases, and
study its large volume behavior. In the space of the coupling constants of the
theory, we characterize the infinite volume line and the associated critical
points. The results of this analysis are found to be in excellent agreement
with the MonteCarlo simulations of simplicial quantum gravity. In particular,
we provide an analytical proof that simply-connected dynamically triangulated
4-manifolds undergo a higher order phase transition at a value of the inverse
gravitational coupling given by 1.387, and that the nature of this transition
can be concealed by a bystable behavior. A similar analysis in the
3-dimensional case characterizes a value of the critical coupling (3.845) at
which hysteresis effects are present.
