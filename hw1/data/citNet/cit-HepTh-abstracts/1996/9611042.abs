  We consider Dirichlet p-branes in type II string theory on a space which has
been toroidally compactified in d dimensions. We give an explicit construction
of the field theory description of this system by putting a countably infinite
number of copies of each brane on the noncompact covering space, and modding
out the resulting gauge theory by Z^d. The resulting theory is a gauge theory
with graded fields corresponding to strings winding around the torus an
arbitrary number of times. In accordance with T-duality, this theory is
equivalent to the gauge theory for the dual system of (d + p)-branes wrapped
around the compact directions, where the winding number is exchanged for
momentum in the compact direction.
