  Studies in string theory and in quantum gravity suggest the existence of a
finite lower bound to the possible resolution of lengths which, quantum
theoretically, takes the form of a minimal uncertainty in positions $\Delta
x_0$. A finite minimal uncertainty in momenta $\Delta p_0$ has been motivated
from the absence of plane waves on generic curved spaces. Both effects can be
described as small noncommutative geometric features of space-time. In a path
integral approach to the formulation of field theories on noncommutative
geometries, we can now generally prove IR regularisation for the case of
noncommutative geometries which imply minimal uncertainties $\Delta p_0$ in
momenta.
