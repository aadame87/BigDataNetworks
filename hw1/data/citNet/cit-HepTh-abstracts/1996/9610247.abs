  We study the nonrelativistic limit of the quantum theory of a real scalar
field with quartic self-interaction. The two body scattering amplitude is
written in such way as to separate the contributions of high and low energy
intermediary states. From this result and the two loop computation of the self
energy correction, we determine an effective nonrelativistic action.
