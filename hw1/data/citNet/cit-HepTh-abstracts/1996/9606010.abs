  Type II superstring theory with mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions admit antisymmetric tensors with varying degrees in the spectrum. We
show that there exists a family of dual supergravity lagrangians to the $N=2$
type IIA action in ten dimensions. The duality transformations and the
resulting actions are constructed explicitely.
