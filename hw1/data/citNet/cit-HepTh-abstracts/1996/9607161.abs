  The main definitions and properties of Lie superalgebras are proposed a la
facon de a short dictionary, the different items following the alphabetical
order. The main topics deal with the structure of simple Lie superalgebras and
their finite dimensional representations; rather naturally, a few pages are
devoted to supersymmetry. This modest booklet has two ambitious goals: to be
elementary and easy to use. The beginner is supposed to find out here the main
concepts on superalgebras, while a more experimented theorist should recognize
the necessary tools and informations for a specific use.
