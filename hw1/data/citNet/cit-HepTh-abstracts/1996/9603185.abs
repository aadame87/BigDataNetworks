  The scattering problem under the influence of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB)
potential is reconsidered. By solving the Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation we
obtain the wave function of the scattering state in this system. In spite of
working with a plane wave as an incident wave we obtain the same wave function
as was given by Aharonov and Bohm. Another method to solve the scattering
problem is given by making use of a modified version of Gordon's idea which was
invented to consider the scattering by the Coulomb potential. These two methods
give the same result, which guarantees the validity of taking an incident plane
wave as usual to make an analysis of this scattering problem. The scattering
problem by a solenoid of finite radius is also discussed, and we find that the
vector potential of the solenoid affects the charged particles even when the
magnitude of the flux is an odd integer as well as noninteger. It is shown that
the unitarity of the $S$ matrix holds provided that a plane wave is taken to be
an incident one.
