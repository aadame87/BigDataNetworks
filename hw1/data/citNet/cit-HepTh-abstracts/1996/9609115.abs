  Super--inflation driven by dilaton/moduli kinetic energy is naturally
realized in compactified string theory. Discussed are selected topics of recent
development in string inflationary cosmology: kinematics of super-inflation,
graceful exit triggered by quantum back reaction, and clasical and quantum
power spectra of density and metric perturbations.
