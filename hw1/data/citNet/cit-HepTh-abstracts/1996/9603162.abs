  We analyze free-fermion conditions on vertex models. We show --by examining
examples of vertex models on square, triangular, and cubic lattices-- how they
amount to degeneration conditions for known symmetries of the Boltzmann
weights, and propose a general scheme for such a process in two and more
dimensions.
