  We study the correspondence between IIb solitonic 1-branes and monopoles in
the context of the 3-brane realization of $D=4$ $N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.
We show that a bound state of 1-branes stretching between two separated
3-branes exhibits a family of super-symmetric ground states that can be
identified with the ADHMN construction of the moduli space of $SU(2)$
monopoles.. This identification is supported by the construction of the
monopole gauge field as a space-time coupling in the quantum mechanical
effective action of a 1-brane used as a probe. The analysis also reveals an
intriguing aspect of the 1-brane theory:the transverse oscillations of the
1-branes in the ground states are described by non-commuting matrix valued
fields which develop poles at the boundary. Finally, the construction is
generalized to $SU(n)$ monopoles with arbitrary $n>2$.
