  Asymptotic states in field theories containing non-local kinetic terms are
analyzed using the canonical method, naturally defined in Minkowski space. We
apply our results to study the asymptotic states of a non-local
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory coming from bosonization in 2+1 dimensions. We
show that in this case the only asymptotic state of the theory, in the trivial
(non-topological) sector, is the vacuum.
