  All global solutions of arbitrary topology of the most general 1+1
dimensional dilaton gravity models are obtained. We show that for a generic
model there are globally smooth solutions on any non-compact 2-surface. The
solution space is parametrized explicitly and the geometrical significance of
continuous and discrete labels is elucidated. As a corollary we gain insight
into the (in general non-trivial) topology of the reduced phase space.
 The classification covers basically all 2D metrics of Lorentzian signature
with a (local) Killing symmetry.
