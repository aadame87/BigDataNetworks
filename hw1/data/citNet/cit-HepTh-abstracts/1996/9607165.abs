  We describe several infinite series of rational conformal field theories
whose conformal characters are modular units, i.e. which are modular functions
having no zeros or poles in the upper complex half plane, and which thus
possess simple product expansions. We conjecture that certain infinite series
of rational models of Casimir W-algebras always have this property.
Furthermore, we describe an algorithm which can be used to prove whether a
modular function is a modular unit or not.
