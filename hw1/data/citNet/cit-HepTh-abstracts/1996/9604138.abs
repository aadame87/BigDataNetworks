  We find the spectrum of magnetic monopoles produced in the symmetry breaking
SU(5) to [SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)']/Z_6 by constructing classical bound
states of the fundamental monopoles. The spectrum of monopoles is found to
correspond to the spectrum of one family of standard model fermions and hence,
is a starting point for constructing the dual standard model. At this level,
however, there is an extra monopole state - the ``diquark'' monopole - with no
corresponding standard model fermion. If the SU(3) factor now breaks down to
Z_3, the monopoles with non-trivial SU(3) charge get confined by strings in
SU(3) singlets. Another outcome of this symmetry breaking is that the diquark
monopole becomes unstable (metastable) to fragmentation into fundamental
monopoles and the one-one correspondence with the standard model fermions is
restored. We discuss the fate of the monopoles if the [SU(2)\times U(1)']/Z_2
factor breaks down to U(1)_Q by a Higgs mechanism as in the electroweak model.
Here we find that monopoles that are misaligned with the vacuum get connected
by strings even though the electroweak symmetry breaking does not admit
topological strings. We discuss the lowest order quantum corrections to the
mass spectrum of monopoles.
