  The formalism, which permits to study the phase structure of gauged NJL-model
for arbitrary external fields, is developed. The effective potential in the
gauged NJL model in the weak magnetic field is found. It is shown that in fixed
gauge coupling case the weak magnetic field doesn't influence chiral symmetry
breaking condition. The analogy with the situation near black hole is briefly
mentioned.
