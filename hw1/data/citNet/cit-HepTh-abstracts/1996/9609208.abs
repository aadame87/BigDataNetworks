Title: Unique Deformation of Local Quantum Field Theory Resulting in
  Divergence-free Amplitudes
Author: G.H. Gadiyar
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  An essentially unique deformation of the product of quantum fields at the
same spacetime point is obtained. It is proposed to replace local quantum field
theory with another structure which uses a *-product. The resulting theory
contains a fundamental length and is free from divergences. This provides the
third deformation suggested by Faddeev.
