  A projection (gauge) independent formulation of the monopole dominance,
discovered in lattice QCD for the maximal abelian projection, is given. A new
dynamical abelian projection of continuum QCD, which does not rely on any
explicit gauge condition imposed on gauge fields, is proposed. Under the
assumption that the results of numerical simulations holds in the continuum
limit, the monopole dominance is proved for the dynamical abelian projection.
The latter enables us to develop an effective scalar field theory for dominant
(monopole) configurations of gauge fields. The approach is manifestly gauge and
Lorentz invariant.
