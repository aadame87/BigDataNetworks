Title: Discrete Hirota's equation in quantum integrable models

\\
  The recent progress in revealing classical integrable structures in quantum
models solved by Bethe ansatz is reviewed. Fusion relations for eigenvalues of
quantum transfer matrices can be written in the form of classical Hirota's
bilinear difference equation. This equation is also known as the completely
discretized version of the 2D Toda lattice. We explain how one obtains the
specific quantum results by solving the classical equation. The auxiliary
linear problem for the Hirota equation is shown to generalize Baxter's T-Q
relation.
