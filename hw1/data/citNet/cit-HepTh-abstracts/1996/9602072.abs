  We show via use of the RADIO technique that an off-shell (4,0) version of the
hypermultiplet, in the form first proposed by Fayet, exists and contains 28 -
28 component fields. The off-shell structure uncovered is found to include a
chiral truncation of the ``generalized 2D, N = 4 tensor multiplet formalism''
proposed by Ketov. The (4,0) theory is extended to an off-shell 56 - 56
component field (4,4) theory with the addition of a minimal (4,0) minus spinor
multiplet together with (4,0) auxiliary multiplets. We propose that our final
result gives a solution to a twenty year-old 2D supersymmetry problem in the
physics literature.
