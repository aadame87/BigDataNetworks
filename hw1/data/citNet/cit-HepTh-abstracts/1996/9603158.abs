  Supersymmetry breaking by the quantum deformation of a classical moduli space
is considered. A simple, non-chiral, renormalizable model is presented to
illustrate this mechanism. The well known, chiral, $SU(3) \times SU(2)$ model
and its generalizations are shown to break supersymmetry by this mechanism in
the limit $\Lambda_2 \gg \Lambda_3$. Other supersymmetry breaking models, with
classical flat directions that are only lifted quantum mechanically, are
presented. Finally, by integrating in vector matter, the strongly coupled
region of chiral models with a dynamically generated superpotential is shown to
be continuously connected to a weakly coupled description in terms of confined
degrees of freedom, with supersymmetry broken at tree level.
