  When Alf`ven effect is peresent in magnetohydrodynamics one is naturally lead
to consider conformal field theories, which have logarithmic terms in their
correlation functions. We discuss the implications of such logarithmic terms
and find a unique conformal field theory with centeral charge
$c=-\frac{209}{7}$, within the border of the minimal series, which satisfies
all the constraints. The energy espectrum is found to be \newline $E(k)\sim
k^{-\frac{13}{7}} \log{k}$.
