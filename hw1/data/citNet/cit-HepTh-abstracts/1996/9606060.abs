\\
  Considering the linearized gravity with matter fields, the effective
potential of the ``conformal dilaton'' in the string frame is generated
semiclassically by one-loop contribution of heavy matter fields. This in turn
generates a nontrivial potential for the physical dilaton in the Einstein frame
with the trace of the graviton in the Einstein frame gauged away. The remaining
manifest local spacetime symmetry is only the volume preserving diffeomorphism
symmetry. The consistency of this procedure is examined and the possibility of
spontaneous diffeomorphism symmetry breaking is suggested.
