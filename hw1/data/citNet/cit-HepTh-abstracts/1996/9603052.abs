  A pseudoclassical model is proposed to describe massive Dirac (spin one-half)
particles in arbitrary odd dimensions. The quantization of the model reproduces
the minimal quantum theory of spinning particles in such dimensions. A
dimensional duality between the model proposed and the pseudoclassical
description of Weyl particles in even dimensions is discussed.
