  Quantizing the electromagnetic field with a group formalism faces the
difficulty of how to turn the traditional gauge transformation of the vector
potential, $A_{\mu}(x)\rightarrow A_{\mu}(x)+\partial_{\mu}\varphi(x)$, into a
group law. In this paper it is shown that the problem can be solved by looking
at gauge transformations in a slightly different manner which, in addition,
does not require introducing any BRST-like parameter. This gauge transformation
does not appear explicitly in the group law of the symmetry but rather as the
trajectories associated with generalized equations of motion generated by
vector fields with null Noether invariants. In the new approach the parameters
of the local group, $U(1)(\vec{x},t)$, acquire dynamical content outside the
photon mass shell, a fact which also allows a unified quantization of both the
electromagnetic and Proca fields.
