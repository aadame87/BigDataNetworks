  A systematic algorithm for obtaining recurrence relations for dimensionally
regularized Feynman integrals w.r.t. the space-time dimension $d$ is proposed.
The relation between $d$ and $d-2$ dimensional integrals is given in terms of a
differential operator for which an explicit formula can be obtained for each
Feynman diagram. We show how the method works for one-, two- and three-loop
integrals. The new recurrence relations w.r.t. $d$ are complementary to the
recurrence relations which derive from the method of integration by parts. We
find that the problem of the irreducible numerators in Feynman integrals can be
naturally solved in the framework of the proposed generalized recurrence
relations.
