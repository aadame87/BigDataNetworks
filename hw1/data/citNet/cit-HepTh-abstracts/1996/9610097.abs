  The generalized Killing equations for the configuration space of spinning
particles (spinning space) are analysed. Solutions of these equations are
expressed in terms of Killing-Yano tensors. In general the constants of motion
can be seen as extensions of those from the scalar case or new ones depending
on the Grassmann-valued spin variables.
