  A free lattice fermion field theory in 1+1 dimensions can be interpreted as
SOS-type model, whose spins are integer-valued. We point out that the relation
between these spins and the fermion field is similar to the abelian
bosonization relation between bosons and fermions in the continuum. Though on
the lattice the connected $2n$-point correlation functions of the
integer-valued spins are not zero for any $n \ge 1$, the two-point correlation
function of these spins is that of free bosons in the infrared. We also
conjecture the form of the Wess-Zumino-Witten chiral field operator in a
nonabelian lattice fermion model. These constructions are similar in spirit to
the ``twistable string" idea of Krammer and Nielsen.
