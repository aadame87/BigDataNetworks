  In the pseudo-euclidean metrics Chern-Simons gauge theory in the infrared
region is found to be associated with dissipative dynamics. In the infrared
limit the Lagrangian of 2+1 dimensional pseudo-euclidean topologically massive
electrodynamics has indeed the same form of the Lagrangian of the damped
harmonic oscillator. On the hyperbolic plane a set of two damped harmonic
oscillators, each other time-reversed, is shown to be equivalent to a single
undamped harmonic oscillator. The equations for the damped oscillators are
proven to be the same as the ones for the Lorentz force acting on two particles
carrying opposite charge in a constant magnetic field and in the electric
harmonic potential. This provides an immediate link with Chern-Simons-like
dynamics of Bloch electrons in solids propagating along the lattice plane with
hyperbolic energy surface. The symplectic structure of the reduced theory is
finally discussed in the Dirac constrained canonical formalism.
