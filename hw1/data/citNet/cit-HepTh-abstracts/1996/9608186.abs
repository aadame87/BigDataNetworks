  We study some aspects of enhanced gauge symmetries in F-theory compactified
on K3. We find open string configurations connecting various 7-branes which
represent stable BPS states. In this approach we recover $D_n$ and $E_n$ gauge
groups previously found from an analysis of sigularities of the moduli space of
elliptically fibered K3 manifolds as well as examples of non-perturbative
realizations of $A_n$ groups.
