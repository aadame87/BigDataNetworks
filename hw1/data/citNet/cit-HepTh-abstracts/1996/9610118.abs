  Quantum tunneling between degenerate ground states through the central
barrier of a potential is extended to excited states with the instanton method.
This extension is achieved with the help of an LSZ reduction technique as in
field theory and may be of importance in the study of macroscopic quantum
phenomena in magnetic systems.
