  Connes has extended Einstein's principle of general relativity to
noncommutative geometry. The new principle implies that the Dirac operator is
covariant with respect to Lorentz and internal gauge transformations and the
Dirac operator must include Yukawa couplings. It further implies that the
action for the metric, the gauge potentials and the Higgs scalar is coded in
the spectrum of the covariant Dirac operator. This ``universal'' action has
been computed by Chamseddine & Connes, it is the coupled Einstein-Hilbert and
Yang-Mills-Higgs action. This result is rederived and we discuss the physical
consequences.
