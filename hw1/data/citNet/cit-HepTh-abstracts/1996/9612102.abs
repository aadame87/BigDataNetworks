  The string field theory of N=(2,1) heterotic strings describes a set of
self-dual Yang-Mills fields coupled to self-dual gravity in 2+2 dimensions. We
show that the exact classical action for this field theory is a certain
complexification of the Green-Schwarz/Dirac-Born-Infeld string action, closely
related to the four dimensional Wess-Zumino action describing self-dual gauge
fields. This action describes the world-volume of a 2+2d ``M-brane'', which
gives rise upon different null reductions to critical strings and membranes. We
discuss a number of further properties of N=2 heterotic strings, such as the
geometry of null reduction, general features of a covariant formulation, and
possible relations to BPS and GKM algebras.
