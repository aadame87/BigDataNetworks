  The free action for massless Ramond-Ramond fields is derived from closed
superstring field theory using the techniques of Siegel and Zwiebach. For the
uncompactified Type IIB superstring, this gives a manifestly Lorentz-covariant
action for a self-dual five-form field strength. Upon compactification to four
dimensions, the action depends on a U(1) field strength from 4D N=2
supergravity. However, unlike the standard Maxwell action, this action is
manifestly invariant under the electromagnetic duality transformation which
rotates $F_{mn}$ into $\epsilon_{mnpq} F^{pq}$.
