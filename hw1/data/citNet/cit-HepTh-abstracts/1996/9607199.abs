Title: Gauge Independent Lagrangian Reduction of Constrained Systems
Authors: R. Banerjee
Comments: LaTex 9 pages
\\
  A gauge independent method of obtaining the reduced space of constrained
dynamical systems is discussed in a purely lagrangian formalism. Implications
of gauge fixing are also considered.
