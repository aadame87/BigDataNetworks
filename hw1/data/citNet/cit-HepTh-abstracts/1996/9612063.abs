  We consider the (2+1)-dimensional gauged Heisenberg ferromagnet model coupled
with the Chern-Simons gauge fields. Self-dual Chern-Simons solitons, the static
zero energy solution saturating Bogomol'nyi bounds, are shown to exist when the
generalized spin variable is valued in the Hermitian symmetric spaces G/H. By
gauging the maximal torus subgroup of H, we obtain self-dual solitons which
satisfy vortex-type nonlinear equations thereby extending the two dimensional
instantons in a nontrivial way. An explicit example for the CP(N) case is
given.
