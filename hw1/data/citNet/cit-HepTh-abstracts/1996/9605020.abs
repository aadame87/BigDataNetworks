  We describe an approach to classify (meromorphic) representations of a given
vertex operator algebra by calculating Zhu's algebra explicitly. We demonstrate
this for FKS lattice theories and subtheories corresponding to the Z_2
reflection twist and the Z_3 twist. Our work is mainly offering a novel
uniqueness tool, but, as shown in the Z_3 case, it can also be used to extract
enough information to construct new representations. We prove the existence and
some properties of a new non-unitary representation of the Z_3-invariant
subtheory of the (two dimensional) Heisenberg algebra.
