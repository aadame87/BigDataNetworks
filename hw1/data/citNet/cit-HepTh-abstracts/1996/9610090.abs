  The deformation of a topological field theory, namely the pure BF theory,
gives the first order formulation of Yang-Mills theory; Feynman rules are given
and the standard uv-behaviour is recovered. In this formulation new non local
observables can be introduced following the topological theory and giving an
explicit realization of `t Hooft algebra.
