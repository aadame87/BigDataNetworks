  The point of this paper is see what light new results in hyperbolic geometry
may throw on gravitational entropy and whether gravitational entropy is
relevant for the quantum origin of the univeres. We introduce some new
gravitational instantons which mediate the birth from nothing of closed
universes containing wormholes and suggest that they may contribute to the
density matrix of the universe. We also discuss the connection between their
gravitational action and the topological and volumetric entropies introduced in
hyperbolic geometry. These coincide for hyperbolic 4-manifolds, and increase
with increasing topological complexity of the four manifold. We raise the
questions of whether the action also increases with the topological complexity
of the initial 3-geometry, measured either by its three volume or its Matveev
complexity. We point out, in distinction to the non-supergravity case,
that universes with domains of negative cosmological constant separated by
supergravity domain walls cannot be born from nothing. Finally we point out
that our wormholes provide examples of the type of Perpetual Motion machines
envisaged by Frolov and Novikov.
