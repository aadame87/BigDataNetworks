  Representations of the quantum q-oscillator algebra are studied with
particular attention to local Hamiltonian representations of the Schroedinger
type. In contrast to the standard harmonic oscillators such systems exhibit a
continuous spectrum. The general scheme of realization of the q-oscillator
algebra on the space of wave functions for a one-dimensional Schroedinger
Hamiltonian shows the existence of non-Fock irreducible representations
associated to the continuous part of the spectrum and directly related to the
deformation. An algorithm for the mapping of energy levels is described.
