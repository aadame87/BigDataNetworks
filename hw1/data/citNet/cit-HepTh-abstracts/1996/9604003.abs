  The Eguchi-Hanson, Taub-NUT and Atiyah-Hitchin metrics are the only complete
non-singular SO(3)-invariant hyper-Kahler metrics in four dimensions. The
presence of a rotational SO(2) isometry allows for their unified treatment
based on solutions of the 3-dim continual Toda equation. We determine the Toda
potential in each case and examine the free field realization of the
corresponding solutions, using infinite power series expansions. The
Atiyah-Hitchin metric exhibits some unusual features attributed to topological
properties of the group of area preserving diffeomorphisms. The construction of
a descending series of SO(2)-invariant 4-dim regular hyper-Kahler metrics
remains an interesting question.
