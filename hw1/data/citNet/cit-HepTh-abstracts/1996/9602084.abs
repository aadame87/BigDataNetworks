  We analyze the quantum cosmology of one--loop string effective models which
exhibit an $O(d,d)$ symmetry. It is shown that due to the large symmetry of
these models the Wheeler--de Witt equation can completely be solved. As a
result, we find a basis of solutions with well defined transformation
properties under $O(d,d)$ and under scale factor duality in particular. The
general results are explicitly applied to 2--dimensional target spaces while
some aspects of higher dimensional cases are also discussed. Moreover, a
semiclassical wave function for the 2-dimensional black hole is constructed as
a superposition of our basis.
