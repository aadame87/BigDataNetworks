  We discuss supersymmetry in twelve dimensions and present a covariant
supersymmetric action for a brane with worldsheet signature (2,2), called a
super (2+2)-brane, propagating in the osp(64,12) superspace. This superspace is
explicitly constructed, and is trivial in the sense that the spinorial part is
a trivial bundle over spacetime, unlike the twisted superspace of usual
Poincare supersymmetry. For consistency, it is necessary to take a projection
of the superspace. This is the same as the projection required for worldvolume
supersymmetry. Upon compactification of this superspace, a torsion is naturally
introduced and we produce the membrane and type IIB string actions in 11 and 10
dimensional Minkowski spacetimes. In addition, the compactification of the
twelve dimensional supersymmetry algebra produces the correct algebras for
these theories, including central charges. These considerations thus give the
type IIB string and M-theory a single twelve dimensional origin.
