  Dimensional reduction of a self-dual tensor gauge field in 6d gives an
Abelian vector gauge field in 5d. We derive the conditions under which an
interacting 5d theory of an Abelian vector gauge field is the dimensional
reduction of a 6d Lorentz invariant interacting theory of a self-dual tensor.
Then we specialize to the particular 6d theory that gives 5d Born-Infeld
theory. The field equation and Lagrangian of this 6d theory are formulated with
manifest 5d Lorentz invariance, while the remaining Lorentz symmetries are
realized nontrivially. A string soliton with finite tension and self-dual
charge is constructed.
