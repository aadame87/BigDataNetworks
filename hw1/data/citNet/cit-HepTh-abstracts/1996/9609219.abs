  We propose a non-perturbative solution of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory
in five dimensions compactified on circle of a radius $R$. We consider the
cases of the pure gauge theory as well as the theories with matter in the
fundamental and in the adjoint representations. The pure theory as well as the
one with adjoint hypermultiplet give rise to the known relativistic integrable
systems with ${1\over{R}}$ playing the r\^ole of the speed of light. The theory
with adjoint hypermultiplet exhibits some interesting finiteness properties.
  Talk given at the III International Conference ``Conformal Field Theories and
Integrable Models'', Chernogolovka, June 23-30 1996
