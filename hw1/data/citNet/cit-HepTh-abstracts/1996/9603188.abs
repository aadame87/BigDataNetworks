  Dual Feynman rules for Dirac monopoles in Yang-Mills fields are obtained by
the Wu-Yang (1976) criterion in which dynamics result as a consequence of the
constraint defining the monopole as a topological obstruction in the field. The
usual path-integral approach is adopted, but using loop space variables of the
type introduced by Polyakov (1980). An anti-symmetric tensor potential
$L_{\mu\nu}[\xi|s]$ appears as the Lagrange multiplier for the Wu-Yang
constraint which has to be gauge-fixed because of the ``magnetic''
$\widetilde{U}$-symmetry of the theory. Two sets of ghosts are thus introduced,
which subsequently integrate out and decouple. The generating functional is
then calculated to order $g^0$ and expanded in a series in $\widetilde{g}$. It
is shown to be expressible in terms of a local ``dual potential''
$\widetilde{A}_\mu (x)$ found earlier, which has the same progagator and the
same interaction vertex with the monopole field as those of the ordinary
Yang-Mills potential $A_\mu$ with a colour charge, indicating thus a certain
degree of dual symmetry in the theory. For the abelian case the Feynman rules
obtained here are the same as in QED to all orders in $g$, as expected by dual
symmetry.
