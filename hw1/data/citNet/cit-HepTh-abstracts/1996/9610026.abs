  The recently rigorously proved nonperturbative relation between u and the
prepotential, underlying N=2 SYM with gauge group SU(2), implies both the
reflection symmetry $\overline{u(\tau)}=u(-\bar\tau)$ and $u(\tau+1)=-u(\tau)$
which hold exactly. The relation also implies that $\tau$ is the inverse of the
uniformizing coordinate u of the moduli space of quantum vacua. In this
context, the above quantum symmetries are the key points to determine the
structure of the moduli space. It turns out that the functions a(u) and a_D(u),
which we derive from first principles, actually coincide with the solution
proposed by Seiberg and Witten. We also consider some relevant generalizations.
