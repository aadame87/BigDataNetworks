  We give an elementary derivation of the de Rham cohomology of SO(n) in terms
of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Our analysis is based on Witten's Morse
theory. We show reflection symmetries of the theory are useful to select true
vacuums. The number of the selected vacuums will agree with the de Rham
cohomology of SO(n).
