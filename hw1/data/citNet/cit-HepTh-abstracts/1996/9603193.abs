  We derive closed analytical expressions for the complex Berry phase of an
open quantum system in a state which is a superposition of resonant states and
evolves irreversibly due to the spontaneous decay of the metastable states. The
codimension of an accidental degeneracy of resonances and the geometry of the
energy hypersurfaces close to a crossing of resonances differ significantly
from those of bound states. We discuss some of the consequences of these
differences for the geometric phase factors, such as: Instead of a diabolical
point singularity there is a continuous closed line of singularities formally
equivalent to a continuous distribution of `magnetic' charge on a diabolical
circle; different classes of topologically inequivalent non-trivial closed
paths in parameter space, the topological invariant associated to the sum of
the geometric phases, dilations of the wave function due to the imaginary part
of the Berry phase and others.
