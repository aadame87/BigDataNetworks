  We construct new supersymmetric solutions of $D$=11 supergravity describing
$n$ orthogonally ``overlapping" membranes and fivebranes for $n$=2,\dots,8.
Overlapping branes arise after separating intersecting branes in a direction
transverse to all of the branes. The solutions, which generalize known
intersecting brane solutions, preserve at least $2^{-n}$ of the supersymmetry.
Each pairwise overlap involves a membrane overlapping a membrane in a 0-brane,
a fivebrane overlapping a fivebrane in a 3-brane or a membrane overlapping a
fivebrane in a string. After reducing $n$ overlapping membranes to obtain $n$
overlapping $D$-2-branes in $D$=10, $T$-duality generates new overlapping
$D$-brane solutions in type IIA and type IIB string theory. Uplifting certain
type IIA solutions leads to the $D$=11 solutions. Some of the new solutions
reduce to dilaton black holes in $D$=4. Additionally, we present a $D$=10
solution that describes two $D$-5-branes overlapping in a string. $T$-duality
then generates further $D$=10 solutions and uplifting one of the type IIA
solutions gives a new $D$=11 solution describing two fivebranes overlapping in
a string.
