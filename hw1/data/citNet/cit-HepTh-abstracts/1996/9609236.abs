Title: Exact Renormalization Group with Fermions
Author: Jordi Comellas
Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX with sprocl.sty, talk given at RG96, Dubna
\\
  The development of the Exact Renormalization Group for fermionic theories is
presented, together with its application to the chiral Gross-Neveu model. We
focus on the reliability of various approximations, specifically the derivative
expansion and further truncations in the number of fields. The main differences
with bosonic theories are discussed.
