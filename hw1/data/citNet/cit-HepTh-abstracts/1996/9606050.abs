  We analyse the fusion of representations of the triplet algebra, the
maximally extended symmetry algebra of the Virasoro algebra at c=-2. It is
shown that there exists a finite number of representations which are closed
under fusion. These include all irreducible representations, but also some
reducible representations which appear as indecomposable components in fusion
products.
