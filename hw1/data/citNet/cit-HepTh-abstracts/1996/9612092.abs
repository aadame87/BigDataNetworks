  General permutation invariant statistics in the second quantized approach are
considered. Simple interpolations between dual statistics are constructed.
Particularly, we present a new minimal interpolation between parabosons and
parafermions of any order. The connection with a simple mixing between bosons
and fermions is established. The construction is extended to anyonic-like
statistics.
