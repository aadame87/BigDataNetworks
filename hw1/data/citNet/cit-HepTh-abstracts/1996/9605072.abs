  An extension of the Connes--Lott model is proposed. It is also within the
framework of the A.Connes construction based on a generalized Dirac--Yukawa
operator and the K--cycle $(H,D)$, with $H$ a fermionic Hilbert space. The
basic algebra $A$ which may be considered as representing the non--commutative
extension, plays a less important role in our approach. This allows a new class
of natural extensions. The proposed extension lies in a sense between the
Connes--Lott and the Marseille--Mainz model. It leads exactly to the standard
model of electroweak interactions.
