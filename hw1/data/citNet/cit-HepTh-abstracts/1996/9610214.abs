  Two-step mechanisms in the $N\bar{N}$ annihilation and their role in the OZI
rule violating reactions are discussed. In particular the two meson
rescattering mechanism for $\pi\phi$ channel including all off-shell effects is
typically two orders of magnitude bigger than the OZI tree level expectation
and explains the observed ratio $\phi \pi/\omega \pi$ in the annihilation at
rest. The rates for the final states including photons, $\gamma\omega$ and
$\gamma\phi$, can be explained in the vector dominance model. The observed rate
for $p\bar{p}\to\gamma\omega$ is suppressed due to destructive interference
between the intermediate $\rho$ and $\omega$ states while the interference in
$p\bar{p}\to\gamma\phi$ is required to be constructive leading to a large ratio
$\gamma\phi/\gamma\omega$.
