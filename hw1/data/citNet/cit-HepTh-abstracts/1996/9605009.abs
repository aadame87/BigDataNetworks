  The implications of conformal invariance, as relevant in quantum field
theories at a renormalisation group fixed point, are analysed with particular
reference to results for correlation functions involving conserved currents and
the energy momentum tensor. Ward identities resulting from conformal invariance
are discussed. Explicit expressions for two and three point functions, which
are essentially determined by conformal invariance, are obtained. As special
cases we consider the three point functions for two vector and an axial current
in four dimensions, which realises the usual anomaly simply and unambiguously,
and also for the energy momentum tensor in general dimension $d$. The latter is
shown to have two linearly independent forms in which the Ward identities are
realised trivially, except if $d = 4$, when the two forms become degenerate.
This is necessary in order to accommodate the two independent forms present in
the trace of the energy momentum tensor on curved space backgrounds for
conformal field theories in four dimensions. The coefficients of the two trace
anomaly terms are related to the three parameters describing the general energy
momentum tensor three point function. The connections with gravitational
effective actions depending on a background metric are described. A particular
form due to Riegert is shown to be unacceptable. Conformally invariant
expressions for the effective action in four dimensions are obtained using the
Green function for a differential operator which has simple properties under
local rescalings of the metric.
