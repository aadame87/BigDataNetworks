  The Wilson (exact) renormalization group equations are used to determine the
evolution of a general low energy N=1 supersymmetric action containing a U(1)
gauge vector multiplet and a neutral chiral multiplet. The effective theory
evolves towards satisfying a fixed relation where the K\"ahler potential and
effective gauge coupling are obtained from a N=2 supersymmetric holomorphic
prepotential.
