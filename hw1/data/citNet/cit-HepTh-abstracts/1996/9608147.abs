  We consider Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking (DSB) in models with classical
flat directions. We analyze a number of examples, and develop a systematic
approach to determine if classical flat directions are stabilized in the full
quantum theory, or lead to run-away behavior. In some cases pseudo-flat
directions remain even at the quantum level before taking into account
corrections to the K\"ahler potential. We show that in certain limits these
corrections are calculable. In particular, we find that in the
Intriligator-Thomas $SU(2)$ and its generalizations, a potential for moduli is
generated. Moreover, there is a region of the parameter space where K\"ahler
potential corrections lead to calculable (local) minima at large but finite
distance from the origin.
