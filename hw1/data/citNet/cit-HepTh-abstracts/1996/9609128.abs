  It is found that the number, $M_n$, of irreducible multiple zeta values
(MZVs) of weight $n$, is generated by $1-x^2-x^3=\prod_n (1-x^n)^{M_n}$. For
$9\ge n\ge3$, $M_n$ enumerates positive knots with $n$ crossings. Positive
knots to which field theory assigns knot-numbers that are not MZVs first appear
at 10 crossings. We identify all the positive knots, up to 15 crossings, that
are in correspondence with irreducible MZVs, by virtue of the connection
between knots and numbers realized by Feynman diagrams with up to 9 loops.
