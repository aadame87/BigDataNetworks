  We present non-extreme generalisations of intersecting p-brane solutions of
eleven-dimensional supergravity which upon toroidal compactification reduce to
non-extreme static black holes in dimensions D=4, D=5 and 5<D<10, parameterized
by four, three and two charges, respectively. The D=4 black holes are obtained
either from non-extreme configuration of three intersecting five-branes with a
boost along the common string or from non-extreme intersecting system of two
two-branes and two five-branes. The D=5 black holes arise from three
intersecting two-branes or from a system of intersecting two-brane and
five-brane with a boost along the common string. Five-brane and two-brane with
a boost along one direction reduce to black holes in D=6 and D=9, respectively,
while D=7 black hole can be interpreted in terms of non-extreme configuration
of two intersecting two-branes. We discuss the expressions for the
corresponding masses and entropies.
