  A tensor product generalisation of $B\wedge F$ theories is proposed to give a
Bogomol'nyi structure. Non-singular, stable, finite-energy particle-like
solutions to the Bogomol'nyi equations are studied. Unlike Yang-Mills(-Higgs)
theory, the Bogomol'nyi structure does not appear as a perfect square in the
Lagrangian. Consequently, the Bogomol'nyi energy can be obtained in more than
one way. The added flexibility permits electric monopole solutions to the field
equations.
