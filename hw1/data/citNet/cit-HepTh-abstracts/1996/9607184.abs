  The restrictions of target--space duality are imposed at the perturbative
level on the holomorphic Wilsonian couplings that encode certain higher-order
gravitational interactions in $N=2, D=4$ heterotic string compactifications. A
crucial role is played by non-holomorphic corrections. The requirement of
symplectic covariance and an associated symplectic anomaly equation play an
important role in determining their form. For models which also admit a type-II
description, this equation coincides with the holomorphic anomaly equation for
type-II compactifications in the limit that a specific K\"ahler-class modulus
grows large. We explicitly evaluate some of the higher-order couplings for a
toroidal compactification with two moduli $T$ and $U$, and we express them in
terms of modular forms.
