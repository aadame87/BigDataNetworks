  We study limits of four-dimensional type II Calabi-Yau compactifications
with vanishing four-cycle singularities, which are dual to $\IT^2$
compactifications of the six-dimensional non-critical string with $E_8$
symmetry. We define proper subsectors of the full string theory, which can be
consistently decoupled. In this way we obtain rigid effective theories that
have an intrinsically stringy BPS spectrum. Geometrically the moduli spaces
correspond to special geometry of certain non-compact Calabi-Yau spaces of an
intriguing form. An equivalent description can be given in terms of
Seiberg-Witten curves, given by the elliptic simple singularities together with
a peculiar choice of meromorphic differentials. We speculate that the moduli
spaces describe non-perturbative non-critical string theories.
