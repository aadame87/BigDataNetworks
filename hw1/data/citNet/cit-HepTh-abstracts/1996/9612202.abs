  We study some applications of solvable Lie algebras in type IIA, type IIB and
M theories. RR and NS generators find a natural geometric interpretation in
this framework. Special emphasis is given to the counting of the abelian
nilpotent ideals (translational symmetries of the scalar manifolds) in
arbitrary D dimensions. These are seen to be related, using Dynkin diagram
techniques, to one-form counting in D+1 dimensions. A recipy for gauging
isometries in this framework is also presented. In particular, we list the
gauge groups both for compact and translational isometries. The former agree
with some results already existing in gauged supergravity. The latter should be
possibly related to the study of partial supersymmetry breaking, as suggested
by a similar role played by solvable Lie algebras in N=2 gauged supergravity.
