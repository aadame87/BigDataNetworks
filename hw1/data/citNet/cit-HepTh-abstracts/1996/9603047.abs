  The $SO(4)\times U(1)$ Higgs model on $\R_4$ is extended by a $F^3$ term so
that the action receives a nonvanishing contribution from the interactions of
2-instantons and 3-instantons, and can be expressed as the inverse of the
Laplacian on $\R_4$ in terms of the mutual distances of the instantons. The
one-instanton solutions of both the basic and the extended models have been
studied in detail numerically.
