Title: Strong-Weak Coupling Duality in Quantum Mechanics
Author: A. de Souza Dutra
Comments: 6 pages, Plain Latex
\\
  We present a strong-weak coupling duality for quantum mechanical potentials.
Similarly to what happens in quantum field theory, it relates two problems with
inverse couplings, leading to a mapping of the strong coupling regime into the
weak one, giving information from the nonperturbative region of the parameters
space. It can be used to solve exactly power-type potentials and to extract
deep information about the energy spectra of polynomial ones.
