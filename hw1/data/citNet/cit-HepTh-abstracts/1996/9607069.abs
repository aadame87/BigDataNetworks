  We apply the gauge theory on $M_4\times Z_2$ geometry previously proposed by
Konisi and Saito to the Weinberg-Salam model for electroweak interactions,
especially in order to clarify the geometrical meaning of curvatures in this
geometry. Considering the Higgs field to be a gauge field along $Z_2$
direction, we also discuss the BRST invariant gauge fixing in this theory.
