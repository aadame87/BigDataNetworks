  We compute the leading order (in coupling) rate of emission of low energy
quanta from a slightly nonextremal system of 1 and 5 D-branes. We also compute
the classical cross-section, and hence the Hawking emission rate, for low
energy scalar quanta for the black hole geometry that corresponds to these
branes (at sufficiently strong coupling). These rates are found to agree with
each other.
