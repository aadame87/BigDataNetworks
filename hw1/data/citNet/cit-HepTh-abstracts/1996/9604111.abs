  In this paper, we probe the validity of the tunnelling interpretation that is
usually called forth in literature to explain the phenomenon of particle
production by time independent classical electromagnetic backgrounds. We show
that the imaginary part of the effective lagrangian is zero for a complex
scalar field quantized in a time independent, but otherwise arbitrary, magnetic
field. This result implies that no pair creation takes place in such a
background. But we find that when the quantum field is decomposed into its
normal modes in the presence of a spatially confined and time independent
magnetic field, there exists a non-zero tunnelling probability for the
effective Schr{\" o}dinger equation. According to the tunnelling
interpretation, this result would imply that spatially confined magnetic fields
can produce particles, thereby contradicting the result obtained from the
effective lagrangian. This lack of consistency between these two approaches
calls into question the validity of attributing a non-zero tunnelling
probability for the effective Schr{\" o}dinger equation to the production of
particles by the time independent electromagnetic backgrounds. The implications
of our analysis are discussed.
