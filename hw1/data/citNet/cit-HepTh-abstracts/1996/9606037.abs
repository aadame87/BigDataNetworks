  A lower bound is placed on the fermionic determinant of Euclidean quantum
electrodynamics in three dimensions in the presence of a smooth, finite--flux,
static, unidirectional magnetic field
$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})=(0,0,B(\mathbf{r}))$, where $B(\mathbf{r})\geq 0$ or
$B(\mathbf{r})\leq 0$ and $\mathbf r$ is a point in the $xy\mbox{-plane}$.
Bounds are also obtained for the induced spin for $2+1$ dimensional QED in the
presence of $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})$. An upper bound is placed on the fermionic
determinant of Euclidean QED in four dimensions in the presence of a strong,
static, directionally-varying, square-integrable magnetic field
$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})$ on $\R^3 $.
