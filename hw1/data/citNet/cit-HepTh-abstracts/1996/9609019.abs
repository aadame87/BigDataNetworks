  We investigate phase transitions in three dimensional scalar matrix models,
with special emphasis on complex $2 \times 2$ matrices. The universal equation
of state for weak first order phase transitions is computed. We also study the
coarse grained free energy. Its dependence on the coarse graining scale gives a
quantitative criterion for the validity of the standard treatment of bubble
nucleation.
