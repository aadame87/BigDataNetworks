  Low--energy limits of N=2 supersymmetric field theories in the Higgs branch
are described in terms of a non--linear 4--dimensional sigma--model on a \hk
target space, classically obtained as a \hk quotient of the original flat
hypermultiplet space by the gauge group. We review in a pedagogical way this
construction, and illustrate it in various examples, with special attention
given to the singularities emerging in the low--energy theory. In particular,
we thoroughly study the Higgs branch singularity of Seiberg--Witten $SU(2)$
theory with $N_f$ flavors, interpreted by Witten as a small instanton
singularity in the moduli space of one instanton on $\RR^4$. By explicitly
evaluating the metric, we show that this Higgs branch coincides with the Higgs
branch of a $U(1)$ N=2 SUSY theory with the number of flavors predicted by the
singularity structure of Seiberg--Witten's theory in the Coulomb phase. We find
another example of Higgs phase duality, namely between the Higgs phases of
$U(N_c)\; N_f$ flavors and $U(N_f-N_c)\; N_f$ flavors theories, by using a
geometric interpretation due to Biquard et al. This duality may be relevant for
understanding Seiberg's conjectured duality $N_c \leftrightarrow N_f-N_c$ in
N=1 SUSY $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories.
