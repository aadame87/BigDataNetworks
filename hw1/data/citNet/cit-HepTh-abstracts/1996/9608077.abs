  $N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories with global flavor symmetries contain a
gauge invariant W-superalgebra which acts on its moduli space of gauge
invariants. With adjoint matter, this superalgebra reduces to a graded Lie
algebra. When the gauge group is $SO(n_c)$, with vector matter, it is a
W-algebra, and the primary invariants form one of its representation. The same
superalgebra exists in the dual theory, but its construction in terms of the
dual fields suggests that duality may be understood in terms of a charge
conjugation within the algebra. We extend the analysis to the gauge group
$E_6$.
