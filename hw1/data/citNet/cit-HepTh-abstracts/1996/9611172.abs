  We study orbifolds of (0,2) models, including some cases with discrete
torsion. Our emphasis is on models which have a Landau-Ginzburg realization,
where we describe part of the massless spectrum by computing the elliptic genus
for the orbifolded theory. Somewhat surprisingly, we find simple examples of
(0,2) mirror pairs that are related by a quotient action. We present a detailed
description of a family of such pairs.
