Title: Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics and Noncommutative Dynamics
Author: Stephen L. Adler
Comments: Plain Tex, 7 pages, no figures
Report-no: IASSNS-HEP 96-72
\\
  In this talk I shall first make some brief remarks on quaternionic quantum
mechanics, and then describe recent work with A.C. Millard in which we show
that standard complex quantum field theory can arise as the statistical
mechanics of an underlying noncommutative dynamics.
