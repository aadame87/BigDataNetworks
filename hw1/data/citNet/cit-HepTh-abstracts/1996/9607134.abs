Title: The Metric on the Space of Yang-Mills Configurations
Author: Peter Orland
Comments: 41 pages, Latex, 2 postcript figures. Some corrections are made
  concerning 1) Chern-Simons integrals in sections 2 and 10, 2) and error in
  the discussion of the intrinsic metric in section 5, 2) the defnition of
  equivalence classes and 4) a few more details on the four metric properties.

  A distance function on the set of physical equivalence classes of Yang-Mills
configurations considered by Feynman and by Atiyah, Hitchin and Singer is
studied for both the $2+1$ and $3+1$-dimensional Hamiltonians. This set
equipped with this distance function is a metric space, and in fact a
Riemannian manifold as Singer observed. Furthermore, this manifold is
complete. Gauge configurations can be used to parametrize the manifold. The
metric tensor without gauge fixing has zero eigenvalues, but is free of
ambiguities on the entire manifold. In $2+1$ dimensions the problem of
finding the distance from any configuration to a pure gauge configuration is
an integrable system of two-dimensional differential equations. A calculus of
manifolds with singular metric tensors is developed and the Riemann curvature
is calculated using this calculus. The Laplacian on Yang-Mills wave
functionals has a slightly different form from that claimed earlier. In
$3+1$-dimensions there are field configurations an arbitrarily large distance
from a pure gauge configuration with arbitrarily small potential energy.
These configurations resemble long-wavelength gluons. Reasons why there
nevertheless can be a mass gap in the quantum theory are proposed.
