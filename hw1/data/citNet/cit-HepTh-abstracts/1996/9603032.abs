  In this article we show that if the electrons in a quantum Hall sample are
subjected to a constant electric field in the plane of the material, comparable
in magnitude to the background magnetic field on the system of electrons, a
multiplicity of edge states localised in different regions of space is produced
in the sample. The actions governing the dynamics of these edge states are
obtained starting from the well-known Schr\"odinger field theory for a system
of non-relativistic electrons, where on top of the constant background electric
and magnetic fields, the electrons are further subject to slowly varying weak
electromagnetic fields. In the regions between the edges, dubbed as the "bulk",
the fermions can be integrated out entirely and the dynamics expressed in terms
of a local effective action involving the slowly varying electromagnetic
potentials. It is further shown how the "bulk" action is gauge non-invariant in
a particular way and how the edge states conspire to restore the U(1)
electromagnetic gauge invariance of the system.
