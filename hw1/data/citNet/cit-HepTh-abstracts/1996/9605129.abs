Title: Dirac Operators and Clifford Geometry - New Unifying Principles in
  Particle Physics ?
Author: Thomas Ackermann
Comments: 8 pages, plain tex, Lecture at the IV th Conference on Clifford
  Algebras and their Applications in Mathematical Physics, Aachen, Germany, May
  28 - 31, 1996, some misprints in corollary 4 and (16) corrected
\\
  In this lecture I will report on some recent progress in understanding the
relation of Dirac operators on Clifford modules over an even-dimensional closed
Riemannian manifold $M$\ and (euclidean) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs models.
