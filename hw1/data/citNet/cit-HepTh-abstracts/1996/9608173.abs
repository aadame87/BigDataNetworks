  We show how toroidally-compactified eleven-dimensional supergravity can be
consistently truncated to yield a variety of maximally-supersymmetric
``massive'' supergravities in spacetime dimensions $D\le 8$. The mass terms arise
as a consequence of making a more general ansatz than that in usual
Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, in which one or more axions are given an
additional linear dependence on one of the compactification coordinates. The
lower-dimensional theories are nevertheless consistent truncations of
eleven-dimensional supergravity. Owing to the fact that the generalised
reduction commutes neither with U-duality nor with ordinary dimensional
reduction, many different massive theories can result. The simplest examples
arise when just a single axion has the additional linear coordinate dependence.
We find five inequivalent such theories in $D=7$, and 71 inequivalent ones in
$D=4$. The massive theories admit no maximally-symmetric vacuum solution, but
they do admit $(D-2)$-brane solutions, i.e. domain walls, which preserve
half the supersymmetry. We present examples of these solutions, and their
oxidations to $D=11$. Some of the latter are new solutions of $D=11$
supergravity.
