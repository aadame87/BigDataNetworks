  We calculate the entropies of the system of classical particles and a quantum
scalar field by using the brick wall method in thermal bath in a charged Kerr
black hole spacetime. Their leading terms at Hartle-Hawking temperature $T_H =
\kappa/(2 \pi) $ are given by $ S_{cl} \approx N \ \ln \left(
\frac{A_b}{\epsilon^2} \right)$, and $S \approx N' \frac{A_H}{\epsilon^2}$,
where $A_b$ and $A_H$ are the area of the box and the horizon respectively.
