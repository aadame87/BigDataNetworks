  A supersymmetric gauge invariant action is constructed over any 4-dimensional
Riemannian manifold describing Witten's theory of 4-monopoles. The topological
supersymmetric algebra closes off-shell. The multiplets include the auxiliary
fields and the Wess-Zumino fields in an unusual way, arising naturally from
BRST gauge fixing. A new canonical approach over Riemann manifolds is followed,
using a Morse function as an euclidean time and taking into account the BRST
boundary conditions that come from the BFV formulation. This allows a
construction of the effective action starting from gauge principles.
