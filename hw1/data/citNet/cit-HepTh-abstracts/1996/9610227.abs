  Flux-string models can be used to study the deconfining phase transition. In
this note, we study the models proposed by Patel. We also study the large N_c
limits of Patel's model. To discuss the validity of the mean field theory
results, the one-loop Coleman-Weinberg effective potential is calculated for
N_c=3. We argue that the quantum corrections vanish at large N_c when the
energy of the so-called baryonic vertices scale with N_c.
