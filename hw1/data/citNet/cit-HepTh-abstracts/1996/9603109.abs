  A six-parameter family of five-dimensional black hole solutions is
constructed which are labeled by their mass, two asymptotic scalar fields and
three charges. It is shown that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is exactly
matched, arbitrarily far from extremality, by a simple but mysterious
duality-invariant extension of previously derived formulae for the number of
D-brane states in string theory.
