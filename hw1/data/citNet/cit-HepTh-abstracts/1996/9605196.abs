  We consider the large-$N$ Sutherland model in the Hamiltonian
collective-field approach based on the $1/N$ expansion. The Bogomol'nyi limit
appears and the corresponding solutions are given by static-soliton
configurations. They exist only for $\l<1$, i.e. for the negative coupling
constant of the Sutherland interaction. We determine their creation energies
and show that they are unaffected by higher-order corrections. For $\l=1$, the
Sutherland model reduces to the free one-plaquette Kogut-Susskind model.
