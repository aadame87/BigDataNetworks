  The quantum-mechanical problem of $N$ fermions with $\delta$-function
interaction in a one-dimensional potential well of finite depth is solved. It
is shown that there exists exact wave function of Bethe-ansatz form in the case
that a single particle tunnels outside of the well. The Bethe-ansatz like
secular equations for the spectrum are obtained.
