  A surface functional theory for p-dimensional extended objects, the
p-branes, was proposed in previous papers. The field equations for toroidal
p-branes was exactly solved in $d=p+2$ dimensions, yielding equally spaced
mass-squared spectrum with massless states. In this paper, we obtain the
asymptotic distribution of mass spectrum in the point-particle limit of the
theory with sphere-like membranes ($p=2$) in $d=4$ dimensions. Similarity
between this spectrum and that obtained in the Dirac's membrane model of
electron is discussed.
