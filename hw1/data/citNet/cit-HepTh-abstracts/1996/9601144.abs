  following from a wrong interpretation of a vielbein constraint has been
  corrected)

  We discuss a canonical formalism method for constructing actions describing
propagation of W-strings on curved backgrounds. The method is based on the
construction of a representation of the W-algebra in terms of currents made
from the string coordinates and the canonically conjugate momenta. We construct
such a representation for a W_3-string propagating in the background metric
with one flat direction by using a simple ansatz for the W-generators where
each generator is a polynomial of the canonical currents and the veilbeins. In
the case of a general background we show that the simple polynomial ansatz
fails, and terms containing the veilbein derivatives must be added.
