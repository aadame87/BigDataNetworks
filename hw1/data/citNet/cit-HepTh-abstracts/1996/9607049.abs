  We propose a hypothesis that all gauge theories are equivalent to a certain
non-standard string theory. Different gauge groups are accounted for by weights
ascribed to the world sheets of different topologies. The hypothesis is checked
in the case of the compact abelian theories, where we show how condensing
monopole -instanton fields are reproduced by the summation over surfaces. In
the non-abelian case we prove that the loop equations are satisfied modulo
contact terms. The structure of these terms unfortunately remains undetermined.
