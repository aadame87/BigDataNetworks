  Additional non-isospectral symmetries are formulated for the constrained
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (\cKP) integrable hierarchies. The problem of
compatibility of additional symmetries with the underlying constraints is
solved explicitly for the Virasoro part of the additional symmetry through
appropriate modification of the standard additional-symmetry flows for the
general (unconstrained) KP hierarchy. We also discuss the special case of \cKP
--truncated KP hierarchies, obtained as Darboux-B\"{a}cklund orbits of initial
purely differential Lax operators. The latter give rise to Toda-lattice-like
structures relevant for discrete (multi-)matrix models. Our construction
establishes the condition for commutativity of the additional-symmetry flows
with the discrete Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations of \cKP hierarchies
leading to a new derivation of the string-equation constraint in matrix models.
