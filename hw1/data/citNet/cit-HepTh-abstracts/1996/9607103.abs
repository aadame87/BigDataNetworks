Title: A Z_3-graded generalization of supermatrices
Authors: Bertrand Le Roy
Journal-ref: J.Math.Phys. 37 (1996) 474-483
\\
  We introduce Z_3-graded objects which are the generalization of the more
familiar Z_2-graded objects that are used in supersymmetric theories and in
many models of non-commutative geometry. First, we introduce the Z_3-graded
Grassmann algebra, and we use this object to construct the Z_3-matrices, which
are the generalizations of the supermatrices. Then, we generalize the concepts
of supertrace and superdeterminant.
