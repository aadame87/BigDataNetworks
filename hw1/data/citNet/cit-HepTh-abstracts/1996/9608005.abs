  Recently Banks, Douglas and Seiberg have shown that the world volume theory
of a three brane of the type IIB theory in the presence of a configuration of
four Dirichlet seven branes and an orientifold plane is described by an N=2
supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory with four quark flavours in 3+1 dimensions.
In this note we show how the BPS mass formula for N=2 supersymmetric gauge
theory arises from masses of open strings stretched between the three brane and
the seven brane along appropriate geodesics.
