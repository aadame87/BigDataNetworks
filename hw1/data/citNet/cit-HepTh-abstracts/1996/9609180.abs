  We construct sequences of axially symmetric multisphaleron solutions in SU(2)
Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. The sequences are labelled by a winding number
$n>1$. For $n=1$ the known sequence of spherically symmetric sphaleron
solutions is obtained. The solutions within each sequence are labelled by the
number of nodes $k$ of the gauge field functions. The limiting solutions of the
sequences correspond to abelian magnetic monopoles with $n$ units of charge and
energy $E \propto n$.
