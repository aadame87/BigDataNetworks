  Superstring field theory was recently used to derive a covariant action for a
self-dual five-form field strength. This action is shown to be a
ten-dimensional version of the McClain-Wu-Yu action. By coupling to D-branes,
it can be generalized in the presence of sources. In four dimensions, this
gives a local Maxwell action with electric and magnetic sources.
