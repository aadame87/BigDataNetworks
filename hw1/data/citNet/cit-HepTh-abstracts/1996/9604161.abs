  The two-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and the Noether current
are used to probe the O(3) nonlinear sigma model in an energy range below
10^4 in units of the mass gap $m$. We argue that the form factor approach,
with the form factor series trunctated at the 6-particle level, provides an
almost exact solution of the model in this energy range. The onset of the
(2-loop) perturbative regime is found to occur only at energies around $100m$.
