  We examine the pair creation of black holes in the presence of supergravity
domain walls with broken and unbroken supersymmetry. We show that black holes
will be nucleated in the presence of non- extreme, repulsive walls which break
the supersymmetry, but that as one allows the parameter measuring deviation
from extremality to approach zero the rate of creation will be suppressed. In
particular, we show that the probability for creation of black holes in the
presence of an extreme domain wall is identically zero, even though an extreme
vacuum domain wall still has repulsive gravitational energy. This is consistent
with the fact that the supersymmetric, extreme domain wall configurations are
BPS states and should be stable against quantum corrections. We discuss how
these walls arise in string theory, and speculate about what string theory
might tell us about such objects.
