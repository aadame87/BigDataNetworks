  I review some recent work that describes the close analogy between self-dual
Yang--Mills amplitudes and QCD amplitudes with external gluons of positive
helicity. This analogy is carried at tree level for amplitudes with two
external quarks and up to one-loop for amplitudes involving only external
gluons.
