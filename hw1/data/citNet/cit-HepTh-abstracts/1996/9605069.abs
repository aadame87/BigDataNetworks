  The Goddard, Nuyts and Olive conjecture for electric-magnetic duality in
Yang-Mills theory with an arbitrary gauge group G is extended by including a
non-vanishing vacuum angle $\theta$. This extended S-duality conjecture
includes the case when the unbroken gauge group is non-abelian and a definite
prediction for the spectrum of dyons results.
