  There is still confusion about the correct form of the area law for the
baryonic Wilson loop (BWL) of QCD. Strong-coupling (i.e., finite lattice
spacing in lattice gauge theory) approximations suggest the form $\exp
[-KA_Y]$, where $K$ is the $q\bar{q}$ string tension and $A_Y$ is the global
minimum area, generically a three-bladed area with the blades joined along a
Steiner line ($Y$ configuration). However, the correct answer is
$\exp[-(K/2)(A_{12}+A_{13}+A_{23})]$, where, e.g., $A_{12}$ is the minimal area
between quark lines 1 and 2 ($\Delta$ configuration). This second answer was
given long ago, based on certain approximations, and is also strongly favored
in lattice computations. In the present work, we derive the $\Delta$ law from
the usual vortex-monopole picture of confine- ment, and show that in any case
because of the 1/2 in the $\Delta$ law, this law leads to a larger value for
the BWL (smaller exponent) than does the $Y$ law. We show that the three-bladed
strong-coupling surfaces, which are infinitesimally thick in the limit of zero
lattice spacing, survive as surfaces to be used in the non-Abelian Stokes'
theorem for the BWL, which we derive, and lead via this Stokes' theorem to the
correct $\Delta$ law. Finally, we extend these considerations, including
perturbative contributions, to gauge groups $SU(N)$, with $N>3$.
