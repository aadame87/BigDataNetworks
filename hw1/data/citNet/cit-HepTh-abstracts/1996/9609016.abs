  We use the four-dimensional N=2 central charge superspace to give a
geometrical construction of the Abelian vector-tensor multiplet consisting,
under N=1 supersymmetry, of one vector and one linear multiplet. We derive the
component field supersymmetry and central charge transformations, and show that
there is a super-Lagrangian, the higher components of which are all total
derivatives, allowing us to construct superfield and component actions.
