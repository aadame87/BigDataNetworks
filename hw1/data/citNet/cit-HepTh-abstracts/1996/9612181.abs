  We discuss some of the classical and quantum geometry associated to the
degeneration of cycles within a Calabi-Yau compactification. In particular, we
focus on the definition and properties of quantum volume, especially as it
applies to identifying the physics associated to loci in moduli space where
nonperturbative effects become manifest. We discuss some unusual features of
quantum volume relative to its classical counterpart.
