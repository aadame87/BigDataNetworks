Title: Negative dimensional group extrapolation and dualities in N = 1
  supersymmetric gauge theories
Authors: Nobuhito Maru and Shinsaku Kitakado
Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, no figure, Manuscript has been substantially modified
  because the duality we proposed before as an application of our method was
  wrong. The title itself has been changed accordingly

  We point out that the similarities in N = 1 supersymmetric SO, SP gauge
theories can be explained by using the trick of extrapolating the groups to the
negative dimensions. One of the advantages of this trick is that anomaly
matching is automatically satisfied.
