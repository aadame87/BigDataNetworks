  The spontaneous magnetization in Chern-Simons QED_3 is discussed in a
finite temperature system. The thermodynamical potential is analyzed within the
weak field approximation and in the fermion massless limit. We find that there
is a linear term with respect to the magnetic field with a negative coefficient
at any finite temperature. This implies that the spontaneous magnetic field
does not vanish even at high temperature. In addition, we examine the photon
spectrum in the system. We find that the bare Chern-Simons coefficient is
cancelled by the radiative effects. The photons then become topologically
massless according to the magnetization, though they are massive by finite
temperature effects. Thus the magnetic field is a long-range force without the
screening even at high temperature.
