  Using renormalization group methods we calculate the derivative expansion of
the effective Lagrangian for a covariantly constant gauge field in curved
spacetime. Curvature affects the vacuum, in particular it could induce phase
transitions between different vacua. We also consider the effect of quantum
fluctuations of the metric , in the context of a renormalizable $R^2$ theory.
In this case the critical curvature depends on the gravi tational coupling
constants.
