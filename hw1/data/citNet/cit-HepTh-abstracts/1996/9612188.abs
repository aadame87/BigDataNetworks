  We study supersymmetric compactifications of type II strings on eightfolds to
two dimensions. It is demonstrated that the type IIB string on an eightfold is
free of gravitational anomalies. T-duality requires that this theory when
further compactified on a circle must have a vacuum momentum; this is
explicitly shown to be present and to have the right value. A subtlety in the
relation of IIB compactifications and M-Theory orientifolds to two dimensions
is pointed out.
