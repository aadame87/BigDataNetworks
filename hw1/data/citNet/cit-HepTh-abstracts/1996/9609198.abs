  The equivalence of several $SL(3)$ sigma models and their special Abelian
duals is investigated in the two loop order of perturbation theory. The
investigation is based on extracting and comparing various $\beta$ functions of
the original and dual models. The role of the discrete global symmetries is
emphasized.
