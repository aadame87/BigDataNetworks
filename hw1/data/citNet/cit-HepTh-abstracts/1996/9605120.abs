  The non-Abelian Kubo formula is derived from the kinetic theory. That
expression is compared with the one obtained using the eikonal for a
Chern-Simons theory. The multiple time-scale method is used to solve the
non-Abelian Kubo formula, and the damping rate for longitudinal color waves is
computed.
