  We outline the renormalization of the standard model to all orders of
perturbation theory in a way which does not make essential use of a specific
subtraction scheme but is based on the Slavnov-Taylor identity. Physical fields
and parameters are used throughout the paper. The Ward-identity for the global
gauge invariance of the vertex functions is formulated. As an application the
Callan-Symanzik equation is derived.
