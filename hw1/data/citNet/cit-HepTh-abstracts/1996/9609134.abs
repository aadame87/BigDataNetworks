  In this paper we calculate the finite-size corrections of an anisotropic
integrable spin chain, consisting of spins s=1 and s=1/2. The calculations are
done in two regions of the phase diagram with respect to the two couplings
$\bar{c}$ and $\tilde{c}$. In case of conformal invariance we obtain the final
answer for the ground state and its lowest excitations, which generalizes
earlier results.
