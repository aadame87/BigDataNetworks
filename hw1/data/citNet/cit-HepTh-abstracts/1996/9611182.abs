  Relying on the geometrical set up of Special K\"ahler Geometry and
Quaternionic Geometry, which I discussed at length in my Lectures at the 1995
edition of this Spring School, I present here the recently obtained fully
general form of N=2 supergravity with completely arbitrary couplings. This
lagrangian has already been used in the literature to obtain various results:
notably the partial breaking of supersymmetry and various extremal black--hole
solutions. My emphasis, however, is only on providing the reader with a
completely explicit and ready to use component expression of the supergravity
action. All the details of the derivation are omitted but all the definitions
of the items entering the lagrangian and the supersymmetry transformation rules
are given.
