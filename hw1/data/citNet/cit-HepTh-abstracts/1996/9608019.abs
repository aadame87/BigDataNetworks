  Strongly coupled heterotic $E_8\times E_8$ string theory, compactified to
four dimensions on a large Calabi-Yau manifold ${\bf X}$, may represent a
viable candidate for the description of low-energy particle phenomenology. In
this regime, heterotic string theory is adequately described by low-energy
$M$-theory on ${\bf R}^4\times{\bf S}^1/{\bf Z}_2\times{\bf X}$, with the two
$E_8$'s supported at the two boundaries of the world. In this paper we study
the effects of gluino condensation, as a mechanism for supersymmetry breaking
in this $M$-theory regime. We show that when a gluino condensate forms in
$M$-theory, the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry can still be satisfied
locally in the orbifold dimension ${\bf S}^1/{\bf Z}_2$. Supersymmetry is then
only broken by the global topology of the orbifold dimension, in a mechanism
similar to the Casimir effect. This mechanism leads to a natural hierarchy of
scales, and elucidates some aspects of heterotic string theory that might be
relevant to the stabilization of moduli and the smallness of the cosmological
constant.
