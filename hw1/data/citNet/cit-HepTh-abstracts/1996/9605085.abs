  In the process of identifying heterotic and Type $II$ BPS string states with
extremal dilaton black holes, it has been suggested that solutions with
scalar/Maxwell parameters $a=\sqrt{3}$, $1$, $1/\sqrt{3}$ and $0$ correspond to
$1-$, $2-$, $3-$ and $4$-particle bound states at threshold. (For example, the
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is just a superposition of four Kaluza-Klein
black holes). Here we show that not only the masses, electric charges and
magnetic charges but also the spins and supermultiplet structures of the string
states are consistent with this interpretation. Their superspin $L$ corresponds
to the Kerr-type angular momentum and hence only the $L=0$ elementary BPS
states are black holes. Moreover, these results generalize to super $p$-branes
in $D$-dimensions. By constructing multi-centered $p$-brane solitons, the new
super $p$-branes found recently with various values of
$a^2=\Delta-2(p+1)(D-p-3)/(D-2)$ are seen to be bound states of the fundamental
ones with $\Delta=4$.
