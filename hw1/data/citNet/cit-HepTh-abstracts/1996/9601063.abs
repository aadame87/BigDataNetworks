  Quantum mechanics of Hamiltonian (non-dissipative) systems uses Lie algebra
and analytic group (Lie group). In order to describe non-Hamiltonian
(dissipative) systems in quantum theory we need to use non-Lie algebra and
analytic quasigroup (loop).
  The author derives that analog of Lie algebra for quantum non-Hamiltonian
systems is commutant Lie algebra and analog of Lie group for these systems is
analytic commutant associative loop (Valya loop). A commutant Lie algebra is
an algebra such that commutant (a subspace which is generated by all
commutators) is a Lie subalgebra. Valya loop is a non-associative loop such
that the commutant of this loop is associative subloop (group). We prove that
a tangent algebra of Valya loop is a commutant Lie algebra. It is shown that
generalized Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, suggested by the author to describe
quantum non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems, is a commutant Lie algebra. As
the other example of commutant Lie algebra, it is considered a generalized
Poisson algebra for differential 1-forms.
  Note that non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) quantum theory has a broad range of
application for non-critical strings in "coupling constant" phase space and
bosonic string in non-Riemannian (for example, affine-metric) curved space
which are non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems.
