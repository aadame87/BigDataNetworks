  We review the recent exact solution of a matrix model which interpolates
between flat and random lattices. The importance of the results is twofold:
Firstly, we have developed a new large N technique capable of treating a class
of matrix models previously thought to be unsolvable. Secondly, we are able to
make a first precise statement about two-dimensional R^2 gravity. These notes
are based on a lecture given at the Cargese summer school 1995. They contain
some previously unpublished results.
