  As is well known, one can arrange the parameters of the O(N) non-linear sigma
model to reproduce the low energy S-matrix elements of the renormalizable O(N)
linear sigma model. In this note we provide details which are necessary in
order to obtain the off-shell equivalence between the two theories.
