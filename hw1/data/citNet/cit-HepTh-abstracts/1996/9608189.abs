  A method is presented, and used, for determining any heat-kernel coefficient
for the form-valued Laplacian on the $D$-ball as an explicit function of
dimension and form order. The calculation is offerred as a particular
application of a general technique developed earlier for obtaining heat-kernel
coefficients on a bounded generalised cone which involves writing the sphere
and ball \zfs, and coefficients, in terms of Barnes \zfs\ and generalised
Bernoulli polynomials. Functional determinants are computed. Spinors are also
treated by the general method.
