  A complete treatment of the (2,2) NSR string in flat (2+2) dimensional
space-time is given, from the formal path integral over N=2 super Riemann
surfaces to the computational recipe for amplitudes at any loop or gauge
instanton number. We perform in detail the superconformal gauge fixing, discuss
the spectral flow, and analyze the supermoduli space with emphasis on the gauge
moduli. Background gauge field configurations in all instanton sectors are
constructed. We develop chiral bosonization on punctured higher-genus surfaces
in the presence of gauge moduli and instantons. The BRST cohomology is
recapitulated, with a new space-time interpretation for picture-changing. We
point out two ways of combining left- and right-movers, which lead to different
three-point functions.
