  We investigate a generalized non-linear O(3) $\sigma$-model in three space
dimensions where the fields are maps $S^3 \mapsto S^2$. Such maps are
classified by a homotopy invariant called the Hopf number which takes integer
values. The model exhibits soliton solutions of closed vortex type which have a
lower topological bound on their energies. We explicitly compute the fields for
topological charge 1 and 2 and discuss their shapes and binding energies. The
effect of an additional potential term is considered and an approximation is
given for the spectrum of slowly rotating solitons.
