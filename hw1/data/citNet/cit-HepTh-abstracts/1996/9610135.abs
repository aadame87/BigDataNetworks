  An approach based on considerations of the non-classical energy momentum
tensor outside the event horizon of a black hole provides additional physical
insight into the nature of discrete quantum hair on black holes and its effect
on black hole temperature. Our analysis both extends previous work based on the
Euclidean action techniques, and corrects an omission in that work. We also
raise several issues related to the effects of instantons on black hole
thermodynamics and the relation between these effects and results in two
dimensional quantum field theory.
