  Multi-instanton contributions to QCD sum rules for the pion are investigated
within a framework which models the QCD vacuum as an instanton liquid. It is
shown that in singular gauge the sum of planar diagrams in leading order of the
$1/N_{c}$ expansion provides similar results as the effective single-instanton
contribution. These effects are also analysed in regular gauge. Our findings
confirm that at large distances the correlator functions are more adequately
described in the singular gauge rather than in the regular one.
