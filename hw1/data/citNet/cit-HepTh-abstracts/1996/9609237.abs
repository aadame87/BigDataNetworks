  We study the large-N limit of a class of matrix models for dually weighted
triangulated random surfaces using character expansion techniques. We show that
for various choices of the weights of vertices of the dynamical triangulation
the model can be solved by resumming the Itzykson-Di Francesco formula over
congruence classes of Young tableau weights modulo three. From this we show
that the large-N limit implies a non-trivial correspondence with models of
random surfaces weighted with only even coordination number vertices. We
examine the critical behaviour and evaluation of observables and discuss their
interrelationships in all models. We obtain explicit solutions of the model for
simple choices of vertex weightings and use them to show how the matrix model
reproduces features of the random surface sum. We also discuss some general
properties of the large-N character expansion approach as well as potential
physical applications of our results.
