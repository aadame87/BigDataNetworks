  A path-integral quantization on a homogeneous space G/H is proposed based on
the guiding principle `first lift to G and then project to G/H'. It is then
shown that this principle gives a simple procedure to obtain the inequivalent
quantizations (superselection sectors) along with the holonomy factor (induced
gauge field) found earlier by algebraic approaches. We also prove that the
resulting matrix-valued path-integral is physically equivalent to the
scalar-valued path-integral derived in the Dirac approach, and thereby present
a unified viewpoint to discuss the basic features of quantizing on $G/H$
obtained in various approaches so far.
