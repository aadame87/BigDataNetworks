  We construct a new extension of the Poincar\'e superalgebra in eleven
dimensions which contains super one-, two- and five-form charges. The latter
two are associated with the supermembrane and the superfivebrane of M-theory.
Using the Maurer-Cartan equations of this algebra, we construct closed super
seven-forms in a number of ways. The pull-back of the corresponding super
six-forms are candidate superfivebrane Wess-Zumino terms, which are manifestly
supersymmetric, and contain coordinates associated with the new charges.
