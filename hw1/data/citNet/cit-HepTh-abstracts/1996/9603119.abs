  We propose the use of Heaviside transform with respect to the quark mass to
investigate dynamical aspects of QCD. We show that at large momentum transfer
the transformed propagator of massive quarks behaves softly and thus the
dominant effect of explicit chiral symmetry breaking disappears through
Heaviside transform. This suggests that the massless approximation would be
more convenient to do in the transformed quantity than in the original one. As
an example of explicit approximation, we estimate the massless value of the
quark condensate.
