  I introduce a class of string constructions based on asymmetric orbifolds
leading to level two models. In particular, I derive in detail various models
with gauge groups $E_6$ and SO(10), including a four generation $E_6$ model
with two adjoint representations. The occurrence of multiple adjoint
representations is a generic feature of the construction. In the course of
describing this approach, I will address the problem of twist phases in higher
twisted sectors of asymmetric orbifolds.
