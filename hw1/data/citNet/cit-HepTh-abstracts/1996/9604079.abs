  We study the local conserved charges in integrable spin chains of the XYZ
type with nontrivial boundary conditions. The general structure of these
charges consists of a bulk part, whose density is identical to that of a
periodic chain, and a boundary part. In contrast with the periodic case, only
charges corresponding to interactions of even number of spins exist for the
open chain. Hence, there are half as many charges in the open case as in the
closed case. For the open spin-1/2 XY chain, we derive the explicit expressions
of all the charges. For the open spin-1/2 XXX chain, several lowest order
charges are presented and a general method of obtaining the boundary terms is
indicated. In contrast with the closed case, the XXX charges cannot be
described in terms of a Catalan tree pattern.
