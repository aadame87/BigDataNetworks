  We study the cosmological implications of the one-loop terms in the string
expansion. In particular, we find non-singular solutions which interpolate
between a contracting universe and an expanding universe, and show that these
solutions provide a mechanism for removing the initial conditions problem
peculiar to spatially closed FRW cosmologies. In addition, we perform numerical
calculations to show that the non-singular cosmologies do not require a careful
choice of initial conditions, and estimate the likely magnitude of higher order
terms in the string expansion.
