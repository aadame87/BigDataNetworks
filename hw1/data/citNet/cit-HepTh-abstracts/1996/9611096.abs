  The spherically and cylindrically symmetric solutions of the $SU(3)$ Yang -
Mills theory are obtained. The corresponding gauge potential has the confining
properties. It is supposed that: a) the spherically symmetric solution is a
field distribution of the classical ``quark'' and in this sense it is similar
to the Coulomb potential; b) the cylindrically symmetric solution describes a
classical field ``string'' (flux tube) between two ``quarks''. It is noticed
that these solutions are typically for the classical $SU(3)$ Yang - Mills
theory in contradiction to monopole that is an exceptional solution. This
allows to conclude that the confining properties of the classical $SU(3)$ Yang
- Mills theory are general properties of this theory.
