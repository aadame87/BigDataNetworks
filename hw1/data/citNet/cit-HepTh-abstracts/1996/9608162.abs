  We give several pieces of evidence to show that extremal black holes cannot
be obtained as limits of non-extremal black holes. We review arguments in the
literature showing that the entropy of extremal black holes is zero, while that
of near-extremal ones obey the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. However, from the
counting of degeneracy of quantum (BPS) states of string theory the entropy of
extremal stringy black holes obeys the area law. An attempt is made to
reconcile these arguments.
