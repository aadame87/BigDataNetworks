  The problem of asymptotic density of quantum states of fundamental extended
objects is revised in detail. We argue that in the near-extremal regime the
fundamental $p$-brane approach can yield a microscopic interpretation of the
black hole entropy. The asymptotic behavior of partition functions, associated
with the $p$-branes, and the near-extremal entropy of five-dimensional black
holes are explicitly calculated.
