  We construct a (1,2) heterotic string with gauge symmetry and determine its
particle spectrum. This theory has a local N=1 worldsheet supersymmetry for
left movers and a local N=2 worldsheet supersymmetry for right movers and
describes particles in either two or three space-time dimensions. We show that
fermionizing the bosons of the compactified N=1 space leads to a particle
spectrum which has nonabelian gauge symmetry. The fermionic formulation of the
theory corresponds to a dimensional reduction of self dual Yang Mills. We also
give a worldsheet action for the theory and calculate the one-loop path
integral.
