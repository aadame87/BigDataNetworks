  In this paper we continue our investigation of the N = 2 supergravity models,
where scalar fields of hypermultiplets parameterize the nonsymmetric
quaternionic manifolds. Using the results of our previous paper, where we have
given an explicit construction for the Lagrangians and the supertransformations
and, in-particular, the known global symmetries of the Lagrangians, we consider
here the switching on the gauge interaction. We show that in this type of
models there appears to be possible to have spontaneous supersymmetry breaking
with two different scales and without a cosmological term. Moreover, such a
breaking could lead to the generation of the Yukawa interactions of the scalar
and spinor fields from the hypermultiplets which are absent in other known
models.
