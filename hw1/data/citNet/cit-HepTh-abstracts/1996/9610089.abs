  We study dynamical gaugino condensation in superstring effective theories
using the linear multiplet representation for the dilaton superfield. An
interesting necessary condition for the dilaton to be stabilized, which was
first derived in generic models of static gaugino condensation, is shown to
hold for generic models of dynamical gaugino condensation. We also point out
that it is stringy non-perturbative effects that stabilize the dilaton and
allow dynamical supersymmetry breaking via the field-theoretical
non-perturbative effect of gaugino condensation. As a typical example, a toy
S-dual model of a dynamical E_8 condensate is constructed and the dilaton is
explicitly shown to be stabilized with broken supersymmetry and (fine-tuned)
vanishing cosmological constant.
