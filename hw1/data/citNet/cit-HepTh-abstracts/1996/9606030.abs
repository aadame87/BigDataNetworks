  Several gravitational string backgrounds can be interpreted as 2-dim soliton
solutions of reduced axion-dilaton gravity. They include black-hole and
worm-hole solutions as well as cosmological models with an exact conformal
field theory description. We illustrate the use of gravisolitons for the
particular example of Nappi-Witten universe which is thus "created" from flat
space by soliton dressing. We also make some general comments about the status
of gravisolitons in comparison to soliton solutions of other 2-dim integrable
systems without gravity. (Contribution to the proceedings of the 2nd
