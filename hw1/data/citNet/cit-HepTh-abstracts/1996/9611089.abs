  We show that locally Lorentz invariant, third order, topological massive
gravity can not be broken down neither to the local diffeomorphism subgroup nor
to the rigid Poincar\'e group. On the other hand, the recently formulated,
locally diffeomorphism invariant, second order massive triadic (translational)
Chern-Simons gravity breaks down on rigid Minkowski space to a double massive
spin-two system. This flat double massive action is the uniform spin-two
generalization of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca system which one is left with
after U(1) abelian gauge invariance breaks down in the presence of a sextic
Higgs potential.
