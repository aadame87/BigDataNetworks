  A geometrical approach in the non-symmetric connection framework is employed
to examine the issue of higher order $\alpha'$ corrections to D=10 type
IIB superstring backgrounds with a covariantly constant null Killing isometry
and non-zero Ramond-Ramond field content. These describe generalized
supersymmetric string waves and were obtained recently by us through the
S-duality transformation of purely NS-NS plane wave backgrounds. We find that
the backgrounds are exact subject to the existence of certain field
redefinitions and provided certain restrictive conditions are satisfied.
