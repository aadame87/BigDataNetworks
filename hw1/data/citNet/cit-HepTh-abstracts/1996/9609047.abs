  The low-density expansion for a homogeneous interacting Bose gas at zero
temperature can be formulated as an expansion in powers of $\sqrt{\rho a^3}$,
where $\rho$ is the number density and $a$ is the S-wave scattering length.
Logarithms of $\rho a^3$ appear in the coefficients of the expansion. We show
that these logarithms are determined by the renormalization properties of the
effective field theory that describes the scattering of atoms at zero density.
The leading logarithm is determined by the renormalization of the pointlike $3
\to 3$ scattering amplitude.
