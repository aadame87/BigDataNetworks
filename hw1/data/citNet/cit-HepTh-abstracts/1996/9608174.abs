  We propose a continuous Wick rotation for Dirac, Majorana and Weyl spinors
from Minkowski spacetime to Euclidean space which treats fermions on the same
footing as bosons. The result is a recipe to construct a supersymmetric
Euclidean theory from any supersymmetric Minkowski theory. This Wick rotation
is identified as a complex Lorentz boost in a five-dimensional space and acts
uniformly on bosons and fermions. For Majorana and Weyl spinors our approach is
reminiscent of the traditional Osterwalder Schrader approach in which spinors
are ``doubled'' but the action is not hermitean. However, for Dirac spinors our
work provides a link to the work of Schwinger and Zumino in which hermiticity
is maintained but spinors are not doubled. Our work differs from recent work by
Mehta since we introduce no external metric and transform only the basic
fields.
