  Taking into account a neutral massive scalar field minimally coupled to
gravity, in a Robertson-Walker metric, it is shown that when the final state is
connected with the initial one by means of a Bogoliubov transformation, which
does not include the single-mode rotation operator, the mean value of created
particles is conserved. When the rotation operator is considered, it is still
possible to use the approach of single-mode squeezed operators and get the
entropy as the logarithm of the created particles.
