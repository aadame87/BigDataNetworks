  Using stochastic quantization method we derive gauge-invariant equations,
connecting multilocal vacuum correlators of nonperturbative field
configurations immersed into the quantum background. Three alternative methods
of stochastic regularization of these equations are suggested, and the
corresponding regularized propagators of a background field are obtained in the
lowest order of perturbation theory.
