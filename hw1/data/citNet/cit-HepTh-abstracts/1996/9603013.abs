  We study the interaction of non-Abelian topological $BF$ theories defined on
two dimensional manifolds with point sources carrying non-Abelian charges. We
identify the most general solution for the field equations on simply and
multiply connected two-manifolds. Taking the particular choice of the so-called
extended Poincar\'e group as the gauge group we discuss how recent discussions
of two dimensional gravity models do fit in this formalism.
