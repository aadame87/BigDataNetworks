  Scale to Electroweak Scale"

  We discuss spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in $N=2$ globally
supersymmetric theories describing abelian vector multiplets. The most general
form of the action admits, in addition to the usual Fayet-Iliopoulos term, a
magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term for the auxiliary components of dual vector
multiplets. In a generic case, this leads to a spontaneous breakdown of one of
the two supersymmetries. In some cases however, dyon condensation restores
$N=2$ SUSY vacuum. This talk is based on the work done in collaboration with H.
Partouche \cite{apt}.
