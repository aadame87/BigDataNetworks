Title: Topological Sectors and Gauge invariance in massive Vector-Tensor
  Theories in D >=4
Authors: Pio J. Arias and Lorenzo Leal
Comments: 15 pages in LaTeX. This is a revised version. The BRST invariant
  covariant effective action and partition function for the 3+1 BF theory are
  explicity calculated, static solutions for special sources of the Proca and
  TM model are included and compared, some references added

  A family of locally equivalent models is considered. They can be taken as a
generalization to $d+1$ dimensions of the Topological Massive and ``Self-dual''
models in 2+1 dimensions. The corresponding 3+1 models are analized in detail.
It is shown that one model can be seen as a gauge fixed version of the other,
and their space of classical solutions differs in a topological sector
represented by the classical solutions of a pure BF model. The topological
sector can be gauged out on cohomologically trivial base manifolds but on
general settings it may be responsible of the difference in the long distance
behaviour of the models. The presence of this topological sector appears
explicitly in the partition function of the theories. The generalization of
this models to higher dimensions is shown to be straightfoward.
