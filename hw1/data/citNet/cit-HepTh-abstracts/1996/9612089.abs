  Multidimensional gravitational model on the manifold $M = M_0 \times
\prod_{i=1}^{n} M_i$, where $M_i$ are Einstein spaces ($i \geq 1$), is
considered. The action contains $m = 2^n -1$ dilatonic scalar fields
$\phi^I$ and $m$ (antisymmetric) forms $A^I$. When all fields and scale
factors of the metric depend (essentially) on the point of $M_0$ and any $A^I$
is "proportional" to the volume form of submanifold $M_{i_1} \times ...
\times M_{i_k}$, $1 \leq i_1 < ... < i_k \leq n$, the sigma-model
representation is obtained. A family of "Majumdar-Papapetrou type" solutions
are obtained, when all $M_{\nu}$ are Ricci-flat. A special class of solutions
(related to the solution of some Diophantus equation on dimensions of
$M_{\nu}$) is singled out. Some examples of intersecting p-branes (e.g.
solution with seven Euclidean 2-branes for D = 11 supergravity) are
considered.}
