Title: Twisted Homotopy: A Group Theoretic Approach

  After summarising the physical approach leading to twisted homotopy and
after developing the cohomological approach further with respect to our
previous work we propose a third alternative approach to twisted homotopy
based on group theoretic considerations. In this approach the fundamental
group $\Pi (m) $ isomorphic to Z which describes homotopic loops on the
punctured plane$ R^2/(0) $ is enhanced in a special way to the continuous
SO(2) group . This is performed by letting the parameter of the group $ m
\rightarrow \lambda $ while keeping its generator unchanged .It is shown that
such non-trivial procedure has the effect of introducing well defined
self-interactions among loops which are at the basis of twisted homotopy where
the angle $ \lambda $ plays the role of the self coupling constant.
