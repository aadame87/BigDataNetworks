  We develop an efficient technique to compute anomalies in supersymmetric
theories by combining the so-called nonlocal regularization method and
superspace techniques. To illustrate the method we apply it to a four
dimensional toy model with potentially anomalous N=1 supersymmetry and prove
explicitly that in this model all the candidate supersymmetry anomalies have
vanishing coefficients at the one-loop level.
