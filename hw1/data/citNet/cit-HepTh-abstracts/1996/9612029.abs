  We present an elementary derivation of the soliton-like solutions in the
$A_n^{(1)}$ Toda models which is alternative to the previously used Hirota
method. The solutions of the underlying linear problem corresponding to the
N-solitons are calculated. This enables us to obtain explicit expression for
the element which by dressing group action, produces a generic soliton
solution. In the particular example of monosolitons we suggest a relation to
the vertex operator formalism, previously used by Olive, Turok and Underwood.
Our results can also be considered as generalization of the approach to the
sine-Gordon solitons, proposed by Babelon and Bernard.
