  We apply an earlier formulated programme for quantization of nonabelian gauge
theories to one-flavour chromodynamics. This programme consists in a complete
reformulation of the functional integral in terms of gauge invariant
quantities. For the model under consideration two types of gauge invariants
occur -- quantities, which are bilinear in quarks and antiquarks (mesons) and a
matrix-valued covector field, which is bilinear in quarks, antiquarks and their
covariant derivatives. This covector field is linear in the original gauge
potential, and can be, therefore, considered as the gauge potential ``dressed''
in a gauge invariant way with matter. Thus, we get a complete bosonization of
the theory. The strong interaction is described by a highly non-linear
effective action obtained after integrating out quarks and gluons from the
functional integral. All constructions are done consequently on the quantum
level, where quarks and antiquarks are anticommuting objects. Our quantization
procedure circumvents the Gribov ambiguity.
