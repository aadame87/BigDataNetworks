  A new formulation of $c\leq 1$ matter coupled to 2D gravity is proposed. This
model, being closely analogous to one in the Polyakov light-cone gauge,
possesses well defined global properties which allow to calculate correlation
functions. As an example, the three point correlation functions of discrete
states are found.
