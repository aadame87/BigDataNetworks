  In this paper we explicitly prove that Integrable System solved by Quantum
Inverse Scattering Method can be described with the pure algebraic object
(Universal R-matrix) and proper algebraic representations. Namely, on the
example of the Quantum Volterra model we construct L-operator and fundamental
R--matrix from universal R--matrix for Quantum Affine $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$
Algebra and q-oscillator representation for it. In this way there exists an
equivalence between the Integrable System with symmetry algebra A and the
representation of this algebra.
