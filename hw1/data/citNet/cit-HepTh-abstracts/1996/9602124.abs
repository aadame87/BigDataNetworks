  From the postulate that a black hole can be replaced by a boundary on the
apparent horizon with suitable boundary conditions, an unconventional scenario
for the evolution emerges. Only an insignificant fraction of energy of order
$(mG)^{-1}$ is radiated out. The outgoing wave carries a very small part of the
quantum mechanical information of the collapsed body, the bulk of the
information remaining in the final stable black hole geometry.
