  We apply a recently proposed path-integral approach to non-local bosonization
to a Thirring-like system modeling non-relativistic massless particles
interacting with localized fermionic impurities. We consider forward scattering
processes described by symmetric potentials including interactions between
charge, current, spin and spin-current densities. In the general
(spin-flipping) problem we obtain an effective action for the collective modes
of the model at T = 0, containing WZW-type terms. When spin-flipping processes
are disregarded the structure of the action is considerably simplified,
allowing us to derive exact expressions for the dispersion relations of
collective modes and two point fermionic correlation functions as functionals
of the potentials. Finally, as an example, we compute the momentum distribution
for the case in which electrons and impurities are coupled through spin and
spin-current densities only. The formulae we get suggest that our formalism
could be useful in order to seek for a mechanism able to restore Fermi liquid
behavior.
