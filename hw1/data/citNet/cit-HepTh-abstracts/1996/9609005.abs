  In this article we examine the appearance of tensionless strings in M-Theory.
We subsequently interpret these tensionless strings in a String Theory context.
In particular, we examine tensionless strings appearing in M-Theory on $S^{1}$,
M-Theory on $S^{1} / {\bf Z}_{2}$, and M-Theory on $T^{2}$; we then interpret
the appearance of such strings in a String Theory context. Then we reverse this
process and examine the appearance of some tensionless strings in String
Theory. Subsequently we interpret these tensionless strings in a M-Theory
context.
