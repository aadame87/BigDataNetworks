  We consider the quantum correction to the Lagrangean by the massless free
boson in the curved background in three dimensions where one of the coordinates
is periodic. The correction term is given by an expansion of the metric with
respect to the derivative and the first term expresses to the usual Casimir
energy. As an application, we investigate the change of the geometry in three
dimensional black hole due to the quantum effect and we show that the geometry
becomes like that of the Reissner-Nordstr\o m solution.
