  The bootstrap programme for finding exact S-matrices of integrable quantum
field theories with N=1 supersymmetry is investigated. New solutions are found
which have the same fusing data as bosonic theories related to the classical
affine Lie algebras. When the states correspond to a spinor spot of the Dynkin
diagram they are kinks which carry a non-zero topological charge. Using these
results, the S-matrices of the supersymmetric O($2n$) sigma model and
sine-Gordon model can be shown to close under the bootstrap.
