  We formulate in terms of the quantum inverse scattering method the exact
solution of a $spl(2|1)$ invariant vertex model recently introduced in the
literature. The corresponding transfer matrix is diagonalized by using the
algebraic (nested) Bethe ansatz approach. The ground state structure is
investigated and we argue that a Pokrovsky-Talapov transition is favored for
certain value of the 4-dimensional $spl(2|1)$ parameter.
