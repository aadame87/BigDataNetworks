  Renormalization factors are most easily extracted by going to the massless
limit of the quantum field theory and retaining only a single momentum scale.
We derive factors and renormalized Green functions to all orders in
perturbation theory for rainbow graphs and vertex (or scattering diagrams) at
zero momentum transfer, in the context of dimensional renormalization, and we
prove that the correct anomalous dimensions for those processes emerge in the
limit D -> 4.
