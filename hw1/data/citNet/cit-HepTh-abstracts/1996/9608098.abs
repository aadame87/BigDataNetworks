  The idea of biased symmetries to avoid or alleviate cosmological problems
caused by the appearance of some topological defects is familiar in the context
of domain walls, where the defect statistics lend themselves naturally to a
percolation theory description, and for cosmic strings, where the proportion of
infinite strings can be varied or disappear entirely depending on the bias in
the symmetry. In this paper we measure the initial configurational statistics
of a network of string defects after a symmetry-breaking phase transition with
initial bias in the symmetry of the ground state. Using an improved algorithm,
which is useful for a more general class of self-interacting walks on an
infinite lattice, we extend the work in \cite{MHKS} to better statistics and a
different ground state manifold, namely $\R P^2$, and explore various different
discretisations. Within the statistical errors, the critical exponents of the
Hagedorn transition are found to be quite possibly universal and identical to
the critical exponents of three-dimensional bond or site percolation. This
improves our understanding of the percolation theory description of defect
statistics after a biased phase transition, as proposed in \cite{MHKS}. We also
find strong evidence that the existence of infinite strings in the Vachaspati
Vilenkin algorithm is generic to all (string-bearing) vacuum manifolds, all
discretisations thereof, and all regular three-dimensional lattices.
