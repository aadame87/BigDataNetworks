Title: A New Nonperturbative Approach to QCD by BF Theory
Authors: Maurizio Martellini, Mauro Zeni, Francesco Fucito

  Congress, Moscow, June 1996
\\
  Yang-Mills theory in the first order formalism appears as the deformation of
a topological field theory, the pure BF theory. In this approach new non local
observables are inherited from the topological theory and the operators
entering the t'Hooft algebra find an explicit realization. A calculation of the
{\it vev}'s of these operators is performed in the Abelian Projection gauge.
