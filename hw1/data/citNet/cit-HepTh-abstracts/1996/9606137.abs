  We give a lattice theory treatment of certain one and two dimensional quantum
field theories. In one dimension we construct a combinatorial version of a
non-trivial field theory on the circle which is of some independent interest in
itself while in two dimensions we consider a field theory on a toroidal
triangular lattice. We take a continuous spin Gaussian model on a toroidal
triangular lattice with periods $L_0$ and $L_1$ where the spins carry a
representation of the fundamental group of the torus labeled by phases $u_0$
and $u_1$. We compute the {\it exact finite size and lattice corrections}, to
the partition function $Z$, for arbitrary mass $m$ and phases $u_i$. Summing
$Z^{-1/2}$ over a specified set of phases gives the corresponding result for
the Ising model on a torus. An interesting property of the model is that the
limits $m\rightarrow0$ and $u_i\rightarrow0$ do not commute. Also when $m=0$
the model exhibits a {\it vortex critical phase} when at least one of the $u_i$
is non-zero. In the continuum or scaling limit, for arbitrary $m$, the finite
size corrections to $-\ln Z$ are {\it modular invariant} and for the critical
phase are given by elliptic theta functions. In the cylinder limit
$L_1\rightarrow\infty$ the ``cylinder charge'' $c(u_0,m^2L_0^2)$ is a
non-monotonic function of $m$ that ranges from $2(1+6u_0(u_0-1))$ for $m=0$ to
zero for $m\rightarrow\infty$ but from which one can determine the central
charge $c$. The study of the continuum limit of these field theories provides a
kind of quantum theoretic analog of the link between certain combinatorial and
analytic topological quantities.
