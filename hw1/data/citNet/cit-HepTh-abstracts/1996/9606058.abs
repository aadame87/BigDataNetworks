  We find a general p-1-brane solution to supergravity coupled to a p+1-form
field strength using the ``standard ansatz'' for the fields. In addition to the
well-known elementary and solitonic p-1-brane solutions, which are the only
ones preserving half of the supersymmetry (for the cases where the
supersymmetry transformations are known), there are other possibilities, the
most interesting of which is an elementary type~I string solution with a
non-dynamical string source and no conserved charge.
