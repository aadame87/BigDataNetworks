  We give a representation, in terms of iterated Mellin-Barnes integrals, of
periods on multi-moduli Calabi-Yau manifolds arising in superstring theory.
Using this representation and the theory of multidimensional residues, we
present a method for analytic continuation of the fundamental period in the
form of Horn series.
