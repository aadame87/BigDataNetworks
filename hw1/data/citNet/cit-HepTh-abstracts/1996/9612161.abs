  We investigate the exact results of the Navier-Stokes equations using the
methods developed by Polyakov. It is shown that when the velocity field and the
density are not independent, the Burgers equation is obtained leading to exact
N-point generating functions of velocity field. Our results show that, the
operator product expansion has to be generalized both in the absence and the
presence of pressure. We find a method to determine the extra terms in the
operator product expansion and derive its coefficients and find the first
correction to probablity distribuation function. In the general case and for
small pressure, we solve the problem perturbatively and find the probablity
distribuation function for the Navier-Stokes equation in the mean field
approximation.
