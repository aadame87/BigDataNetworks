  Using the recent advances in our understanding of non-perturbative aspects of
type II strings we show how non-trivial exact results for $N=2$ quantum field
theories can be reduced to T-dualities of string theory. This is done by
constructing a local geometric realization of quantum field theories together
with a local application of mirror symmetry. This construction is not based on
any duality conjecture and thus reduces non-trivial quantum field theory
results to much better understood T-dualities of type II strings. Moreover it
can be used in principle to construct in a systematic way the vacuum structure
for arbitrary $N=2$ gauge theories with matter representations.
