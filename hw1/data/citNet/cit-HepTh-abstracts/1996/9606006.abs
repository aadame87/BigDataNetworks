  It is argued that quantum gravity has an interpretation as a topological
field theory provided a certain constraint from the path intergral measure is
respected. The constraint forces us to couple gauge and matter fields to
gravity for space - time dimensions different from 3. We then discuss possible
models which may be relevant to our universe.
