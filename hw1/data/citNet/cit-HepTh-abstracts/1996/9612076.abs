  We have found the entropy of N=2 extreme black holes associated with general
Calabi-Yau moduli space. We show that for arbitrary d_{ABC} and black hole
charges the entropy-area formula depends on combinations of these charges and
parameters d_{ABC}. These combinations are the solutions of the simple system
of algebraic equations. We gave a few examples of particular Calabi-Yau moduli
space for which this system has an explicit solution. For special case when one
of black hole charges is equal to zero (p^0=0) the solution always exists.
