  We obtain the closed form of the Picard-Fuchs equations for $N=2$
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with classical Lie gauge groups. For a gauge
group of rank $r$, there are $r-1$ regular and an exceptional differential
equations. We describe the series solutions of the Picard-Fuchs equations in
the semi-classical regime.
