  The heat kernel $M_{xy} = <x\mid exp [ 1/\sqrt{g} \partial_\mu
g^{\mu\nu} \sqrt{g} \partial_\nu ]t \mid y>$ is of central importance
when studying the propagation of a scalar particle in curved space. It is quite
convenient to analyze this quantity in terms of classical variables by use of
the quantum mechanical path integral; regrettably it is not entirely clear how
this path integral can be mathematically well defined in curved space. An
alternate approach to studying the heat kernel in terms of classical variables
was introduced by Onofri. This technique is shown to be applicable to problems
in curved space; an unambiguous expression for $M_{xy}$ is obtained which
involves functional derivatives of a classical quantity. We illustrate how this
can be used by computing $M_{xx}$ to lowest order in the curvature scalar R.
