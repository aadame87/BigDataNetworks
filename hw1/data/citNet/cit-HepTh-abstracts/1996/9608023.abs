  The act of implementing non-Abelian duality in two dimensional sigma models
results unavoidably in an additional reducible symmetry. The Batalin-Vilkovisky
formalism is employed to handle this new symmetry. Valuable lessons are learnt
here with respect to non-Abelian duality. We emphasise, in particular, the
effects of the ghost sector corresponding to this symmetry on non-Abelian
duality.
