  We argue that correct account of the quantum properties of macroscopic
objects which form reference frames (RF) demand the change of the standard
space-time picture accepted in Quantum Mechanics. Galilean or Lorentz
space-time transformations are shown to become incorrect in this case and for
the description of transformations between different RF the special quantum
space-time transformations are introduced. Consequently it results in the
generalised Schrodinger equation which depends on the observer mass. The
experiments with macroscopic coherent states are proposed in which this effects
can be tested.
