  Higher order conservation laws, associated with conserved antisymmetric
tensors $j^{\mu_1 ... \mu_k}$ fulfilling $\partial_{\mu_1} j^{\mu_1 ...
\mu_k} \approx 0$, are shown to define rigid symmetries of the master equation.
They thus lead to independent Ward identities which are explicitly derived.
