  Using analyticity of the vacuum wave-functional under complex scalings, the
vacuum of a quantum field theory may be reconstructed from a derivative
expansion valid for slowly varying fields. This enables the eigenvalue problem
for the Hamiltonian to be reduced to algebraic equations. Applied to Yang-Mills
theory this expansion leads to a confining force between quarks.
