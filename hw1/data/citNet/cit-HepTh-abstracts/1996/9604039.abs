  We discuss the properties of an ideal relativistic gas of events possessing
Bose-Einstein statistics. We find that the mass spectrum of such a system is
bounded by $\mu \leq m\leq 2M/\mu _K,$ where $\mu $ is the usual chemical
potential, $M$ is an intrinsic dimensional scale parameter for the motion of an
event in space-time, and $\mu _K$ is an additional mass potential of the
ensemble. For the system including both particles and antiparticles, with
nonzero chemical potential $\mu ,$ the mass spectrum is shown to be bounded by
$|\mu |\leq m\leq 2M/\mu _K,$ and a special type of high-temperature
Bose-Einstein condensation can occur. We study this Bose-Einstein condensation,
and show that it corresponds to a phase transition from the sector of
continuous relativistic mass distributions to a sector in which the boson mass
distribution becomes sharp at a definite mass $M/\mu _K.$ This phenomenon
provides a mechanism for the mass distribution of the particles to be sharp at
some definite value.
