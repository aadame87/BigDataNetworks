  We review the status of domain walls in $N=1$ supergravity theories for both
the vacuum domain walls as well as dilatonic domain walls. We concentrate on a
systematic analysis of the nature of the space-time in such domain wall
backgrounds and the special role that supersymmetry is playing in determining
the nature of such configurations.
