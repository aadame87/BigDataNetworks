  We show that the open membrane action on $T^3\times S^1/Z^2$ is equivalent to
the closed membrane action on K3. The main difference between the two actions
is that one generates the KK modes in the worldvolume action which is the
strong coupling limit of \IIA\ while the other action generates the KK modes in
a worldsheet action. Thus explaining membrane-string duality in D=7, which
naturally leads to string-string duality in D=6.
