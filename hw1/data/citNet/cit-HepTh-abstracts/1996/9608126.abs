  For an extreme charged black hole some scalars take on a fixed value at the
horizon determined by the charges alone. We call them fixed scalars. We find
the absorption cross section for a low frequency wave of a fixed scalar to be
proportional to the square of the frequency. This implies a strong suppression
of the Hawking radiation near extremality. We compute the coefficient of
proportionality for a specific model.
