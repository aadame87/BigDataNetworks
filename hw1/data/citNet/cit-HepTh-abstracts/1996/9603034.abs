  We consider supersymmetric Sp(2N) gauge theories with F matter fields in the
defining representation, one matter field in the adjoint representation, and no
superpotential. We construct a sequence of dual descriptions of this theory
using the dualities of Seiberg combined with the ``deconfinement'' method
introduced by Berkooz. Our duals hint at a new non-perturbative phenomenon that
seems to be taking place at asymptotically low energies in these theories: for
small F some of the degrees of freedom form massless, non-interacting bound
states while the theory remains in an interacting non-Abelian Coulomb phase.
This phenomenon is the result of strong coupling gauge dynamics in the original
description, but has a simple classical origin in the dual descriptions. The
methods used for constructing these duals can be generalized to any model
involving arbitrary 2-index tensor representations of Sp(2N), SO(N), or SU(N)
groups.
