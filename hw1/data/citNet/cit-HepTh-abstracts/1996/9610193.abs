  Using methods of high performance computing, we have found indications that
knotlike structures appear as stable finite energy solitons in a realistic 3+1
dimensional model. We have explicitly simulated the unknot and trefoil
configurations, and our results suggest that all torus knots appear as
solitons. Our observations open new theoretical possibilities in scenarios
where stringlike structures appear, including physics of fundamental
interactions and early universe cosmology. In nematic liquid crystals and 3He
superfluids such knotted solitons might actually be observed.
