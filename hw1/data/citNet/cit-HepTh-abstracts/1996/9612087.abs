  We calculate the potential between various configurations of membranes and
gravitons in M(atrix) theory. The computed potentials agree with the short
distance potentials between corresponding 2-branes and 0-brane configurations
in Type IIA string theory, bound to a large number of 0-branes to account for
the boost to the infinite momentum frame. We show that, due to the large boost,
these type IIA configurations are almost supersymmetric, so that the short and
long distance potentials actually agree. Thus the M(atrix) theory is able to
reproduce correct long distance behavior in these cases.
