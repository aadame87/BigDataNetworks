  After emphasizing the importance of obtaining a space-time understanding of
black hole entropy, we further elaborate our program to identify the degrees of
freedom of black holes with classical space-time degrees of freedom. The
Cveti\v{c}-Youm dyonic black holes are discussed in some detail as an example.
In this example hair degrees of freedom transforming as an effective string can
be identified explicitly. We discuss issues concerning charge quantization,
identification of winding, and tension renormalization that arise in counting
the associated degrees of freedom. The possibility of other forms of hair in
this example, and the prospects for making contact with D-brane ideas, are
briefly considered.
