  In this paper we numerically demonstrate that massless two-dimensional QCD is
not integrable. To this aim, we explicitly solve the 't Hooft integral equation
for bound states by an adaptive spline procedure, and compute the decay
amplitudes. These amplitudes significantly differ from zero except in all cases
in which the decay also produces a pion.
