  Dilatation, i.e. scale, symmetry in the presence of the dilaton in Minkowski
space is derived from diffeomorphism symmetry in curved spacetime,
incorporating the volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. The conditions for scale
invariance are derived and their relation to conformal invariance is examined.
In the presence of the dilaton scale invariance automatically guarantees
conformal invariance due to diffeomorphism symmetry. Low energy scale-invariant
phenomenological Lagrangians are derived in terms of dilaton-dressed fields,
which are identified as the fields satisfying the usual scaling properties. The
notion of spontaneous scale symmetry breaking is defined in the presence of the
dilaton. In this context, possible phenomenological implications are advocated
and by computing the dilaton mass the idea of PCDC (partially conserved
dilatation current) is further explored.
