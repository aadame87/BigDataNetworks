  We compute the non--trivial infrared $\phi^4_3$--fixed point by means of an
interpolation expansion in fixed dimension. The expansion is formulated for an
infinitesimal momentum space renormalization group. We choose a coordinate
representation for the fixed point interaction in derivative expansion, and
compute its coordinates to high orders by means of computer algebra. We compute
the series for the critical exponent $\nu$ up to order twenty five of
interpolation expansion in this representation, and evaluate it using \pade,
Borel--\pade, Borel--conformal--\pade, and Dlog--\pade resummation. The
resummation returns $0.6262(13)$ as the value of $\nu$.
