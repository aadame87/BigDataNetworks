  The scalars in vector multiplets of N=2 supersymmetric theories in 4
dimensions exhibit `special Kaehler geometry', related to duality symmetries,
due to their coupling to the vectors. In the literature there is some confusion
on the definition of special geometry, which we want to clear up, for rigid as
well as for local N=2.
