  A zero-brane is used to probe non-threshold BPS bound states of (p,
p+2,p+4)-branes. At long distances the stringy calculation agrees with the
supergravity calculations. The supergravity description is given, using the
interpretation of the D=8 dyonic membrane as the bound state of a two-brane
inside a four-brane. We investigate the short distance structure of these bound
states, compute the phase shift of the scattered zero-brane and find the bound
states characteristic size. It is found that there should be a supersymmetric
solution of type IIa supergravity, describing a bound state of a zero-brane and
two orthogonal two-brane, all inside a four-brane , with an additional unbound
zero-brane. We comment on the relationship between p-branes and
(p-2)-branes.
