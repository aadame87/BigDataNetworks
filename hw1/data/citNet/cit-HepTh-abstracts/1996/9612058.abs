Title: Whirling Waves and the Aharonov-Bohm Effect for Relativistic Spinning
  Particles

\\
  The formulation of Berry for the Aharonov-Bohm effect is generalized to the
relativistic regime. Then, the problem of finding the self-adjoint extensions
of the (2+1)-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian, in an Aharonov-Bohm background
potential, is solved in a novel way. The same treatment also solves the problem
of finding the self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac Hamiltonian in a background
Aharonov-Casher.
