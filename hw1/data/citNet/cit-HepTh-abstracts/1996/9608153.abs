  An interpolation between the canonical partition functions of Bose, Fermi and
Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is proposed. This interpolation makes use of the
properties of Jack polynomials and leads to a physically appealing
interpolation between the statistical weights of the three statistics. This, in
turn, can be used to define a new exclusion statistics in the spirit of the
work of Haldane.
