  We calculate the potential between two different stationary D-branes and the
velocity dependent potential between two different moving D-branes. We identify
configurations with some unbroken supersymmetry, using a zero force condition.
The potentials are compared with an eleven dimensional calculation of the
scattering of a zero black-brane from the $0,2,4$ and 6 black-brane of type
IIA supergravity. The agreement of these calculations provide further evidence
for the D-brane description of black-branes, and for the eleven dimensional
origin of type IIA string theory.
