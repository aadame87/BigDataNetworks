  Matrices are said to behave as free non-commuting random variables if the
action which governs their dynamics constrains only their eigenvalues, i.e.
depends on traces of powers of individual matrices. The authors use recently
developed mathematical techniques in combination with a standard variational
principle to formulate a new variational approach for matrix models.
Approximate variational solutions of interacting large-N matrix models are
found using the free random matrices as the variational space. Several classes
of classical and quantum mechanical matrix models with different types of
interactions are considered and the variational solutions compared with exact
Monte Carlo and analytical results. Impressive agreement is found in a majority
of cases.
