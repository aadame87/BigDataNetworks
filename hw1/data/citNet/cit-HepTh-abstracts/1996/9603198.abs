  The interest in string Hamiltonian system has recently been rekindled due to
its application to target-space duality. In this article, we explore another
direction it motivates. In Sec.\ 1, conformal symmetry and some algebraic
structures of the system that are related to interacting strings are discussed.
These lead one naturally to the study of Lorentz surfaces in Sec.\ 2. In
contrast to the case of Riemann surfaces, we show in Sec.\ 3 that there are
Lorentz surfaces that cannot be conformally deformed into Mandelstam diagrams.
Lastly in Sec.\ 4, we discuss speculatively the prospect of Lorentzian
conformal field theory.
  Additionally, to have a view of what quantum picture a string Hamiltonian
system may lead to, we discuss independently in the Appendix a formal geometric
quantization of the string phase space.
