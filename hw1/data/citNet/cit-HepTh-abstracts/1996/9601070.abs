  The generalized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations of irrational conformal
field theory provide a uniform description of rational and irrational conformal
field theory. Starting from the known high-level solution of these equations,
we first construct the high-level conformal blocks and correlators of all the
affine-Sugawara and coset constructions on simple g. Using intuition gained
from these cases, we then identify a simple class of irrational processes whose
high-level blocks and correlators we are also able to construct.
