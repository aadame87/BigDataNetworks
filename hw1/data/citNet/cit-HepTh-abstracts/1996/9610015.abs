  Using a contraction procedure, we obtain Toda theories and their structures,
from affine Toda theories and their corresponding structures. By structures, we
mean the equation of motion, the classical Lax pair, the boundary term for half
line theories, and the quantum transfer matrix. The Lax pair and the transfer
matrix so obtained, depend nontrivially on the spectral parameter.
