  This is the written version of a talk given at the Santa Barbara Workshop on
Supersymmetry in December of 1995. It summarizes a collection of results on
superstring cosmology obtained by the author and various collaborators, and
contains some speculations about the resolution of the cosmological constant
and vacuum selection problems in string theory.
