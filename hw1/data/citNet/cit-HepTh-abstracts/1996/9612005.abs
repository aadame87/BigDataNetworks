  Under certain conditions, imposed on the viscosity of the fluid, initial data
and the class of contours under consideration, the Cauchy problem with finite
values of time for the loop equation in turbulence with Gaussian random forces
is solved by making use of the smearing procedure for the loop space functional
Laplacian. The solution obtained depends on the initial data and its functional
derivatives and on the potential of the random forces.
