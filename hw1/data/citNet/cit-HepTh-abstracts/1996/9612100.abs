  A generalization of the classical one-dimensional Darboux transformation to
arbitrary n-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifolds is constructed using an
intrinsic formulation based on the properties of twisted Hodge Laplacians. The
classical two-dimensional Moutard transformation is also generalized to
non-compact oriented Riemannian manifolds of dimension n greater than one. New
examples of quasi-exactly solvable multidimensional matrix Schr\"odinger
operators on curved manifolds are obtained by applying the above results.
