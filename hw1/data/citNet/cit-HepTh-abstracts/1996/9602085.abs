  We continue studies on quantum field theories on noncommutative geometric
spaces, focusing on classes of noncommutative geometries which imply
ultraviolet and infrared modifications in the form of nonzero minimal
uncertainties in positions and momenta. The case of the ultraviolet modified
uncertainty relation which has appeared from string theory and quantum gravity
is covered. The example of euclidean $\phi^4$-theory is studied in detail and
in this example we can now show ultraviolet and infrared regularisation of all
graphs.
