  We show that a Hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie superalgebras having
bosonic simple roots (such as $OSp(1|4)$) ``does'' produce supersymmetric
Toda models, with superconformal symmetry being nonlinearly realised for those
fields of the Toda system which are related to the bosonic simple roots of the
superalgebra. A fermionic $b-c$ system of conformal spin $(3/2,-1/2)$ is a
natural ingredient of such models.
