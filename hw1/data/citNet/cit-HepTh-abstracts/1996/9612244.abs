  We examine the detail of the analytic structure of an exact analytic solution
of three anyons, which interpolates to the fermion ground state in a harmonic
potential well. The analysis is done on the fundamental domain with appropriate
boundary conditions. Some remarks on the hard-core conditions and
self-adjointness are made.
