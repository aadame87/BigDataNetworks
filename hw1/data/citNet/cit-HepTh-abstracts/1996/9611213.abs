  Supersymmetry breaking and compactification of extra space-time dimensions
may have a common dynamical origin if our universe is spontaneously generated
in the form of a four-dimensional topological or non-topological defect in
higher dimensional space-time. Within such an approach the conventional
particles are zero modes trapped in the core of the defect. In many cases
solutions of this type spontaneously break all supersymmetries of the original
theory, so that the low-energy observer from ``our'' universe inside the core
would not detect supersymmetry. Since the extra dimensions are not compact but,
rather, inaccessible to low-energy observers, the usual infinite tower of the
Kaluza-Klein excitations does not exist. Production of superpartners at the
energy scale of SUSY restoration will be accompanied by four-momentum
non-conservation. (Depending on the nature of the solution at hand, the
non-conservation may either happen above some threshold energy or be
continuous). In either case, the door to extra dimensions may be not very far
from the energies accessible at present colliders.
