  We discuss the connection between different entropies introduced for black
hole. It is demonstrated on the two-dimensional example that the (quantum)
thermodynamical entropy of a hole coincides (including UV-finite terms) with
its statistical-mechanical entropy calculated according to 't Hooft and
regularized by Pauli-Villars.
