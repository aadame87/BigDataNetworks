  The heat kernels of Laplacians for spin 1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2 fields, and the
asymptotic expansion of their traces are studied on manifolds with conical
singularities. The exact mode-by-mode analysis is carried out for 2-dimensional
domains and then extended to arbitrary dimensions. The corrections to the first
Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients in the trace expansion, due to conical
singularities, are found for all the above spins. The results for spins 1/2 and
1 resemble the scalar case. However, the heat kernels of the Lichnerowicz spin
2 operator and the spin 3/2 Laplacian show a new feature. When the conical
angle deficit vanishes the limiting values of these traces differ from the
corresponding values computed on the smooth manifold. The reason for the
discrepancy is breaking of the local translational isometries near a conical
singularity. As an application, the results are used to find the ultraviolet
divergences in the quantum corrections to the black hole entropy for all these
spins.
