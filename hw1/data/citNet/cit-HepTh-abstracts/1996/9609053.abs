  This note discusses some results on the non-BPS excitations of D-branes. We
show that the excitation spectrum of a bound state of D-strings changes
character when the length of the wrapping circle becomes less than $\sim
g^{-1}\LS$. We review the observed relation between the low energy absorption
cross-section of D-branes and the low energy absorption cross-section for black
holes. We discuss various issues related to the information question for black
holes.
