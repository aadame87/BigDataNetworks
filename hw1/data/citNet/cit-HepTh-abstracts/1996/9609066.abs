  We derive a simple formula for the periods associated with the low energy
effective action of $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory with
massive $N_f\le 3$ hypermultiplets.  This is given by evaluating explicitly
the integral associated to the elliptic curve using various identities of
hypergeometric functions. Following this formalism, we can calculate the
prepotential with massive hypermultiplets both in the weak coupling region
and in the strong coupling region. In particular, we show how the Higgs field
and its dual field are expressed as generalized hypergeometric functions when
the theory has a conformal point.
