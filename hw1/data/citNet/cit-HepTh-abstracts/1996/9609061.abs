  We compute vacuum expectation values of products of fermion bilinears for
two-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics at finite flavored fermion densities. We
introduce the chemical potential as an external charge distribution within the
path-integral approach and carefully analyse the contribution of different
topological sectors to fermion correlators. We show the existence of chiral
condensates exhibiting an oscillatory inhomogeneous behavior as a function of a
chemical potential matrix. This result is exact and goes in the same direction
as the behavior found in QCD_4 within the large N approximation.
