  We study critical and universal behaviors of unitary invariant non-gaussian
random matrix ensembles within the framework of the large-N renormalization
group. For a simple double-well model we find an unstable fixed point and a
stable inverse-gaussian fixed point. The former is identified as the critical
point of single/double-arc phase transition with a discontinuity of the third
derivative of the free energy. The latter signifies a novel universality of
large-N correlators other than the usual single arc type. This phase structure
is consistent with the universality classification of two-level correlators for
multiple-arc models by Ambjorn and Akemann. We also establish the stability of
the gaussian fixed point in the multi-coupling model.
