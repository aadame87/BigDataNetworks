  It is shown that the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger theory on the cylinder
can be consistently quantized (using Dirac's approach) without imposing any
constraints on the sign of the gravitational coupling constant or the sign (or
value) of the cosmological constant. The quantum constraints in terms of the
original geometrical variables are also derived.
