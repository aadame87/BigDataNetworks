  The coulomb branch of $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theories in
$d=2+1$ is studied. A direct connection between gauge theories and monopole
moduli spaces is presented. It is proposed that the hyper-K\"ahler metric of
supersymmetric $N=4$ $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is given by the charge $N$
centered moduli space of BPS monopoles in $SU(2)$. The theory is compared to
$N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions through
compactification on a circle of the latter. It is found that rational maps are
appropriate to this comparison. A BPS mass formula is also written for
particles in three dimensions and strings in four dimensions.
