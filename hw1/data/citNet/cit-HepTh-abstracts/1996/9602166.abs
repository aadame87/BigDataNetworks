Title: Interpretation of the Determinant Formulae for the Chiral
  Representations of the N=2 Superconformal Algebra
Authors: Beatriz Gato-Rivera and Jose Ignacio Rosado
Comments: This is a major revision. Our results are complementary, not
  contradictory, to the standard interpretation of the N=2 determinant
  formulae, because the latter do not apply directly to chiral modules. We have
  also added one chapter analyzing the Periodic algebra
Report-no: IMAFF-96/38, NIKHEF-96-007

  We show that the N=2 determinant formulae of the Aperiodic NS algebra and the
Periodic R algebra can be applied directly to incomplete Verma modules built on
chiral primary states and on Ramond ground states, respectively, provided one
modifies the interpretation of the zeroes in an appropriate way. That is, the
zeroes of the determinat formulae account for the highest weight singular
states built on chiral primaries and on Ramond ground states, but the
identification of the levels and relative U(1) charges of the singular states
is different than for complete Verma modules. In particular, half of the zeroes
of the quadratic vanishing surfaces $f^A_{r,s}=0$ and $f^P_{r,s}=0$ correspond
to uncharged singular states, and the other half correspond to charged singular
states. We derive the spectrum of singular states built on chiral primaries,
including the singular states of the Twisted Topological algebra, and the
spectrum of singular states built on the Ramond ground states. We also uncover
the existence of non-highest weight singular states which are not secondary of
any highest weight singular state.
