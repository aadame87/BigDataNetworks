  The structure of state vector space for a general (non-anomalous) gauge
theory is studied within the Lagrangian version of the $Sp(2)$-symmetric
quantization method. The physical {\it S}-matrix unitarity conditions are
formulated. The general results are illustrated on the basis of simple gauge
theory models.
