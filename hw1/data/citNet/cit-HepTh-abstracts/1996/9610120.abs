  We analyze terms subleading to Rutherford in the $S$-matrix between black
hole and probes of successively high energies. We show that by an appropriate
choice of the probe one can read off the quantum state of the black hole from
the S-matrix, staying asymptotically far from the BH all the time. We interpret
the scattering experiment as scattering off classical stringy backgrounds which
explicitly depend on the internal quantum numbers of the black hole.
