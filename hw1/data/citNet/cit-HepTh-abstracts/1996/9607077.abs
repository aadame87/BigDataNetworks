  In N=2 ungauged supergravity we have found the most general double-extreme
dyonic black holes with arbitrary number n_v of constant vector multiplets and
n_h of constant hypermultiplets. They are double-extreme: 1) supersymmetric
with coinciding horizons, 2) the mass for a given set of quantized charges is
extremal. The spacetime is of the Reissner-Nordstrom form and the vector
multiplet moduli depend on dyon charges. As an example we display n_v complex
moduli as functions of 2(n_v+1) electric and magnetic charges in a model
related to a classical Calabi-Yau moduli space. A specific case includes the
complex S, T, U moduli depending on 4 electric and 4 magnetic charges of 4 U(1)
gauge groups.
