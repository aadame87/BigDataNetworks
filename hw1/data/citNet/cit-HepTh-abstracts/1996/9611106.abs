  It is shown how monopoles and dyons decay on curves of marginal stability in
the moduli space of vacua at weak coupling in pure N=2 gauge theory with
arbitrary gauge group. The analysis involves a semi-classical treatment of the
monopole and rests on the fact that the monopole moduli space spaces for a
magnetic charge vector equal to a non-simple root enlarge discontinuously at
the curves of marginal stability. This enlargement of the moduli space
describes the freedom for the monopole to be separated into stable constituent
monopoles. Such decays do not occur in the associated theory with N=4
supersymmetry because in this case there exist bound-states at threshold.
