  A path integral evaluation of the Green's function for the hydrogen atom
initiated by Duru and Kleinert is studied by recognizing it as a special case
of the general treatment of the separable Hamiltonian of Liouville-type. The
basic dynamical principle involved is identified as the Jacobi's principle of
least action for given energy which is reparametrization invariant, and thus
the appearance of a gauge freedom is naturally understood. The separation of
variables in operator formalism corresponds to a choice of gauge in path
integral, and the Green's function is shown to be gauge independent if the
operator ordering is properly taken into account. Unlike the conventional
Feynman path integral,which deals with a space-time picture of particle motion,
the path integral on the basis of the Jacobi's principle sums over orbits in
space. We illustrate these properties by evaluating an exact path integral of
the Green's function for the hydrogen atom in parabolic coordinates, and thus
avoiding the use of the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. In the present
formulation , the Hamiltonian for Stark effect is converted to the one for
anharmonic oscillators with an unstable quartic coupling. We also study the
hydrogen atom path integral from a view point of one-dimensional quantum
gravity coupled to matter fields representing the electron coordinates. A
simple BRST analysis of the problem with an evaluation of Weyl anomaly is
presented .
