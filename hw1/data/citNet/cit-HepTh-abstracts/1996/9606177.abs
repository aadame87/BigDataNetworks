  Critical phenomena in the two-dimensional Ising model with a defect line are
studied using boundary conformal field theory on the $c=1$ orbifold. Novel
features of the boundary states arising from the orbifold structure, including
continuously varying boundary critical exponents, are elucidated. New features
of the Ising defect problem are obtained including a novel universality class
of defect lines and the universal boundary to bulk crossover of the spin
correlation function.
