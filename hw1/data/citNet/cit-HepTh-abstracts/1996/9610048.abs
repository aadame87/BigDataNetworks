  Within the framework of generalized functions a general consistent definition
of double commutators is given. This definition respects the Jacobi identity
even if the regularization is removed. The double commutator of fermionic
currents is calculated in this limit. We show that BJL--type prescriptions and
point--splitting prescriptions for calculating double commutators fail to give
correct results in free field theory.
