  We derive, in 2+1 dimensions, classical solutions for metric and motion of
two or more spinning particles, in the conformal Coulomb gauge introduced
previously. The solutions are exact in the $N$-body static case, and are
perturbative in the particles' velocities in the dynamic two-body case. A
natural boundary for the existence of our gauge choice is provided by some
``CTC horizons'' encircling the particles, within which closed timelike curves
occur.
