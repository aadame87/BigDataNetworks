  We provide N=1 Super Yang-Mills theory in the Wess-Zumino gauge with mass
terms for the supersymmetric partners of the gauge fields and of the matter
fields, together with a supersymmetric mass term for the fermionic matter
fields. All mass terms are chosen in such a way to induce soft supersymmetry
breakings at most, while preserving gauge invariance to all orders of
perturbation theory. The breakings are controlled through an extended
Slavnov-Taylor identity. The renormalization analysis, both in the ultraviolet
and in the infrared region, is performed.
