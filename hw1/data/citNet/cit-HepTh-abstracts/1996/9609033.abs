  In order to obtain a consistent formulation of octonionic quantum mechanics
(OQM), we introduce left-right barred operators. Such operators enable us to
find the translation rules between octonionic numbers and $8\times 8$ real
matrices (a translation is also given for $4\times 4$ complex matrices). We
develop an octonionic relativistic free wave equation, linear in the
derivatives. Even if the wave functions are only one-component we show that
four independent solutions, corresponding to those of the Dirac equation,
exist.
