  In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of eleven-dimensional
supergravity on a manifold with boundary, which is believed to be relevant to
the strong coupling limit of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string. Gauge and
gravitational anomalies enter at a very early stage, and require a refinement
of the standard Green-Schwarz mechanism for their cancellation. This uniquely
determines the gauge group to be a copy of $E_8$ for each boundary component,
fixes the gauge coupling constant in terms of the gravitational constant, and
leads to several striking new tests of the hypothesis that there is a
consistent quantum $M$-theory with eleven-dimensional supergravity as its low
energy limit.
