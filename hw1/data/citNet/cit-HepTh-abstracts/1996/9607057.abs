  We study orbifold compactifications of F-theory which lead to $N=1$
supersymmetry in 6 and 4 spacetime dimensions. These are dual to specific
orientifolds of M-theory, and in many cases to orientifolds of type IIB string
theory. The equivalences are demonstrated by mapping the orbifolding
transformations in the F, M and string theories to each other using dualities.
We observe that M and F-theory appear to possess a property similar to discrete
torsion in string theory. This is related to an ambiguity recently noted by
Polchinski in the orientifold projection for 6-dimensional models. The
4-dimensional compactifications exhibit similar features, from which we predict
the existence of certain new orientifolds of type IIB. Some orbifolds with
higher supersymmetry are also examined.
