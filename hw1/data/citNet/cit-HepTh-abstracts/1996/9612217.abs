  A new action of the Yangians in the WZW models is displayed. Its structure is
generic and level independent. This Yangian is the natural extension at the
conformal point of the one unravelled in massive theories with current
algebras. Expectingly, this new symmetry of WZW models will lead to a deeper
understanding of the integrable structure of conformal field theories and their
deformations.
