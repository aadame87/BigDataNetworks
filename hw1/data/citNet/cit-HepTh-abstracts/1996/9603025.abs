Title: How to renormalize a quantum gauge field theory with chiral fermions
Author: Hung Cheng and S.P. Li

  We propose using the method of subtraction to renormalize quantum gauge
theories with chiral fermions and with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The
Ward-Takahashi identities derived from the BRST invariance in these theories
are complex and rich in content. We demonstrate how to use these identities to
determine relationships among renormalization constants of the theory and
obtain the subtraction constants needed for the renormalization procedure. We
have found it particularly convenient to adopt the Landau gauge throughout the
scheme. The method of renormalization by subtraction enables one to calculate
physical quantities in the theory in the form of a renormalized perturbation
series which is unique and definite. There is no ambiguity in handling the
$\gamma_5$ matrix associated with chiral fermions.
