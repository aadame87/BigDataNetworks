  We consider a particular 4-dimensional generalization of the transition from
the Heisenberg to the Schr\"odinger picture. The space-time independent
expansion with respect to the unitary irreducible representations of the
Lorentz group is applied, as Fourier transformation in the Heisenberg picture,
to the states of a massive relativistic particle. A new Hamiltonian operator
has been found for such a particle with spin one.
