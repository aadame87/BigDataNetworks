  The conditions leading to a nontrivial renormalization of the topological
charge in four--dimensional Yang--Mills theory are discussed. It is shown that
if the topological term is regarded as the limit of a certain nontopological
interaction, quantum effects due to the gauge bosons lead to a finite
multiplicative renormalization of the theta--parameter while fermions give rise
to an additional shift of theta. A truncated form of an exact renormalization
group equation is used to study the scale dependence of the theta--parameter.
Possible implications for the strong CP--problem of QCD are discussed.
