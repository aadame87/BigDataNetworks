  A class of quantum field theories invariant with respect to the action of
an odd vector field Q on a source supermanifold $\Sigma$ is considered. We
suppose that Q satisfies the conditions under which an integral of any
Q-invariant function over $\Sigma$ localizes to the zero locus of Q. The
Q-invariant sector of a field theory from the class above is shown then to be
equivalent to the quantum field theory defined on zero locus of the vector
field Q.
