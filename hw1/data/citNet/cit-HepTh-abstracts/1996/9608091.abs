  We derive a generalization of the Destri - De Vega equation governing the
scaling functions of some excited states in the Sine-Gordon theory. In
particular configurations with an even number of holes and no strings are
analyzed and their UV limits found to match some of the conformal dimensions of
the corresponding compactified massless free boson. Quantum group reduction
allows to interpret some of our results as scaling functions of excited states
of Restricted Sine-Gordon theory, i.e. minimal models perturbed by phi_13 in
their massive regime. In particular we are able to reconstruct the scaling
functions of the off-critical deformations of all the scalar primary states on
the diagonal of the Kac-table.
