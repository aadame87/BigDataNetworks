  A generic Lagrangian, in arbitrary spacetime dimension, describing the
interaction of a graviton, a dilaton and two antisymmetric tensors is
considered. An isotropic p-brane solution consisting of three blocks and
depending on four parameters in the Lagrangian and two arbitrary harmonic
functions is obtained. For specific values of parameters in the Lagrangian the
solution may be identified with previously known superstring solutions.
