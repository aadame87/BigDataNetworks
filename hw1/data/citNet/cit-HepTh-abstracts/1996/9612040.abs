  We study $su(2)_k$ WZW model perturbed by a multiplet of primary fields. The
theory has a rich variety of particles. Presence of nontrivial decay processes
is a peculiarity of the model. We prove integrability by explicit construction
of quantum conserved currents. The scattering theory is briefly discussed.
