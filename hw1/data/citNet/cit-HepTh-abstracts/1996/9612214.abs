  We formulate a renormalized running coupling expansion for the
$\beta$--function and the potential of the renormalized $\phi^4$--trajectory on
four dimensional Euclidean space-time. Renormalization invariance is used as a
first principle. No reference is made to bare quantities. The expansion is
proved to be finite to all orders of perturbation theory. The proof includes a
large momentum bound on the connected free propagator amputated vertices.
