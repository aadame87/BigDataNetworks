  The large N limit of a one-dimensional infinite chain of random matrices is
investigated. It is found that in addition to the expected Kosterlitz--Thouless
phase transition this model exhibits an infinite series of phase transitions at
special values of the lattice spacing \epsilon_{pq}=\sin(\pi p/2q). An unusual
property of these transitions is that they are totally invisible in the double
scaling limit. A method which allows us to explore the transition regions
analytically and to determine certain critical exponents is developed. It is
argued that phase transitions of this kind can be induced by the interaction of
two-dimensional vortices with curvature defects of a fluctuating random
lattice.
