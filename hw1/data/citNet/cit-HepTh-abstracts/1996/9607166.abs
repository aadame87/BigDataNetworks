  We discuss the statistical-mechanical entropy of black hole calculated
according to 't Hooft. It is argued that in presence of horizon the statistical
mechanics of quantum fields depends on their UV behavior. The ``brick wall''
model was shown to provide a correct description when the ``brick wall''
parameter is less than any UV cut-off.
