Title: On the Eleventh Dimension of String Theory
Author: Noureddine Mohammedi (Tours University)
Comments: 8 pages, Latex
\\
  An explanation of the origin of the hidden eleventh dimension in string
theory is given. It is shown that any two sigma models describing the
propagation of string backgrounds are related to each other by a Weyl
transformation of the world-sheet metric. To avoid this ambiguity in defining
two-dimensional sigma models, extra fields are needed. An interesting
connection is established with Abelian T-duality.
