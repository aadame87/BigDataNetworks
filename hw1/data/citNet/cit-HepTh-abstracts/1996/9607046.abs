  It is shown that the scaling operators in the conformal limit of a
two-dimensional field theory have massive form factors which obey a simple
factorisation property in rapidity space. This has been used to identify such
operators within the form factor bootstrap approach. A sum rule which yields
the scaling dimension of such operators is also derived.
