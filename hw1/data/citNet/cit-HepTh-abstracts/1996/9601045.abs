  We explore quantum electrodynamics in (1+1) dimensions at finite temperature
using the method of Discretized Light-Cone Quantisation. The partition
function, energy and specific heat are computed in the canonical ensemble using
the spectrum of invariant masses computed with a standard DLCQ numerical
routine. In particular, the specific heat exhibits a peak which grows as the
continuum limit is numerically approached. A critical exponent is tentatively
extracted. The surprising result is that the density of states contains
significant finite size artifacts even for a relatively high harmonic
resolution. These and the other outstanding problems in the present calculation
are discussed.
