  In the present paper we investigate classical dynamics of the Nambu-Goto
string with the Gauss-Bonnet term in the action and point-like masses at the
ends in the context of effective QCD string. The configurations of rigidly
rotating string is studied and its application to phenomenological description
of meson is discussed.
