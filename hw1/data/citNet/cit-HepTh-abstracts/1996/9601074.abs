  We find black hole solutions to Euclidean 2+1 gravity coupled to a
relativistic particle which have a dynamical conical singularity at the
horizon. These solutions mimic the tree level contribution to the partition
function of gravity coupled to a quantum field theory. They are found to
violate the standard area law for black hole entropy, their entropy being
proportional to the total opening angle. Since each solution depends on the
number of windings of the particle path around the horizon, the significance of
their summation in the path integral is considered.
