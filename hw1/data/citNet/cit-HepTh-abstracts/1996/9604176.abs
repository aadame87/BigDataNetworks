  We give general expressions for singular vectors of the N=2 superconformal
algebra in the form of {\it monomials} in the continued operators by which the
universal enveloping algebra of N=2 is extended. We then show how the algebraic
relations satisfied by the continued operators can be used to transform the
monomials into the standard Verma-module expressions. Our construction is based
on continuing the extremal diagrams of N=2 Verma modules to the states
satisfying the twisted \hw{} conditions with complex twists. It allows us to
establish recursion relations between singular vectors of different series and
at different levels. Thus, the N=2 singular vectors can be generated from a
smaller set of the so-called topological singular vectors, which are
distinguished by being in a 1:1 correspondence with singular vectors in affine
sl(2) Verma modules. The method of `continued products' of fermions is a
counterpart of the method of complex powers used in the constructions of
singular vectors for affine Lie algebras.
