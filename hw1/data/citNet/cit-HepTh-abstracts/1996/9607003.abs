  In spite of its simplicity and beauty, the Mathai-Quillen formulation of
cohomological topological quantum field theory with gauge symmetry suffers two
basic problems: $i$) the existence of reducible field configurations on which
the action of the gauge group is not free and $ii$) the Gribov ambiguity
associated with gauge fixing, i. e. the lack of global definition on the space
of gauge orbits of gauge fixed functional integrals. In this paper, we show
that such problems are in fact related and we propose a general completely
geometrical recipe for their treatment. The space of field configurations is
augmented in such a way to render the action of the gauge group free and
localization is suitably modified. In this way, the standard Mathai--Quillen
formalism can be rigorously applied. The resulting topological action contains
the ordinary action as a subsector and can be shown to yield a local quantum
field theory, which is argued to be renormalizable as well. The salient feature
of our method is that the Gribov problem is inherent in localization, and thus
can be dealt with in a completely equivariant setting, whereas gauge fixing is
free of Gribov ambiguities. For the stratum of irreducible gauge orbits, the
case of main interest in applications, the Gribov problem is solvable.
Conversely, for the the strata of reducible gauge orbits, the Gribov problem
cannot be solved in general and the obstruction may be described in the
language of sheaf theory. The formalism is applied to the Donaldson--Witten
model.
