  The purpose of this Letter is to present a computation of the interaction
energy of gauged O(3) Chern-Simons vortices which are infinitely separated. The
results will show the behaviour of the interaction energy as a function of the
constant coupling the potential, which measures the relative strength of the
matter self-coupling and the electromagnetic coupling. We find that vortices
attract each other for $\lambda > 1 $ and repel when $\lambda < 1 $. When
$\lambda =1 $ there is a topological lower bound on the energy. It is possible
to saturate the bound if the fields satisfy a set of first order partial
differential equations.
