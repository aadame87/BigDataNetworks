  A quantal guiding center theory allowing to systematically study the
separation of the different time scale behaviours of a quantum charged spinning
particle moving in an external inhomogeneous magnetic filed is presented. A
suitable set of operators adapting to the canonical structure of the problem
and generalizing the kinematical momenta and guiding center operators of a
particle coupled to a homogenous magnetic filed is constructed. The Pauli
Hamiltonian rewrites in this way as a power series in the magnetic length $l_B=
\sqrt{\hbar c/eB}$ making the problem amenable to a perturbative analysis. The
first two terms of the series are explicitly constructed. The effective
adiabatic dynamics turns to be in coupling with a gauge filed and a scalar
potential. The mechanism producing such magnetic-induced geometric-magnetism is
investigated in some detail.
