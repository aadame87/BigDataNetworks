  We present a brief review of some recent results on conformal anomalies in
four and more dimensions. The discussion is intended for relativists, so some
background on the quantum origin of anomalies and of their simple properties in
D=2 is also provided. Topics treated include a critical review of the effective
gravitational action uniqueness problem and the derivation of beta functions,
independent of ultraviolet behavior, from the type B anomaly.
