  An orientifold of Type-IIB theory on a $K3$ realized as a $Z_2$ orbifold is
constructed which corresponds to F-theory compactification on a Calabi-Yau
orbifold with Hodge numbers $(51, 3)$. The T-dual of this model is analogous to
an orbifold with discrete torsion in that the action of orientation reversal
has an additional phase on the twisted sectors, and both 9-branes and 5-branes
carry orthogonal gauge groups. An orientifold of the $Z_3$ orbifold and its
relation to F-theory is briefly discussed.
