Title: Split Dimensional Regularization for the Coulomb Gauge

Comments: 19 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 72 references. This Replaced version
  clarifies why the Coulomb gauge requires a new type of regularization, and
  why our new regularization is compatible with Wick rotation. Results and

  A new procedure for regularizing Feynman integrals in the noncovariant
Coulomb gauge is proposed for Yang-Mills theory. The procedure is based on a
variant of dimensional regularization, called split dimensional regularization,
which leads to internally consistent, ambiguity-free integrals. It is
demonstrated that split dimensional regularization yields a one-loop Yang-Mills
self-energy that is nontransverse, but local. Despite the noncovariant nature
of the Coulomb gauge, ghosts are necessary in order to satisfy the appropriate
Ward/BRS identity. The computed Coulomb-gauge Feynman integrals are applicable
to both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge models.
