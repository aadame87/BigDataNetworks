  In this thesis steps are taken in the direction of formulating non-critical
strings in the framework of the $G/G$ approach. A major part of the thesis is
concerned with conformal field theory based on affine $SL(2)$ current algebra,
in particular for admissible representations which are relevant in the
$SL(2)/SL(2)$ description of coupling conformal minimal matter to 2D gravity.
By virtue of fractional calculus, free field realizations are made applicable
of producing integral representations of chiral blocks, even in the case of
admissible representations where ghost fields raised to fractional powers are
inherent. The famous work on minimal models by Dotsenko and Fateev is then
generalised, working out monodromy invariant 4-point Greens functions and the
operator algebra coefficients. Furthermore, the fusion rules are re-derived
within the context of free field realizations by introducing the notion of
over-screening. For higher groups an explicit Wakimoto free field realization
is presented of affine current algebras based on simple Lie groups.
Furthermore, a study is undertaken of primary fields in the framework of extra
$x$ variables, and screening currents of both kinds are discussed. Several new
and definite results are presented. A quantum group structure relying on both
kinds of screening currents is discussed along the lines of Gomez and Sierra.
