  By relating the two-dimensional U(N) Principal Chiral Model to a simple
linear system we obtain a free-field parametrisation of solutions. Obvious
symmetry transformations on the free-field data give symmetries of the model.
In this way all known `hidden symmetries' and B\"acklund transformations, as
well as a host of new symmetries, arise.
