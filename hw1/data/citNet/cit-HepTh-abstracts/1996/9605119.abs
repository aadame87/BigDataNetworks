  We investigate three classes of supersymmetric models which can be obtained
by breaking the chiral SU(2k+3) gauge theories with one antisymmetric tensor
and 2k-1 antifundamentals. For N=3, the chiral SU(2k)$\times$SU(3)$\times$U(1)
theories break supersym metry by the quantum deformations of the moduli spaces
in the strong SU(2k) gauge coupling limit. For N=2, it is the generalization of
the SU(5)$\times$U(2)$\times$U(1) model mentioned in the literature.
Supersymmetry is broken by carefully choosing the q uark-antiquark-doublet
Yukawa couplings in this model. For N=1, this becomes the well-known model
discussed in the literature.
