  Phase transitions are studied in $M$-theory and $F$-theory. In $M$-theory
compactification to five dimensions on a Calabi-Yau, there are
topology-changing transitions similar to those seen in conformal field theory,
but the non-geometrical phases known in conformal field theory are absent. At
boundaries of moduli space where such phases might have been expected, the
moduli space ends, by a conventional or unconventional physical mechanism. The
unconventional mechanisms, which roughly involve the appearance of tensionless
strings, can sometimes be better understood in $F$-theory.
