  The superconformal invariants in analytic superspace are found.
Superconformal invariance is shown to imply that the Green's functions of
analytic operators are invariant holomorphic sections of a line bundle on a
product of certain harmonic superspaces. It is argued that the correlation
functions for a class of sufficiently low dimension gauge invariant operators
in N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be evaluated up to
constants.
