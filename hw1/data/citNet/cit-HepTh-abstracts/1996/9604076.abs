  The general structure of the renormalization group equations for the low
energy effective field theory formulation of pure gravity is presented. The
solution of these equations takes a particular simple form if the mass scale of
the effective theory is much smaller than the Planck mass (a possibility
compatible with the renormalization of the effective theory). A theory with
just one free renormalized parameter is obtained when contributions suppressed
by inverse powers of the Planck mass are neglected.
