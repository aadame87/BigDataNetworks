  Matrix model approach to multicolor induced QCD based on the quenched
momentum prescription is presented. It is shown that this model exhibits the
reduction of spatial degrees of freedom: the partition function is determined
by the solution of one dimensional quantum mechanical problem while the
D-dimensional scalar field correlators coinside with the same type correlators
in the two-dimensional induced QCD.
