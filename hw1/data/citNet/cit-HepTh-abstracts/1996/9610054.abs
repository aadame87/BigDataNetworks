  We analyze the 1+1 dimensional Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model non-perturbatively.
We study non-trivial saddle points of the effective action in which the
composite fields $\sigx=<\bar\psi\psi>$ and $\pix=<\bar\psii\gam_5\psi>$ form
static space dependent configurations. These configurations may be viewed as
one dimensional chiral bags that trap the original fermions (``quarks'') into
stable extended entities (``hadrons''). We provide explicit expressions for
the profiles of some of these objects and calculate their masses. Our
analysis of these saddle points, and in particular, the proof that the
$\sigx, \pix$ condensations must give rise to a reflectionless Dirac
operator, appear to us simpler and more direct than the calculations
previously done by Shei, using the inverse scattering method following
Dashen, Hasslacher, and Neveu.
