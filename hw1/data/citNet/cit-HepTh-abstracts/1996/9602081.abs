Title: On the analogy between electromagnetism and turbulent hydrodynamics

  In this note, we propose an exegesis of the Maxwell equations for
electromagnetism. We begin with an analogy between the homogeneous Maxwell
equations and the equations needed to describe the vorticity field of an
incompressible inviscid fluid. We suggest that the inhomogeneous equations are
analogous to two equations valid in turbulent hydrodynamics. Once the analogy
is completed we give the mechanical analogue of the Poynting vector and we
explain the influence of a long solenoid on the motion of a charged particle.
