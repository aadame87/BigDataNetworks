  The classical Yang--Mills equations are analyzed within the geometrical
framework of an effective gravity theory. Exact analytical solutions are
derived for the cylindrically symmetric configurations of the coupled gauge and
isoscalar fields. It turns out that there is an infinite family of solutions
parametrized by two real parameters, one of which determines the asymptotic
behavior of fields near the symmetry axis and in infinity, while the second
locates the singularity. These configurations have a simple pole at a finite
value of the radial coordinate, and physically they represent ``thick
string''-like objects which possess the confinement properties. It is
demonstrated that the particles with gauge charge cannot move classically and
quantum mechanically out of the interior region. Such an objects are thus
direct analogues of the ``black string'' gravitational configurations reported
recently in the literature.
