  The statistics of meanders is studied in connection with the Temperley-Lieb
algebra. Each (multi-component) meander corresponds to a pair of reduced
elements of the algebra. The assignment of a weight $q$ per connected component
of meander translates into a bilinear form on the algebra, with a Gram matrix
encoding the fine structure of meander numbers. Here, we calculate the
associated Gram determinant as a function of $q$, and make use of the
orthogonalization process to derive alternative expressions for meander numbers
as sums over correlated random walks.
