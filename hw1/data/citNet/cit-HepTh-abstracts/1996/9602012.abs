Author: M.Reuter
Comments: 25 pages, latex
Report-no: DESY 96-016
\\
  The effective average actions for gauge theories and the associated
nonperturbative evolution equations which govern their renormalization group
flow are reviewed and various applications are described. As an example of a
topological field theory, Chern-Simons theory is discussed in detail.
