  We derive a path integral expression for the transition amplitude in
1+1-dimensional QCD starting from canonically quantized QCD. Gauge fixing after
quantization leads to a formulation in terms of gauge invariant but curvilinear
variables. Remainders of the curved space are Jacobians, an effective
potential, and sign factors just as for the problem of a particle in a box.
Based on this result we derive a Faddeev-Popov like expression for the
transition amplitude avoiding standard infinities that are caused by
integrations over gauge equivalent configurations.
