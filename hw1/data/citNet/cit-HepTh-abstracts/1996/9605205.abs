  A previously unnoticed connection between the Lax descriptions and the
superextensions of the KdV hierarchy is presented. It is shown that the two
different Lax descriptions of the KdV hierarchy come out naturally from two
different bihamiltonian superextensions of the KdV hierarchy. Some implications
of this observation are briefly mentioned.
