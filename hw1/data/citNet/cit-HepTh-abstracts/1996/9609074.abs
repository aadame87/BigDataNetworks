  We prove that three-dimensional $N=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons
theory is finite to all loop orders. In general this leaves open the
possibility that different regularization methods lead to different finite
effective actions. We show that in this model dimensional regularization and
regularization by dimensional reduction yield the same effective action.
Consequently, the superfield approach preserves BRS invariance for this model.
