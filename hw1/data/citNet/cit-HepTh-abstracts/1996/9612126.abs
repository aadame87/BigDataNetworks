  We discuss the origin of enhanced gauge symmetry in ALE (and K3)
compactification of M theory, either defined as the strong coupling limit of
the type IIa superstring, or as defined by Banks et al. In the D-brane
formalism, wrapped membranes are D0 branes with twisted string boundary
conditions, and appear on the same footing with the Kaluza-Klein excitations of
the gauge bosons. In M(atrix) theory, the construction appears to work for
arbitrary ALE metric.
