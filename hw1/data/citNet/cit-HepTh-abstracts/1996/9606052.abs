  We present the full calculation of the divergent one-loop contribution to the
effective boson Lagrangian for supergravity, including the Yang-Mills sector
and the helicity-odd operators that arise from integration over fermion fields.
The only restriction is on the Yang-Mills kinetic energy normalization
function, which is taken diagonal in gauge indices, as in models obtained from
superstrings.
