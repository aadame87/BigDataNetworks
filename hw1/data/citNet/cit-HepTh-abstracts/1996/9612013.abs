  We simplify, to a single integral of dilogarithms, the least tractable
O(1/N^3) contribution to the large-N critical exponent $\eta$ of the
non-linear sigma-model, and hence $\phi^4$-theory, for any spacetime
dimensionality, D. It is the sole generator of irreducible multiple zeta
values in epsilon-expansions with $D=2-2\epsilon$, for the sigma-model, and
$D=4-2\epsilon$, for $\phi^4$-theory. In both cases we confirm results of
Broadhurst, Gracey and Kreimer (BGK) that relate knots to counterterms. The
new compact form is much simpler than that of BGK. It enables us to develop 8
new terms in the epsilon-expansion with $D=3-2\epsilon$. These involve
alternating Euler sums, for which the basis of irreducibles is larger. We
conclude that massless Feynman diagrams in odd spacetime dimensions share the
greater transcendental complexity of massive diagrams in even dimensions,
such as those contributing to the electron's magnetic moment and the
electroweak $\rho$-parameter. Consequences for the perturbative sector of
Chern-Simons theory are discussed.
