  The production rate of a soft photon from a hot quark-gluon plasma is
computed to leading order at logarithmic accuracy. The canonical
hard-thermal-loop resummation scheme leads to logarithmically divergent
production rate due to mass singularities. We show that these mass
singularities are screened by employing the effective hard-quark propagator,
which is obtained through resummation of one-loop self-energy part in a
self-consistent manner. The damping-rate part of the effective hard-quark
propagator, rather than the thermal-mass part, plays the dominant role of
screening mass singularities. Diagrams including photon--(hard-)quark vertex
corrections also yield leading contribution to the production rate.
