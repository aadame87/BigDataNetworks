  We show that constraints on the generating functional have direct
BRST-extensions in terms of nilpotent operators $\Delta$ that annihilate this
generating functional, and which may be of arbitrarily high order. The free
energy $F$ in the presence of external sources thus satisfies a ``Master
Equation'' which is described in terms of a tower of higher antibrackets.
