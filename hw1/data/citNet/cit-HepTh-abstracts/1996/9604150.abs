  We propose a renormalization prescription for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of
(3+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity and also propose a strong coupling expansion
as an approximation scheme to probe quantum geometry at length scales much
smaller than the Planck length. We solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to the
second order in the expansion in a class of local solutions and discuss
problems arising in our approach.
