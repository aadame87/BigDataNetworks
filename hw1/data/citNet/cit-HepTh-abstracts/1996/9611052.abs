  We consider a configuration of strings and solitons in the type IIB
superstring theory on $M^5\times T^5$, which is composed of a set of
arbitrarily-wound D-fivebranes on $T^5$ and a set of arbitrarily-wound
D-strings on $S^1$ of the torus. For the configuration, it is shown that number
of microscopic states is bounded from above by the exponential of the
Hawking-Bekenstein entropy of the corresponding black hole and the temperature
of closed string radiation from the D-branes is bounded from below by the
Hawking temperature of the black hole. After discussing the necessary and
sufficient condition to saturate these bounds, we give some speculations about
black hole thermodynamics.
