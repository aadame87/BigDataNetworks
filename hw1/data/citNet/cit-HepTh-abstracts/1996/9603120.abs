  It is shown that the string equation can be obtain from field equations. Such
work is performed to scalar field. The equation obtained in nonrelativistic
limit describes the nonlinear string. Such string has the effective elasticity
connencted with the local string curvature. Some examples of the movement such
nonlinear elastic string are considered.
