  Recently the existence of certain SU(2) BPS monopoles with the symmetries of
the Platonic solids has been proved. Numerical results in an earlier paper
suggest that one of these new monopoles, the tetrahedral 3-monopole, has a
remarkable new property, in that the number of zeros of the Higgs field is
greater than the topological charge (number of monopoles). As a consequence,
zeros of the Higgs field exist (called anti-zeros) around which the local
winding number has opposite sign to that of the total winding. In this letter
we investigate the presence of anti-zeros for the other Platonic monopoles.
Other aspects of anti-zeros are also discussed.
