  The boundary effects in the screening of an applied magnetic field in a
charged anyon fluid at finite temperature and density are investigated. By
analytically solving the extremum equations of the sytem and minimizing the
free energy density, we find that in a sample with only one boundary (the half
plane), a total Meissner effect takes place; while the sample with two
boundaries (the infinite strip) exhibits a partial Meissner effect. The
short-ranges modes of propagation of the magnetic field inside the fluid are
characterized by two temp erature dependent penetration lengths.
