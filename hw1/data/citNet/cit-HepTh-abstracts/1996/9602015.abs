  The generalized Killing equations for the configuration space of spinning
particles (spinning space) are analysed. Simple solutions of the homogeneous
part of these equations are expressed in terms of Killing-Yano tensors. The
general results are applied to the case of the four-dimensional euclidean
Taub-NUT manifold.
