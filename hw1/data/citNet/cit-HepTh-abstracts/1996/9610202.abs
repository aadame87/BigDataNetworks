  The canonical quantization of the WZNW model provides a complete set of
exchange relations in the enlarged chiral state spaces that include the Gauss
components of the monodromy matrices. Regarded as new dynamical variables, the
elements of the latter cannot be identified -- they satisfy different exchange
relations. Accordingly, the two dimensional theory expressed in terms of the
left and right movers' fields does not automatically respect monodromy
invariance. Continuing our recent analysis of the problem by gauge theory
methods we conclude that physical states (on which the two dimensional field
acts as a single valued operator) are invariant under the (permuted) coproduct
of the left and right $U_q(sl(n))$. They satisfy additional constraints fully
described for n=2.
