  Recent developments in string duality suggest that the string scale may not
be irrevocably tied to the Planck scale. Two explicit but unrealistic examples
are described where the ratio of the string scale to the Planck scale is
arbitrarily small. Solutions which are more realistic may exist in the
intermediate coupling or ``truly strong coupling'' region of the heterotic
string. Weak scale superstrings have dramatic experimental consequences for
both collider physics and cosmology.
