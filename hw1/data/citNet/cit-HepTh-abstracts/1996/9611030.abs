  We analyse the one-loop fermionic contribution for the scalar effective
potential in the temperature dependent Yukawa model. In order to regularize the
model a mix between dimensional and analytic regularization procedures is used.
We find a general expression for the fermionic contribution in arbitrary
spacetime dimension. It is found that in D=3 this contribution is finite.
