Comments: 11 pages, LaTeX, The result for $N_f=4$ flavors is added, which does
  not agree with Seiberg-Witten's result, but does agree with the result of

  Microscopic tests of the exact results are performed in N=2 SU(2)
supersymmetric QCD. We construct the multi-instanton solution in N=2
supersymmetric QCD and calculate the two-instanton contribution ${\cal F}_2$ to
the prepotential ${\cal F}$ explicitly. For $N_f=1,2$, instanton calculus
agrees with the prediction of the exact results, however, for $N_f=3$, we find
a discrepancy between them.
