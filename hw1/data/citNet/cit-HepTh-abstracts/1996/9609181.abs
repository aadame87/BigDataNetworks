  We present new supersymmetric solutions of D=11 supergravity obtained by
intersecting the brane configuration interpreted as a 2-brane lying within a
5-brane. Some of these solutions can be boosted along a common string and/or
superposed with a Kaluza-Klein monopole. We also present a new embedding of the
extreme four dimensional dyonic black hole with finite horizon area. These
solutions are a consequence of a rather simple set of rules that allow us to
construct the composite M-branes.
