  We identify the states in string theory which are responsible for the entropy
of near-extremal rotating four-dimensional black holes in $N=8$ supergravity.
For black holes far from extremality (with no rotation), the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy is exactly matched by a mysterious duality invariant extension of the
formulas derived for near-extremal black holes states.
