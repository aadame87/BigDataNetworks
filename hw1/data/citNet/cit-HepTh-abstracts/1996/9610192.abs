Title: The Frobenius-Schur indicator in Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Peter Bantay
Comments: 5 pages, TeX, some typos corrected
Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B394 (1997) 87-88
\\
  An analogue of the classical Frobenius-Schur indicator is introduced in order
to distinguish between real and pseudo-real self-conjugate primary fields, and
an explicit expression for this quantity is derived from the trace of the
braiding operator.
