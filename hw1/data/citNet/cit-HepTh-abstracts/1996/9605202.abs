  Using the framework of Nambu's generalised mechanics, we obtain a new
description of constrained Hamiltonian dynamics, involving the introduction of
another degree of freedom in phase space, and the necessity of defining the
action integral on a world sheet. We also discuss the problem of quantising
Nambu mechanics.
