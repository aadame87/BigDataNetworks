  We demonstrate that in addition to the usual fourth-rank superfield $(W_{a b
c d})$ which describes the on-shell theory, a spinor superfield $(J_\a )$ can
be introduced into the 11D geometrical tensors with engineering dimensions less
or equal to one in such a way to satisfy the Bianchi identities in superspace.
The components arising from $J_\a$ are identified as some of the auxiliary
fields required for a full off-shell formulation. Our result indicates that
eleven dimensional supergravity does not have to be completely on-shell. The
$\k\-$symmetry of the supermembrane action in the presence of our partial
off-shell supergravity background is also confirmed. Our modifications to
eleven-dimensional supergravity theory are thus likely relevant for M-theory.
We suggest our proposal as a significant systematic off-shell generalization of
eleven-dimensional supergravity theory.
