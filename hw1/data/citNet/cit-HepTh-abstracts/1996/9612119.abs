  We propose a new supersymmetry in field theory that generalizes standard
supersymmetry and we construct field theoretic models that provide some of its
representations. This symmetry combines a finite number of standard 4D
supersymmetry multiplets into a single multiplet with a new type of
Kaluza-Klein embedding in higher dimensions. We suggest that this mechanism may
have phenomenological applications in understanding family unification. The
algebraic structure, which has a flavor of W-algebras, is directly motivated by
S-theory and its application in black holes. We show connections to previous
proposals in the literature for 12 dimensional supergravity, Yang-Mills, (2,1)
heterotic superstrings and Matrix models that attempt to capture part of the
secret theory behind string theory.
