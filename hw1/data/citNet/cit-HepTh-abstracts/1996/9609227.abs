  Field equations with general covariance are interpreted as equations for a
target space describing physical space time co-ordinates, in terms of an
underlying base space with conformal invariance. These equations admit an
infinite number of inequivalent Lagrangian descriptions. A model for
reparametrisation invariant membranes is obtained by reversing the roles of
base and target space variables in these considerations.
