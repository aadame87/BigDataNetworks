  We consider 3-monopoles symmetric under inversion symmetry. We show that the
moduli space of these monopoles is an Atiyah-Hitchin submanifold of the
3-monopole moduli space. This allows what is known about 2-monopole dynamics to
be translated into results about the dynamics of 3-monopoles. Using a numerical
ADHMN construction we compute the monopole energy density at various points on
two interesting geodesics. The first is a geodesic over the two-dimensional
rounded cone submanifold corresponding to right angle scattering and the second
is a closed geodesic for three orbiting monopoles.
