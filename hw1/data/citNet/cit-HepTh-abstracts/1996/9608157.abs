  It has been argued that the superpotential can be renormalized in the
presence of massless particles. Possible implications which have been
considered include the restoration of supersymmetry at higher loops or a shift
to a supersymmetric vacuum state. We argue that even in the presence of
massless particles, there are no new contributions to the superpotential at any
order in perturbation theory. This confirms the utility of the Wilsonian
superpotential for analyzing the moduli space of the low energy theory.
