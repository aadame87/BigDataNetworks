  We consider a dimensional reduction of 3+1 dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory coupled to adjoint fermions to obtain a class of 1+1 dimensional matrix
field theories. We derive the quantized light-cone Hamiltonian in the
light-cone gauge A_- = 0 and large-N limit, and then solve for the masses,
wavefunctions and structure functions of the color singlet ``meson-like'' and
``baryon-like'' boundstates. Among the states we study are many massless
string-like states that can be solved for exactly.
