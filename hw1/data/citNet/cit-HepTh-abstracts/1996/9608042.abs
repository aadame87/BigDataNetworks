  The numerical input for the quantitative consequences of the electroweak
standard model, the hypercharge and isospin coupling constants and the Higgs
field ground state mass value, are interpreted as normalizations of the
symmetries involved. Using an additional statistical argument, a first order
quantitative determination of the Weinberg angle as a normalization ratio gives
the experimentally acceptable value $\tan^2\th={1\over3}$.
