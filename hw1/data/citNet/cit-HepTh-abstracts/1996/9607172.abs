  We study gaugino condensation in presence of an anomalous $U(1)$ gauge group
and find that global supersymmetry is dynamically broken. An example of
particular interest is provided by effective string models with 4-dimensional
Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism. The structure of the hidden
sector is constrained by the anomaly cancellation conditions and the scale of
gaugino condensation is shifted compared with the usual case. We explicitly
compute the resulting soft supersymmetry breaking terms.
