  I outline various derivations of the non-Abelian Kubo equation, which governs
the response of a quark-gluon plasma to hard thermal perturbations. In the
static case, it is proven that gauge theories do not support hard thermal
solitons. Explicit solutions are constructed within an SU(2) Ansatz and they
are shown to support the general result. The time-dependent problem, i.e.,
non-Abelian plasma waves, has not been completely solved. We express and
motivate the hope that the intimate relations linking the gauge-invariance
condition for hard thermal loops to the equation of motion for T=0, topological
Chern-Simons theory may yield new insight into this field.
