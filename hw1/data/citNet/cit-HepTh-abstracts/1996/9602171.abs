  We use the method of solving the three-anyon problem developed in our earlier
publication to evaluate numerically the third virial coefficient of free
anyons. In order to improve precision, we explicitly correct for truncation
effects. The present calculation is about three orders of magnitude more
precise than the previous Monte Carlo calculation and indicates the presence of
a term $a sin^4 \pi\nu$ with a very small coefficient $a \simeq -1.65 10^{-5}$.
