  I investigate three dimensional abelian and non-abelian gauge theories
interacting with Dirac fermions. Using a variational method I evaluate the
vacuum energy density in the one-loop approximation. It turns out that the
states with a constant magnetic condensate lie below the perturbative ground
state only in the case of three dimensional quantum electrodynamics with
massive fermions.
