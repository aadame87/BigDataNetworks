Title: Unification of Spacetime Symmetries of Massive and Massless Particles
Author: Y.S.Kim
Comments: 7 pages,LaTeX,based on a talk presented at the 2nd German-Polish
  Symposium on New Ideas in the Theory of Fundamental Interactions (Zakopane,
  Poland, September 11-15, 1995)
Journal-ref: Acta Phys.Polon. B27 (1996) 2741-2746

  The internal space-time symmetries of relativistic particles are dictated by
Wigner's little groups. The $O(3)$-like little group for a massive particle at
rest and the $E(2)$-like little group of a massless particle are two different
manifestations of the same covariant little group. Likewise, the quark model
and parton pictures are two different manifestations of the one covariant
entity.
