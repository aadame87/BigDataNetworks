  We present the technique of derivation of a theory to obtain an
$(n+1)f$-degrees-of-freedom theory from an $f$-degrees-of-freedom theory and
show that one can calculate all of the quantities of the derived theory from
those of the original one. Specifically, we show that one can use this
technique to construct, from an integrable system, other integrable systems
with more degrees of freedom.
