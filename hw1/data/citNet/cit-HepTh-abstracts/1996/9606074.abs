  We develop a new operator quantization scheme for gauge theories where no
gauge fixing for gauge fields is needed. The scheme allows one to avoid the
Gribov problem and construct a manifestly Lorentz invariant path integral that
can be used in the non-perturbative domain. We discuss briefly an application
of the method to Abelian projections of QCD.
