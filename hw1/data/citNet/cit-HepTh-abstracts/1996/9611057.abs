  The well known domain wall type solutions are nowadays of great physical
interest in classical field theory. These solutions can mostly be found only
approximately. Recently the Hilbert-Chapman-Enskog method was succesfully
applied to obtain this type solutions in phi**4 theory. The goal of the present
paper is to verify these perturbative results by numerical computations.
