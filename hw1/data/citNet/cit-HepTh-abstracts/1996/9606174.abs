  We present a generalization of the Frolov-Slavnov invariant regularization
scheme for chiral fermion theories in curved spacetimes. local gauge symmetries
of the theory, including local Lorentz invariance. The perturbative scheme
works for arbitrary representations which satisfy the chiral gauge anomaly and
the mixed Lorentz-gauge anomaly cancellation conditions. Anomalous theories on
the other hand manifest themselves by having divergent fermion loops which
remain unregularized by the scheme. Since the invariant scheme is promoted to
also include local Lorentz invariance, spectator fields which do not couple to
gravity cannot be, and are not, introduced. Furthermore, the scheme is truly
chiral (Weyl) in that all fields, including the regulators, are left-handed;
and only the left-handed spin connection is needed. The scheme is, therefore,
well suited for the study of the interaction of matter with all four known
forces in a completely chiral fashion. In contrast with the vectorlike
formulation, the degeneracy between the Adler-Bell-Jackiw current and the
fermion number current in the bare action is preserved by the chiral
regularization scheme.
