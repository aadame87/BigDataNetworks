  The exact quantum integrability aspects of a sector of the membrane is
investigated. It is found that spherical membranes moving in flat target
spacetime backgrounds admit a class of integrable solutions linked to SU(infty)
SDYM equations (dimensionally reduced to one temporal dimension). After a
suitable ansatz, the SDYM equations can be recast in the form of the continuous
Toda molecule equations whose symmetry algebra is the dimensional reduction of
the W (infty} plus {\bar W}(infty} algebra. The latter algebra is explicitly
constructed. Highest weight representations are built directly from the
infinite number of defining relations among the highest weight states of
W(\infty) algebras and the quantum states of the Toda molecule. Discrete states
are also constructed. The full (dimensionaly reduced) quantum SU(infty) YM
theory remains to be explored.
