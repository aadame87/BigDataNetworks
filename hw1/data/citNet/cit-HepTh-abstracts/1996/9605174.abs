  We study the internal dynamics of Ramond-Ramond solitons excited far from the
BPS limit by leading Regge trajectory open strings. The simplest world volume
process for such strings is splitting into two smaller pieces, and we calculate
the corresponding decay rates. Compared to the conventional open superstring,
the splitting of states polarized parallel to the brane is suppressed by powers
of logarithms of the energy. The rate for states polarized transverse to the
brane {\em decreases} with increasing energy. We also calculate the static
force between a D-brane excited by a massive open string and an unexcited
D-brane parallel to it. The result shows that transversely polarized massive
open strings endow D-branes with a size of order the string scale.
