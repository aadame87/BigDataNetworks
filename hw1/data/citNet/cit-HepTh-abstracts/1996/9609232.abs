Title: On Zero-Mass Bound States in Super-Membrane Models
Authors: Jens Hoppe
Comments: 6 pages Latex
\\
  For the simplest case of a supermembrane matrix model, various symmetry
reductions are given, with the fermionic contribution(s) (to an effective
Schr\"odinger equation) corresponding to an attractive $\delta$-function
potential (towards zero-area configurations). The differential equations are
real, and are shown not to admit square-integrable real solutions (even when
allowing non-vanishing boundary conditions at infinity). Complex solutions,
however, are not excluded by this argument.
