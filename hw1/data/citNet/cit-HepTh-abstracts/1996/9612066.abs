  ``Anomalous'' U(1) gauge symmetry with Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation
mechanism is discussed in the orbifold construction of four-dimensional
heterotic string models. Some conditions are given as criteria to have
``anomalous'' U(1) in orbifold string models. In particular, ``anomalous''
U(1) is absent if the massless twisted matter has no mixing between visible
and hidden sectors or if a certain type of discrete symmetries are found. We
then give a general procedure for classifying orbifold models with
``anomalous'' U(1) and for identifying the ``anomalous'' U(1) basis. We
illustrate our procedure in Z_3 and Z_4 orbifold models. According to our
procedure, the classification of ``anomalous'' U(1) can be reduced to the
classification in the absence of a Wilson line. We also discuss discrete
symmetries left unbroken after the ``anomalous'' U(1) breaking. This includes
a possible relation between ``anomalous'' U(1) and discrete R-symmetries.
