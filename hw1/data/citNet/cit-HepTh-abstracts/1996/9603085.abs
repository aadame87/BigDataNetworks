  The duality symmetry group of the cosets ${\textstyle SU(n,1)\over \textstyle
SU(n)\otimes U(1)}$, which describe the moduli space of a two-dimensional
subspace of an orbifold model with $(n-1)$ complex Wilson lines moduli, is
discussed. The full duality group and its explicit action on the moduli fields
are derived.
