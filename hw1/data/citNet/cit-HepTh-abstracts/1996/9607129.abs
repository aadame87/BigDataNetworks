  Based on our earlier work on free field realizations of conformal blocks for
conformal field theories with $SL(2)$ current algebra and with fractional level
and spins, we discuss in some detail the fusion rules which arise. By a careful
analysis of the 4-point functions, we find that both the fusion rules
previously found in the literature are realized in our formulation. Since this
is somewhat contrary to our expectations in our first work based on 3-point
functions, we reanalyse the 3-point functions and come to the same conclusion.
We compare our results on 4-point conformal blocks in particular with a
different realization of these found by O. Andreev, and we argue for the
equivalence. We describe in detail how integration contours have to be chosen
to obtain convenient bases for conformal blocks, both in his and in our own
formulation. We then carry out the rather lengthy calculation to obtain the
crossing matrix between s- and t-channel blocks, and we use that to determine
the monodromy invariant 4-point greens functions. We use the monodromy
coefficients to obtain the operator algebra coefficients for theories based on
admissible representations.
