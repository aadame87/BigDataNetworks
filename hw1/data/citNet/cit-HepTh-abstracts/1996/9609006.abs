  Whereas the usual understanding is that the entropy of only a non-extremal
black hole is given by the area of the horizon, there are derivations of an
area law for extremal black holes in some model calculations. It is explained
here how such results can arise in an approach where one sums over topologies
and imposes the extremality condition after quantization.
