  We present a simplified description of higher antibrackets, generalizations
of the conventional antibracket of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. We show
that these higher antibrackets satisfy relations that are identical to those of
higher string products in non-polynomial closed string field theory.
Generalization to the case of Sp(2)-symmetry is also formulated.
