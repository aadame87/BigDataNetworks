  We examine the proposal made recently that the su(3) modular invariant
partition functions could be related to the geometry of the complex Fermat
curves. Although a number of coincidences and similarities emerge between them
and certain algebraic curves related to triangular billiards, their meaning
remains obscure. In an attempt to go beyond the su(3) case, we show that any
rational conformal field theory determines canonically a Riemann surface.
