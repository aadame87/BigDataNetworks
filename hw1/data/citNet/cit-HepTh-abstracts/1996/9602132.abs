  Convergence of the standard model gauge coupling constants to a common value
at around $2\times 10^{16}$ GeV is studied in the context of orbifold theories
where the modular symmetry groups for $T$ and $U$ moduli are broken to
subgroups of $PSL(2, Z)$. The values of the moduli required for this
unification of coupling constants are studied for this case and also for the
case where string unification is accompanied by unification to a gauge group
larger then $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1).$
