Title: The One Loop Effective Super-Potential and Non-Holomorphicity
Authors: Austin Pickering and Peter West
Comments: LaTeX, 10 pages, 7 figures, uses bezier.sty and ifthen.sty. First
  amendment. The results are extended to include the Kahlerian term for a
  general renormalisable N=1 supersymmetric theory, containing Wess-Zumino and
  Yang-Mills multiplets with a cubic superpotential. One reference has been
  changed and one has been added. Second amendment. One acknowledgment has been
  altered in the `note added in proof'

  We calculate the Kahlerian and the lowest order non-Kahlerian contributions
to the one loop effective superpotential using super-Feynman graphs in the
massless Wess-Zumino Model, the massive Wess-Zumino Model and N=1, U(1) gauge
theory. We also calculate the Kahlerian term in Yang-Mills Theory for a general
gauge group. Using this latter result we find the one loop Kahlerian
contribution for N=2 Yang-Mills Theory in terms of N=1 superfields and we show
that it can only come from non-holomorphic contributions to the N=2 effective
potential.
