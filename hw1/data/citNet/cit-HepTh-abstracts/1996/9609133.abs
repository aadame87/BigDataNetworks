  Massive spinning particle in $6d$-Minkowski space is described as a
mechanical system with the configuration space $R^{5,1} \times CP^3$.
The action functional of the model is unambiguously determined by the
requirement of identical (off-shell) conservation for the phase-space
counterparts of three Casimir operators of Poincar\'e group. The model proves
to be completely solvable. Its generalization to the constant curvature
background is presented. Canonical quantization of the theory leads to the
relativistic wave equations for the irreducible $6d$ fields.
