  The embedding of the isometry group of the coset spaces SU(1,n)/ U(1)xSU(n)
in Sp(2n+2,R) is discussed. The knowledge of such embedding provides a tool for
the determination of the holomorphic prepotential characterizing the special
geometry of these manifolds and necessary in the superconformal tensor calculus
of N=2 supergravity. It is demonstrated that there exists certain embeddings
for which the homogeneous prepotential does not exist. Whether a holomorphic
function exists or not, the dependence of the gauge kinetic terms on the
scalars characterizing these coset in N=2 supergravity theory can be determined
from the knowledge of the corresponding embedding, \`a la Gaillard and Zumino.
Our results are used to study some of the duality symmetries of heterotic
compactifications of orbifolds with Wilson lines.
