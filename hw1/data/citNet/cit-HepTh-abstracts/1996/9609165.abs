  String propagation on a curved background defines an embedding problem of
surfaces in differential geometry. Using this, we show that in a wide class of
backgrounds the classical dynamics of the physical degrees of freedom of the
string involves 2-dim sigma-models corresponding to coset conformal field
theories.
