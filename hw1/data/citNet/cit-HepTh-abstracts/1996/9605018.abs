  Using the BF version of pure Yang-Mills, it is possible to find a covariant
representation of the 't Hooft magnetic flux operator. In this framework, 't
Hooft's pioneering work on confinement finds an explicit realization in the
continuum. Employing the Abelian projection gauge we compute the expectation
value of the magnetic variable and find the expected perimeter law. We also
check the area law behaviour for the Wilson loop average and compute the string
tension which turns out to be of the right order of magnitude.
