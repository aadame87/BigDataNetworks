  We provide a unified construction of the symplectic forms which arise in the
solution of both N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and soliton equations.
Their phase spaces are Jacobian-type bundles over the leaves of a foliation in
a universal configuration space. On one hand, imbedded into finite-gap
solutions of soliton equations, these symplectic forms assume explicit
expressions in terms of the auxiliary Lax pair, expressions which generalize
the well-known Gardner-Faddeev-Zakharov bracket for KdV to a vast class of 2D
integrable models; on the other hand, they determine completely the effective
Lagrangian and BPS spectrum when the leaves are identified with the moduli
space of vacua of an N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory. For SU($N_c$) with
$N_f\leq N_c+1$ flavors, the spectral curves we obtain this way agree with the
ones derived by Hanany and Oz and others from physical considerations.
