  I characterize the structure of the master field for $F^{0}_{z \bar z}$ in
$SU(\infty)$-$YM_4$ on a product of two Riemann surfaces $Z \times W$ in the
gauge $F^{ch}_{z \bar z}=0$ as the sum of a `bulk' constant term and of
delta-like `contact' terms.\\ The contact terms may occur because the
localization of the functional integral at $N=\infty$ on a master orbit of a
constant connection under the action of singular gauge transformations is still
compatible with the large-$N$ factorization and translational invariance.\\ In
addition I argue that if the gauge group is unbroken and there is a mass gap,
that is if the theory confines, the functional measure at $N=\infty$, in the
gauge $F^{ch}_{z \bar z}=0$, must be localized on the moduli space of flat
connections with punctures on $Z \times W$.
