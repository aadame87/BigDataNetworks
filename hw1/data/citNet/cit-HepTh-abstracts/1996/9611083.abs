  A generalized Wakimoto realization of $\widehat{\cal G}_K$ can be associated
with each parabolic subalgebra ${\cal P}=({\cal G}_0 +{\cal G}_+)$ of a simple
Lie algebra ${\cal G}$ according to an earlier proposal by Feigin and Frenkel.
In this paper the proposal is made explicit by developing the construction of
Wakimoto realizations from a simple but unconventional viewpoint. An explicit
formula is derived for the Wakimoto current first at the Poisson bracket level
by Hamiltonian symmetry reduction of the WZNW model. The quantization is then
performed by normal ordering the classical formula and determining the required
quantum correction for it to generate $\widehat{\cal G}_K$ by means of
commutators. The affine-Sugawara stress-energy tensor is verified to have the
expected quadratic form in the constituents, which are symplectic bosons
belonging to ${\cal G}_+$ and a current belonging to ${\cal G}_0$. The
quantization requires a choice of special polynomial coordinates on the big
cell of the flag manifold $P\backslash G$. The effect of this choice is
investigated in detail by constructing quantum coordinate transformations.
Finally, the explicit form of the screening charges for each generalized
Wakimoto realization is determined, and some applications are briefly
discussed.
