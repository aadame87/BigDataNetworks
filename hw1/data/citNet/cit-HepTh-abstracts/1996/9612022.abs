  A novel probe of D-brane dynamics is via scattering of a high energy ripple
traveling along an attached string. The inelastic processes in which the
D-brane is excited through emission of an additional attached string is
considered. Corresponding amplitudes can be found by factorizing a one-loop
amplitude derived in this paper. This one-loop amplitude is shown to have the
correct structure, but extraction of explicit expressions for the scattering
amplitudes is difficult. It is conjectured that the exponential growth of
available string states with energy leads to an inclusive scattering rate that
becomes large at the string scale, due to excitation of the ``string halo,''
and meaning that such probes do not easily see structure at shorter scales.
