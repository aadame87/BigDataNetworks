  Target space duality transformations are considered for bosonic sigma models
and strings away from RG fixed points. A set of consistency conditions are
derived, and are seen to be nontrivially satisfied at one-loop order for
arbitrary running metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton backgrounds. Such
conditions are sufficiently stringent to enable an independent determination of
the sigma model beta functions at this order.
