  In this paper we investigate how various equivalences between effective field
theories of $N=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with matter can be understood through
Higgs breaking, i.e. by giving expectation values to squarks. We give explicit
expressions for the flat directions for a wide class of examples.
