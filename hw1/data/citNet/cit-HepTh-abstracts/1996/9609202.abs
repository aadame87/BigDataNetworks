  We discuss non-Abelian bosonization of two and three dimensional fermions
using a path-integral framework in which the bosonic action follows from the
evaluation of the fermion determinant for the Dirac operator in the presence of
a vector field. This naturally leads to the Wess-Zumino-Witten action for
massless two-dimensional fermions and to a Chern-Simons action for very massive
three dimensional fermions. One advantage of our approach is that it allows to
derive the exact bosonization recipe for fermion currents in a systematic way.
