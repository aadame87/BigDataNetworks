  Using stochastic quantization method we derive equations for correlators of
quantum fluctuations around the classical solution in the massless phi^4
theory. The obtained equations are then solved in the lowest orders of
perturbation theory, and the first correction to the free propagator of a
quantum fluctuation is calculated.
