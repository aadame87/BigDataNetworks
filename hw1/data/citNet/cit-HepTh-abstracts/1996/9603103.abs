  In this paper we show that a quasi-exactly solvable (normalizable or
periodic) one-dimensional Hamiltonian satisfying very mild conditions defines a
family of weakly orthogonal polynomials which obey a three-term recursion
relation. In particular, we prove that (normalizable) exactly-solvable
one-dimensional systems are characterized by the fact that their associated
polynomials satisfy a two-term recursion relation. We study the properties of
the family of weakly orthogonal polynomials defined by an arbitrary
one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable Hamiltonian, showing in particular that
its associated Stieltjes measure is supported on a finite set. From this we
deduce that the corresponding moment problem is determined, and that the $k$-th
moment grows like the $k$-th power of a constant as $k$ tends to infinity. We
also show that the moments satisfy a constant coefficient linear difference
equation, and that this property actually characterizes weakly orthogonal
polynomial systems.
