  For most black holes in string theory, the Schwarzschild radius in string
units decreases as the string coupling is reduced. We formulate a
correspondence principle, which states that (i) when the size of the horizon
drops below the size of a string, the typical black hole state becomes a
typical state of strings and D-branes with the same charges, and (ii) the mass
does not change abruptly during the transition. This provides a statistical
interpretation of black hole entropy. This approach does not yield the
numerical coefficient, but gives the correct dependence on mass and charge in a
wide range of cases, including neutral black holes.
