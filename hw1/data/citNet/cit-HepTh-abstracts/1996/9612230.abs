  Self-dual 2-forms in D=2n dimensions are characterised by an eigenvalue
criterion. The equivalence of various definitions of self-duality is proven. We
show that the self-dual 2-forms determine a n^2-n+1 dimensional manifold S_{2n}
and the dimension of the maximal linear subspaces of S_{2n}$ is equal to the
Radon-Hurwitz number of linearly independent vector fields on the sphere
S^{2n-1}. The relation between the maximal linear subspaces and the
representations of Clifford algebras is noted. A general procedure based on
this relation for the explicit construction of linearly self-dual 2-forms is
given. The construction of the octonionic instanton solution in D=8 dimensions
is discussed.
