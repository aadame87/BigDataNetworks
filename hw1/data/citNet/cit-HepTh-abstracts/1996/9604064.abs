  Roughly speaking, naked singularities are singularities that may be seen by
timelike observers. The Cosmic Censorship conjecture forbids their existence by
stating that a reasonable system of energy will not, under reasonable
conditions, collapse into a naked singularity. There are however many
(classical) counter-examples to this conjecture in the literature. We propose a
defense of the conjecture through the quantum theory. We will show that the
Hawking effect and the accompanying back reaction, when consistently applied to
naked singularities in two dimensional models of dilaton gravity with matter
and a cosmological constant, prevent their formation by causing them to explode
or emit radiation catastrophically. This contrasts with black holes which
radiate slowly. If this phenomenon is reproduced in the four dimensional world,
the explosion of naked singularities should have observable consequences.
