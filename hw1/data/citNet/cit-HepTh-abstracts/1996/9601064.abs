  The question of how to account for the outgoing black hole modes without
drawing upon a transplanckian reservoir at the horizon is addressed. It is
argued that the outgoing modes must arise via conversion from ingoing modes. It
is further argued that the back-reaction must be included to avoid the
conclusion that particle creation cannot occur in a strictly stationary
background. The process of ``mode conversion" is known in plasma physics by
this name and in condensed matter physics as ``Andreev reflection" or ``branch
conversion". It is illustrated here in a linear Lorentz non-invariant model
introduced by Unruh. The role of interactions and a physical short distance
cutoff is then examined in the sonic black hole formed with Helium-II.
