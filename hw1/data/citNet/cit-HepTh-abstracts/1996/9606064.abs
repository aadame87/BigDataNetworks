Title: Exact Wavefunctions for a Delta Function Bose Gas with Higher
  Derivatives
Authors: Eric D. Williams
\\
  A quantum mechanical system describing bosons in one space dimension with a
kinetic energy of arbitrary order in derivatives and a delta function
interaction is studied. Exact wavefunctions for an arbitrary number of
particles and order of derivative are constructed. Also, equations determining
the spectrum of eigenvalues are found.
