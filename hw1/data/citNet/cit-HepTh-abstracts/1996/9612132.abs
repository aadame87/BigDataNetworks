  We discuss the recent developments in the generalized continuous Heisenberg
ferromagnet model formulated as a nonrelativistic field theory defined on the
target space of the coadjoint orbits. Hermitian symmetric spaces are special
because they provide completely integrable field theories in 1+1 dimension and
self-dual Chern-Simons solitons and vortices in 2+1 dimension.
