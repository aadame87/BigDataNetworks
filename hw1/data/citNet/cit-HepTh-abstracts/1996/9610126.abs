  The local SUSY symmetry of the loop dynamics of QCD is found. The remarkable
thing is, there is no einbein-gravitino on this theory, which makes it a 1D
topological supergravity, or locally SUSY quantum mechanics. Using this
symmetry, we derive the large $N_c$ loop equation in momentum superloop space.
Introducing as before the position operator $\X{\mu}$ we argue that the
superloop equation is equivalent to invariance of correlation functions of
products of these operators with respect to certain quadrilinear
transformation. The applications to meson and glueball sectors as well as the
chiral symmetry breaking are discussed. The 1D field theory with Quark
propagating around the loop in superspace is constructed.
