  Using a collective field method, we obtain explicit solutions of the
generalized Calogero-Sutherland models that are characterized by the roots of
the classical groups $B_N$ and $C_N$. Starting from the explicit wave functions
for $A_{N-1}$ type expressed in terms of the singular vectors of the $W_N$
algebra, we give a systematic method to construct wave functions and derive
energy eigenvalues for other types of theories.
