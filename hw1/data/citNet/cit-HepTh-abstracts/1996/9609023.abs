Title: Path-Integral Aspects of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Georg Junker
Notes: Latex 209, amsfonts, 5 pages
\\
  In this talk we briefly review the concept of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics using a model introduced by Witten. A quasi-classical path-integral
evaluation for this model is performed, leading to a so-called supersymmetric
quasi-classical quantization condition. Properties of this quantization
condition are compared with those derived from the standard WKB approach.
