  The quantum energy-momentum tensor ${\hat T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ is computed for
strings in Minkowski space-time. We compute its expectation value for different
physical string states both for open and closed bosonic strings. The states
considered are described by normalizable wave-packets in the center of mass
coordinates. We find in particular that ${\hat T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ is {\bf finite}
which could imply that the classical divergence that occurs in string theory as
we approach the string position is removed at the quantum level as the string
position is smeared out by quantum fluctuations. For massive string states the
expectation value of ${\hat T}^{\mu\nu}(x)$ vanishes at leading order (genus
zero). For massless string states it has a non-vanishing value which we
explicitly compute and analyze for both spherically and cylindrically symmetric
wave packets. The energy-momentum tensor components propagate outwards as a
massless lump peaked at $ r = t $.
