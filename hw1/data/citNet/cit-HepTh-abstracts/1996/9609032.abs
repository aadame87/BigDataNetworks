  The use of complex geometry allows us to obtain a consistent formulation of
octonionic quantum mechanics (OQM). In our octonionic formulation we solve the
hermiticity problem and define an appropriate momentum operator within OQM. The
nonextendability of the completeness relation and the norm conservation is also
discussed in details.
