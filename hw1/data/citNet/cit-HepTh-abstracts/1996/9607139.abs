  We study the BPS states of non-critical strings which arise for zero size
instantons of exceptional groups. This is accomplished by using F-theory and
M-theory duals and by employing mirror symmetry to compute the degeneracy of
membranes wrapped around 2-cycles of the Calabi-Yau threefold. We find evidence
for a number of novel physical phenomena, including having infinitely many
light states with the first lightest state including a nearly massless
gravitino.
