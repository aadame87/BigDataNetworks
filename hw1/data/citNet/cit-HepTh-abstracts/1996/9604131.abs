  In a previous paper, we proposed a construction of $U_q(sl(2))$ quantum group
symmetry generators for 2d gravity, where we took the chiral vertex operators
of the theory to be the quantum group covariant ones established in earlier
works. The basic idea was that the covariant fields in the spin $1/2$
representation themselves can be viewed as generators, as they act, by
braiding, on the other fields exactly in the required way. Here we transform
this construction to the more conventional description of 2d gravity in terms
of Bloch wave/Coulomb gas vertex operators, thereby establishing for the first
time its quantum group symmetry properties. A $U_q(sl(2))\otimes U_q(sl(2))$
symmetry of a novel type emerges: The two Cartan-generator eigenvalues are
specified by the choice of matrix element (bra/ket Verma-modules); the two
Casimir eigenvalues are equal and specified by the Virasoro weight of the
vertex operator considered; the co-product is defined with a matching condition
dictated by the Hilbert space structure of the operator product. This hidden
symmetry possesses a novel Hopf like structure compatible with these
conditions.
 At roots of unity it gives the right truncation. Its (non linear) connection
with the $U_q(sl(2))$ previously discussed is disentangled.
