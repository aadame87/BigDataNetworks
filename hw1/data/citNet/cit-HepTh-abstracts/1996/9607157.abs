  We consider the compactification of type IIB superstring theory on K3
$\times$ K3. We obtain the massless spectrum of the resulting two dimensional
theory and show that the model is free of gravitational anomaly. We then
consider an orbifold and an orientifold projection of the above model and find
that their spectrum match identically and are anomaly-free as well. This gives
a dual pair of type IIB theory in two dimensions and can be understood as a
consequence of SL(2, Z) symmetry of the ten dimensional theory. We also point
out the M-theory duals of the type IIB compactifications considered here.
