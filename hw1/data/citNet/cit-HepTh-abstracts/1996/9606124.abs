Title: The string solution in SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory
Authors: Vladimir Dzhunushaliev and Alexej Fomin

  The tube solutions in Yang - Mills - Higgs theory are received, in which the
Higgs field has the negative energy density. This solutions make up the
discrete spectrum numered by two integer and have the finite linear energy
density. Ignoring its transverse size, such field configuration is the rest
infinity straight string.
