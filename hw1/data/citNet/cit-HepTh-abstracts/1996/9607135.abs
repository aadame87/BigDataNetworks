  We describe a model of massive matter fields interacting through higher-spin
gauge fields in 2+1 dimensional space-time. The two main conclusions are that
the parameter of mass $M$ appears as a module characterizing an appropriate
vacuum solution of the full non-linear model and that $M$ affects a structure
of a global vacuum higher-spin symmetry which leaves invariant the chosen
vacuum solution.
