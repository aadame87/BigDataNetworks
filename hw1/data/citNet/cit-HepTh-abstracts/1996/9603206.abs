  We analyze the effects of soft supersymmetry breaking terms on N=1
supersymmetric QCD with $N_f$ flavors and color gauge group $SU(N_c)$. The mass
squared of some squarks may be negative, as long as vacuum stability is ensured
by a simple mass inequality. For $N_f<N_c$, we include the dynamics of the
non-perturbative superpotential and use the original (s)quark and gauge fields,
while for $N_f>N_c+1$, we formulate the dynamics in terms of dual (s)quarks and
a dual gauge group $SU(N_f-N_c)$. The presence of negative squark mass squared
terms leads to spontaneous breakdown of flavor and color symmetry. We determine
this breaking pattern, derive the spectrum, and argue that the masses vary
smoothly as one crosses from the Higgs phase into the confining phase.
