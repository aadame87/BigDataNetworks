  The truncated 4-dimensional sphere $S^4$ and the action of the
self-interacting scalar field on it are constructed. The path integral
quantization is performed while simultaneously keeping the SO(5) symmetry and
the finite number of degrees of freedom. The usual field theory UV-divergences
are manifestly absent.
