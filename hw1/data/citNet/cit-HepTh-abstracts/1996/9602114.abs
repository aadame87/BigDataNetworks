  We study compactifications of F-theory on certain Calabi--Yau threefolds. We
find that $N=2$ dualities of type II/heterotic strings in 4 dimensions get
promoted to $N=1$ dualities between heterotic string and F-theory in 6
dimensions. The six dimensional heterotic/heterotic duality becomes a classical
geometric symmetry of the Calabi--Yau in the F-theory setup. Moreover the
F-theory compactification sheds light on the nature of the strong coupling
transition and what lies beyond the transition at finite values of heterotic
string coupling constant.
