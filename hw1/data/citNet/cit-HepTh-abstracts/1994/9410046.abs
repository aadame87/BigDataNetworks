Title: Kaluza-Klein Theory in Perspective
Authors: M. J. Duff
Comments: 38 pages latex, NI-94-015
\\
  The Kaluza-Klein idea of extra spacetime dimensions continues to pervade
current attempts to unify the fundamental forces, but in ways somewhat
different from that originally envisaged. We present a modern perspective on
the role of internal dimensions in physics, focussing in particular on
superstring theory. A novel result is the interpretation of Kaluza-Klein string
states as extreme black holes.(Talk delivered at the Oskar Klein Centenary
Nobel Symposium, Stockholm, September 19-21, 1994.)
