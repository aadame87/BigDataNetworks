  Within the context of the recently formulated classical gauge theory of
relativistic p-branes minimally coupled to general relativity in D-dimensional
spacetimes, we obtain solutions of the field equations which describe black
objects. Explicit solutions are found for two cases: D > p+1 (true p-branes)
and D = p+1 (p-bags).
