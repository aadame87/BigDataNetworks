Title: On Renormalization Group Flows and Polymer Algebras
Authors: A. Pordt
Comments: 32 pages, LaTeX, MS-TPI-94-12, Talk presented at the conference
  ``Constructive Results in Field Theory, Statistical Mechanics and Condensed
  Matter Physics'', 25-27 July 1994, Palaiseau, France
\\
  In this talk methods for a rigorous control of the renormalization group (RG)
flow of field theories are discussed. The RG equations involve the flow of an
infinite number of local partition functions. By the method of exact
beta-function the RG equations are reduced to flow equations of a finite number
of coupling constants. Generating functions of Greens functions are expressed
by polymer activities. Polymer activities are useful for solving the large
volume and large field problem in field theory. The RG flow of the polymer
activities is studied by the introduction of polymer algebras. The definition
of products and recursive functions replaces cluster expansion techniques.
Norms of these products and recursive functions are basic tools and simplify a
RG analysis for field theories. The methods will be discussed at examples of
the $\Phi^4$-model, the $O(N)$ $\sigma$-model and hierarchical scalar field
theory (infrared fixed points).
