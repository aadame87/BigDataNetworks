  Recently the quantum hamiltonian reduction was done in the case of general
$s\ell(2)$ embeddings into Lie algebras and superalgebras. In this paper we
extend the results to the quantum hamiltonian reduction of $N=1$ affine Lie
superalgebras in the superspace formalism. We show that if we choose a gauge
for the supersymmetry, and consider only certain equivalence classes of fields,
then our quantum hamiltonian reduction reduces to quantum hamiltonian reduction
of non-supersymmetric Lie superalgebras. We construct explicitly the super
energy-momentum tensor, as well as all generators of spin 1 (and $\hf$); thus
we construct explicitly all generators in the superconformal,
quasi-superconformal and $\Z_2 \times \Z_2$ superconformal algebras.
