  We extend the concept of conjugate vertex operators, first introduced by
Dotsenko in the case of the bosonization of the $su(2)$ conformal field theory,
to the bosonization of the dynamical vertex operators (type II in the
classification of the Kyoto school) of the higher spin XXZ model. We show that
the introduction of the conjugate vertex operators leads to simpler expressions
for the N-point matrix elements of the dynamical vertex operators, that is,
without redundant Jackson integrals that arise from the insertion of screening
charges. In particular, the two-point matrix element can be represented without
any integral.
