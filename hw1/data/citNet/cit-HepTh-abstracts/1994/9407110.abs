Title: The quantum orthogonal mystery
Authors: A.Sudbery
Comments: 15 pages, Latex
\\
  This is (hopefully) a Latexable version of a talk given at the XXX Winter
School in Theoretical Physics at Karpacz in February 1994. It discusses the use
of non-commutative differential calculus to construct a Lie algebra of a
quantum group. Usually the result has a different dimension from the classical
Lie algebra. This is illustrated by menas of the orthogonal quantum group, and
various other possible ways of constructing an orthogonal Lie algebra are
described.
