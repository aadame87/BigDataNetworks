  Blocking transformation is performed in quantum field theory at finite
temperature. It is found that the manner temperature deforms the renormalized
trajectories can be used to understand better the role played by the quantum
fluctuations. In particular, it is conjectured that domain formation and mass
parameter generation can be observed in theories without spontaneous symmetry
breaking.
