  The Lagrangian action for the D4-D5-E6 model of hep-th/9306011 has 8-dim
spacetime V8 of the vector representation of Spin(0,8); 8-dim fermion fields
S8+ = S8- of the half-spinor reps of Spin(0,8); and 28 gauge boson fields of
the bivector adjoint rep of Spin(0,8). In this paper, the structure of the
positive definite Clifford algebra Cl(0,8) of Spin(0,8), and the triality
automorphism V8 = S8+ = S8-, are used to reduce the spacetime to 4 dimensions
and thereby change the gauge group from Spin(0,8) to the realistic
SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1), Higgs, and Gravity. The effect of dimensional reduction on
fermions, to introduce 3 generations, has been described in hep-ph/9301210. The
global geometry of manifolds V8 = S8+ = S8- = RP1xS7, the effects of
dimensional reduction on them, and the calculation of force strength constants,
has been described in hep-th/9302030.
