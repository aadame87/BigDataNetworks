  Using a cohomological characterization of the consistent and the covariant
Lorentz and gauge anomalies, derived from the complexification of the relevant
algebras, we study in $d=2$ the definition of the Weyl determinant for a
non-abelian theory with Riemannian background. We obtain two second order
operators that produce, by means of $\zeta$-function regularization,
respectively the consistent and the covariant Lorentz and gauge anomalies,
preserving diffeomorphism invariance. We compute exactly their functional
determinants and the W-Z-W terms: the ``consistent'' determinant agrees with
the non-abelian generalization of the classical Leutwyler's result, while the
``covariant'' one gives rise to a covariant version of the usual
Wess-Zumino-Witten action.
