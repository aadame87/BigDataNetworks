  Coherent states are introduced and their properties are discussed for all
simple quantum compact groups. The multiplicative form of the canonical element
for the quantum double is used to introduce the holomorphic coordinates on a
general quantum dressing orbit and interpret the coherent state as a
holomorphic function on this orbit with values in the carrier Hilbert space of
an irreducible representation of the corresponding quantized enveloping
algebra. Using Gauss decomposition, the commutation relations for the
holomorphic coordinates on the dressing orbit are derived explicitly and given
in a compact R--matrix formulation (generalizing this way the $q$--deformed
Grassmann and flag manifolds). The antiholomorphic realization of the
irreducible representations of a compact quantum group (the analogue of the
Borel--Weil construction) are described using the concept of coherent state.
The relation between representation theory and non--commutative differential
geometry is suggested.}
