  The derivation of the $ q \bar q $ and the $ 3q $ potential for two dynamical
quarks in a Wilson--loop context is reviewed. Some improvements are introduced.
Only the usual assumptions in the evaluation of the Wilson loop integrals and
expansions in the quark velocities are required for the result. It is shown
that under the same assumptions it is possible to obtain the relativistic
flux--tube lagrangian and a $ q \bar{q}$ Bethe--Salpeter equation with a
confining kernel for spinless quarks. IFUM 482/FT
