  In bosonic end perturbative calculations for quantum mechanical anyon systems
a regularization and renormalization procedure, analogous to those used in
field theory, is necessary. I examine the reliability and the physical
interpretation of the most commonly used bosonic end regularization procedures.
I then use the regularization procedure with the most transparent physical
interpretation to derive some bosonic end perturbation theory results on anyon
spectra, including a 3-anyon ground state energy.
