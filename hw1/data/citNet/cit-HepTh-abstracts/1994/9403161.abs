  We investigate the nucleation of circular cosmic strings in models of
generalized inflationary universes with an accelerating scale factor. We
consider toy cosmological models of a smooth inflationary exit and transition
into a flat Minkowski spacetime. Our results establish that an inflationary
expanding phase is necessary but not sufficient for quantum nucleation of
circular cosmic strings to occur.
