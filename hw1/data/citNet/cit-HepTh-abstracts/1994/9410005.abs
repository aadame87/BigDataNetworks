  In this paper, we examine the conditions under which a higher-spin string
theory can be quantised. The quantisability is crucially dependent on the way
in which the matter currents are realised at the classical level. In
particular, we construct classical realisations for the $W_{2,s}$ algebra,
which is generated by a primary spin-$s$ current in addition to the
energy-momentum tensor, and discuss the quantisation for $s\le8$. From these
examples we see that quantum BRST operators can exist even when there is no
quantum generalisation of the classical $W_{2,s}$ algebra. Moreover, we find
that there can be several inequivalent ways of quantising a given classical
theory, leading to different BRST operators with inequivalent cohomologies. We
discuss their relation to certain minimal models. We also consider the
hierarchical embeddings of string theories proposed recently by Berkovits and
Vafa, and show how the already-known $W$ strings provide examples of this
phenomenon. Attempts to find higher-spin fermionic generalisations lead us to
examine the whether classical BRST operators for $W_{2,{n\over 2}}$ ($n$ odd)
algebras can exist. We find that even though such fermionic algebras close up
to null fields, one cannot build nilpotent BRST operators, at least of the
standard form.
