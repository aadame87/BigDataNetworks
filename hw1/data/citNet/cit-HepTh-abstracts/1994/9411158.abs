  We show that the $N=2$ and $N=4$ SUSY Yang-Mills action can be reformulated
in the sense of non-commutative geometry on $M^4\times (Z_2\oplus Z_2)$ in a
rather simple way. In this way the scalars or pseudoscalars are viewed as gauge
fields along two directions in the space of one-forms on $Z_2\oplus Z_2$.
