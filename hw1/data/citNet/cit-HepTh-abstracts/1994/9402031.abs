  We consider WZW models based on the non-semi-simple algebras that they were
recently constructed as contractions of corresponding algebras for semi-simple
groups. We give the explicit expression for the action of these models, as well
as for a generalization of them, and discuss their general properties.
Furthermore we consider gauged WZW models based on these non-semi-simple
algebras and we show that there are equivalent to non-abelian duality
transformations on WZW actions. We also show that a general non-abelian duality
transformation can be thought of as a limiting case of the non-abelian quotient
theory of the direct product of the original action and the WZW action for the
symmetry gauge group $H$. In this action there is no Lagrange multiplier term
that constrains the gauge field strength to vanish. A particular result is that
the gauged WZW action for the coset $(G_k \otimes H_l)/H_{k+l}$ is equivalent,
in the limit $l\to \infty$, to the dualized WZW action for $G_k$ with respect
to the subgroup $H$.
