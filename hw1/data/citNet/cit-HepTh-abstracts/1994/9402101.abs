  We translate effectively our earlier quantum constructions to the classical
language and using Yang-Baxterisation of the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan
algebra are able to construct Lax operators and associated $r$-matrices of
classical integrable models. Thus new as well as known lattice systems of
different classes are generated including new types of collective integrable
models and canonical models with nonstandard $r$ matrices.
