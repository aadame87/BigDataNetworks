  Franson showed that Aspect's experiment to test Bell's inequality did not
rule out local realistic theories with delayed determinism. A class of local,
deterministic discrete mathematical models with delayed determinism is
described that may be consistent with existing experiments. These are not
hidden variables theories in the sense that they are not theories of particles
plus hidden variables. They are theories of `hidden' distributed information
stored holographic like throughout a space time region. This information cannot
be uniquely associated with individual particles although it determines the
results observed in particle interactions. The classical parameters of an
interaction are determined as {\it focal points} of continuous nonlinear
changes in the wave function and not as discrete events. In addition to not
violating Bell's inequality this class of theories can in principle be
distinguished from standard quantum mechanics by other experiments. These
differences and the experimental constraints on a test of Bell's inequality to
discriminate between the existing theory and this class of models are
discussed.
