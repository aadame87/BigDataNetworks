  The first-order phase transition of $O(3)$ symmetric model is considered in
the limit of high temperature. It is shown that this model supports a new
bubble solution where the global monopole is formed at the center of the buble
in addition to the ordinary $O(3)$ bubble. Though the free energy of it is
larger than that of normal bubble, the production rate can considerably large
at high temperatures.
