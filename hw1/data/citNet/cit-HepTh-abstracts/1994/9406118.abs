Title: Sectors of Mutually Local Fields in Integrable Models of Quantum Field
  Theory

  It is known that 2D field theories admit several sectors of mutually local
fields so as two fields from different sectors are mutually nonlocal. We show
that any one-partical integrable model with ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry contains three
sectors: bosonic, fermionic and `disorder' one. We generalize the form factor
axioms to fermionic and `disorder' sectors. For the particular case of the
sinh-Gordon model we obtain several form factors in these sectors.
