  We examine some of the standard features of primary fields in the framework
of a $q$-deformed conformal field theory. By introducing a $q$-OPE between the
energy momentum tensor and a primary field, we derive the $q$-analog of the
conformal Ward identities for correlation functions of primary fields. We also
obtain solutions to these identities for the two-point function.
