Title: On the Elliptic Genus and Mirror Symmetry

\\
  The elliptic genus for arbitrary two dimensional $N=2$ Landau-Ginzburg
orbifolds is computed. This is used to search for possible mirror pairs of such
models. An important aspect of this work is that there is no restriction to
theories for which the conformal anomaly is $\hat c\in\ZZ$, nor are the results
only valid at the conformal fixed point.
