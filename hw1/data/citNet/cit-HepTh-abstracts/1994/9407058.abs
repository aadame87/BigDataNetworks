  We study the non-critical string field theory with non-orientable string
interactions by using the transfer matrix formalism in the dynamical
triangulation. For any value of $c$ (total central charge of matter), we have
constructed the non-orientable string field theory at the discrete level. Two
coupling constants $G$ and $\Gx$ which satisfy the relation $(\Gx)^3 = G \Gx$
are introduced, where $G$ counts the number of untwisted handles of the
world-sheet while $\Gx$ counts the number of cross-caps. In the case of the
non-critical string theory which correspond to multicritical one matrix models
(including $c=0$ case), we have succeeded in taking the continuum limit, and
then have obtained the continuous string field theory.
