  The actions for all classical (and consequently quantum) $BF$ theories on
$n$-manifolds is proven to be given by anti-commutators of hermitian,
nilpotent, scalar fermionic charges with Grassmann-odd functionals. In order to
show this, the space of fields in the theory must be enlarged to include ``mass
terms'' for new, non-dynamical, Grassmann-odd fields. The implications of this
result on observables are examined.
