  There are only two quantum group structures on the space of two by two
unimodular matrices, these are the $SL_q(2)$ and the $SL_h(2)$ [9-13] quantum
groups. One can not construct a differential geometry on $ SL_q(2)$, which at
the same time is bicovariant, has three generators, and satisfies the Liebnitz
rule. We show that such a differential geometry exists for the quantum group
$SL_h(2)$ and derive all of its properties.
