  It is shown that in the absence of free abelian gauge fields, the conserved
currents of (classical) Yang-Mills gauge models coupled to matter fields can be
always redefined so as to be gauge invariant. This is a direct consequence of
the general analysis of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition for Yang-Mills
theory that we have provided recently.
