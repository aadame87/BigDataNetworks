  The $c=1$ matrix model is equivalent to $1+1$ dimensional string theory.
However, the tachyon self-interaction in the former is local, while in the
latter it is nonlocal due to the gravitational, dilaton and higher string
fields. By studying scattering of classical pulses we show that the appropriate
nonlocal field redefinition converts the local matrix model interaction into
the expected string form. In particular, we see how the asymptotic behavior of
the gravitational field appears in the scattering.
