  A rigorous definition of a path integral for a spinning particle in three
dimensions is given on a regular cubic lattice. The critical diffusion constant
and the associated critical exponents in each spin are calculated. Continuum
field theories such as Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons theories
are constructed near these critical points. The universality of obtained
results is argued on some other lattices.
