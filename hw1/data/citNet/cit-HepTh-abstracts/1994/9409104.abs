  The Wess-Zumino consistency condition for four-dimensional Einstein gravity
is investigated in the space of local forms involving the fields, the ghosts,
the antifields and their derivatives. Its general solution is constructed for
all values of the form degree and of the ghost number. It is shown in
particular that the antifields (= sources for the BRST variations) can occur
only through cohomologically trivial terms.
