  A lattice regularization procedure for gauge theories is proposed in which
fermions are given a special treatment such that all chiral flavor symmetries
that are free of Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies are kept intact. There is no
doubling of fermionic degrees of freedom. A price paid for this feature is that
the number of fermionic degrees of freedom per unit cell is still infinite,
although finiteness of the complete functional integrals can be proven (details
are outlined in an Appendix). Therefore, although perhaps of limited usefulness
for numerical simulations, our scheme can be applied for studying aspects such
as analytic convergence questions, spontaneous symmetry breakdown and baryon
number violation in non-Abelian gauge theories.
