  We discuss a new type of unitary perturbations around conformal theories
inspired by the $\sigma$-model perturbation of the nonunitary WZNW model. We
show that the nonunitary level $k$ WZNW model perturbed by its sigma model term
goes to the unitary level $-k$ WZNW model. When plugged into the gauged WZNW
model the given perturbation results in the perturbed gauged WZNW model which
no longer describes a coset construction. We consider the BRST invariant
generalization of the sigma model perturbation around the gauged WZNW model. In
this way we obtain perturbed coset constructions. In the case of the
$SU_{m-2}(2)\times SU_1(2)/SU_{m-1}(2)$ coset, the BRST invariant sigma model
perturbation is identical to Zamolodchikov's $\Phi_{(3,1)}$ perturbation of the
minimal conformal series. The existence of general geometry flows is clarified.
