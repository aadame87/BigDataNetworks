  We examine the geometrical and topological properties of surfaces surrounding
clusters in the 3--$d$ Ising model. For geometrical clusters at the percolation
temperature and Fortuin--Kasteleyn clusters at $T_c$, the number of surfaces of
genus $g$ and area $A$ behaves as $A^{x(g)}e^{-\mu(g)A}$, with $x$
approximately linear in $g$ and $\mu$ constant. We observe that cross--sections
of spin domain boundaries at $T_c$ decompose into a distribution $N(l)$ of
loops of length $l$ that scales as $l^{-\tau}$ with $\tau \sim 2.2$. We address
the prospects for a string--theoretic description of cluster boundaries. (To

Models and Topological Field Theories", May 1993)
