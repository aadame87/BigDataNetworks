  Time-dependent solutions of bosonic string theory resemble renormalisation
group trajectories in the space of 2d field theories: they often interpolate
between repulsive and attractive static solutions. It is shown that the
attractive static solutions are those whose spatial sections are minima of
|\bar c-25|, where \bar c is the `c-function'. The size of the domain of
attraction of such a solution may be a measure of the probability of the
corresponding string vacuum. Our discussion has also an implication for the RG
flow in theories coupled to dynamical 2d gravity: the flow from models with
c>25 to models with c<25 is forbidden.
