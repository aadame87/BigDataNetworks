  We reinterpret U(N) Chern-Simons-Witten theory quantized on a torus as a free
fermion system. Its Hilbert space and some observables are simply related to
those of group quantum mechanics, even at finite N and k. Its large N limit can
be described using techniques developed for matrix quantum mechanics and
two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We discuss the bosonization of this theory,
which for YM_2 gave a precise interpretation of Wilson loop operators in terms
of string creation and annihilation operators, and examine its consequences for
a string interpretation here. The formalism seems entirely adequate for the
leading large N results and in a sense can be thought of as a `classical string
field theory'. In considering subleading orders in 1/N, we identify some major
differences between CSW and YM_2, which must be dealt with to find a CSW gauge
string interpretation. Although these particular differences are probably not
relevant for `QCD string,' they do illustrate some of the issues there, and we
comment on this. We also propose an approach to dealing with large N
transitions.
