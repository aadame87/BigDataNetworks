  A particular class of random walks with a spin factor on a three dimensional
cubic lattice is studied. This three dimensional random walk model is a simple
generalization of random walk for the two dimensional Ising model. All critical
diffusion constants and associated critical exponents are calculated. Continuum
field theories such as Klein-Gordon, Dirac and massive Chern-Simons theories
are constructed near several critical points.
