  Let $G$ be a semisimple Lie group, ${\frak g}$ its Lie algebra. For any
symmetric space $M$ over $G$ we construct a new (deformed) multiplication in
the space $A$ of smooth functions on $M$. This multiplication is invariant
under the action of the Drinfeld--Jimbo quantum group $U_h{\frak g}$ and is
commutative with respect to an involutive operator $\tilde{S}: A\otimes A \to
A\otimes A$. Such a multiplication is unique. Let $M$ be a k\"{a}hlerian
symmetric space with the canonical Poisson structure. Then we construct a
$U_h{\frak g}$-invariant multiplication in $A$ which depends on two parameters
and is a quantization of that structure.
