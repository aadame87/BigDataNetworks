  The quantization of the induced 2d-gravity on a compact spatial section is
carried out in three different ways. In the three approaches the supermomentum
constraint is solved at the classical level but they differ in the way the
hamiltonian constraint is imposed. We compare these approaches establishing an
isomorphism between the resulting Hilbert spaces.
