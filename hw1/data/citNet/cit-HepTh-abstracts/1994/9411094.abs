  A physical system is in local equilibrium if it cannot be distinguished from
a global equilibrium by ``infinitesimally localized measurements''. This should
be a natural characterization of local equilibrium, but the problem is to give
a precise meaning to the qualitative phrase ``infinitesimally localized
measurements''. A solution is suggested in form of a Local Equilibrium
Condition, which can be applied to linear relativistic quantum field theories
but not directly to selfinteracting quantum fields. The concept of local
temperature resulting from LEC is compared to an old approach to local
temperature based on the principle of maximal entropy. It is shown that the
principle of maximal entropy does not always lead to physical states if it is
applied to relativistic quantum field theories.
