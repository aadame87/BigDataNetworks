  A series of sigma models with torsion are analysed which generate their mass
dynamically but whose ultra-violet fixed points are non-trivial conformal field
theories -- in fact SU(2) WZW models at level $k$. In contrast to the more
familiar situation of asymptotically free theories in which the fixed points
are trivial, the sigma models considered here may be termed ``asymptotically
CFT''. These theories have previously been conjectured to be quantum
integrable; this is confirmed by postulating a factorizable S-matrix to
describe their infra-red behaviour and then carrying out a stringent test of
this proposal. The test involves coupling the theory to a conserved charge and
evaluating the response of the free-energy both in perturbation theory to one
loop and directly from the S-matrix via the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz with a
chemical potential at zero temperature. Comparison of these results provides
convincing evidence in favour of the proposed S-matrix; it also yields the
universal coefficients of the beta-function and allows for an evaluation of the
mass gap (the ratio of the physical mass to the $\Lambda$-parameter) to leading
order in $1/k$.
