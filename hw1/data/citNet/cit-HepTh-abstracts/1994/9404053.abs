  We show that a general miraculous cancellation formula, the divisibility of
certain characteristic numbers and some other topologiclal results are con-
sequences of the modular invariance of elliptic operators on loop spaces.
Previously we have shown that modular invariance also implies the rigidity of
many elliptic operators on loop spaces.
