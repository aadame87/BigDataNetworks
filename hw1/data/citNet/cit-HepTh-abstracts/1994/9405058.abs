  We discuss a construction of highest weight modules for the recently defined
elliptic algebra ${\cal A}_{q,p}(\widehat{sl}_2)$, and make several conjectures
concerning them. The modules are generated by the action of the components of
the operator $L$ on the highest weight vectors. We introduce the vertex
operators $\Phi$ and $\Psi^*$ through their commutation relations with the
$L$-operator. We present ordering rules for the $L$- and $\Phi$-operators and
find an upper bound for the number of linearly independent vectors generated by
them, which agrees with the known characters of $\widehat{sl}_2$-modules.
