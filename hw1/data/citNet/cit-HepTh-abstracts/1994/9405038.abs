  We derive explicit integral formulas for eigenfunctions of quantum integrals
of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser operator with trigonometric interaction
potential. In particular, we derive explicit formulas for Jack's symmetric
functions. To obtain such formulas, we use the representation of these
eigenfunctions by means of traces of intertwining operators between certain
modules over the Lie algebra $\frak gl_n$, and the realization of these modules
on functions of many variables.
