  For realistic values of the Higgs boson mass the high temperature electroweak
phase transition cannot be described perturbatively. The symmetric phase is
governed by a strongly interacting $SU(2)$ gauge theory. Typical masses of
excitations and scales of condensates are set by the ``high temperature
confinement scale'' $\approx 0.2\ T$. For a Higgs boson mass around 100 GeV or
above all aspects of the phase transition are highly nonperturbative. Near the
critical temperature strong electroweak interactions are a dominant feature
also in the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Depending on the value of
the Higgs boson mass the transition may be a first order phase transition or an
analytical crossover.
