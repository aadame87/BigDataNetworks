  It is shown that there exists an isomorphism between q-oscillator systems
covariant under $ SU_q(n) $ and $ SU_{q^{-1}}(n) $. By the isomorphism, the
defining relations of $ SU_{q^{-1}}(n) $ covariant q-oscillator system are
transmuted into those of $ SU_q(n) $. It is also shown that the similar
isomorphism exists for the system of q-oscillators covariant under the quantum
supergroup $ SU_q(n/m) $. Furthermore the cases of q-deformed Lie
(super)algebras constructed from covariant q-oscillator systems are considered.
The isomorphisms between q-deformed Lie (super)algebras can not obtained by the
direct generalization of the one for covariant q-oscillator systems.
