  We present the exact solution of the $Osp(1|2)$ invariant magnet by the Bethe
ansatz approach. The associated Bethe ansatz equation exhibit a new feature by
presenting an explicit and distinct phase behaviour in even and odd sectors of
the theory. The ground state, the low-lying excitations and the critical
properties are discussed by exploiting the Bethe ansatz solution.
