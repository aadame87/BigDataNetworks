  We study the full set of planar Green's functions for a two-matrix model
using the language of functions of non-commuting variables. Both the standard
Schwinger-Dyson equations and equations determining connected Green's functions
can be efficiently discussed and solved. This solution determines the master
field for the model in the `$C$-representation.'
