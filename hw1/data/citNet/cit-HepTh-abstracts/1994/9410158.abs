  We consider the standard vector and chiral gauged WZNW models by their gauged
maximal null subgroups and show that they can be mapped to each other by a
special transformation. We give an explicit expression for the map in the case
of the classical Lie groups $ A_N $, $ B_N $, $ C_N $, $ D_N $, and note its
connection with the duality map for the Riemmanian globally symmetric spaces.
