  Contracting the $h$-deformation of $\SL(2,\Real)$, we construct a new
deformation of two dimensional Poincar\'e algebra, the algebra of functions on
its group and its differential structure. It is also shown that the Hopf
algebra is triangular, and its universal R matrix is also constructed
explicitly. Then, we find a deformation map for the universal enveloping
algebra, and at the end, give the deformed mass shells and Lorentz
transformation.
