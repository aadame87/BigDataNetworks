  Yang-Baxterising a braid group representation associated with multideformed
version of $GL_{q}(N)$ quantum group and taking the corresponding $q\rightarrow
1$ limit, we obtain a rational $R$-matrix which depends on $\left ( 1+ {N(N-1)
\over 2} \right ) $ number of deformation parameters. By using such rational
$R$-matrix subsequently we construct a multiparameter dependent extension of
$Y(gl_N)$ Yangian algebra and find that this extended algebra leads to a
modification of usual asymptotic condition on monodromy matrix $T(\lambda )$,
at $ \lambda \rightarrow \infty $ limit. Moreover, it turns out that, there
exists a nonlinear realisation of this extended algebra through the generators
of original $Y(gl_N)$ algebra.  Such realisation interestingly provides a novel
$\left ( 1 + { N(N-1) \over 2 } \right ) $ number of deformation parameter
dependent coproduct for standard $Y(gl_N)$ algebra.
