  Given a simple Lie algebra $\gggg$, we consider the orbits in $\gggg^*$ which
are of R-matrix type, i.e., which possess a Poisson pencil generated by the
Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau bracket and the so-called R-matrix bracket. We call an
algebra quantizing the latter bracket a quantum orbit of R-matrix type. We
describe some orbits of this type explicitly and we construct a quantization of
the whole Poisson pencil on these orbits in a similar way. The notions of
q-deformed Lie brackets, braided coadjoint vector fields and tangent vector
fields are discussed as well.
