  String theories should reduce to ordinary four-dimensional field theories at
low energies. Yet the formulation of the two are so different that such a
connection, if it exists, is not immediately obvious. With the Schwinger
proper-time representation, and the spinor helicity technique, it has been
shown that field theories can indeed be written in a string-like manner, thus
resulting in simplifications in practical calculations, and providing novel
insights into gauge and gravitational theories. This paper continues the study
of string organization of field theories by focusing on the question of local
duality. It is shown that a single expression for the sum of many diagrams can
indeed be written for QED, thereby simulating the duality property in strings.
The relation between a single diagram and the dual sum is somewhat analogous to
the relation between a old- fashioned perturbation diagram and a Feynman
diagram. Dual expressions are particularly significant for gauge theories
because they are gauge invariant while expressions for single diagrams are not.
