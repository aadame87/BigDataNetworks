  Chern-Simons formulation of 2+1 dimensional Einstein gravity with a negative
cosmological constant is investigated when the spacetime has the topology $
R\times T^{2}$. The physical phase space is shown to be a direct product of two
sub-phase spaces each of which is a non-Hausdorff manifold plus a set with
nonzero codimensions. Spacetime geometrical interpretation of each point in the
phase space is also given and we explain the 1 to 2 correspondence with the ADM
formalism from the geometrical viewpoint. In quantizing this theory, we
construct a "modified phase space" which is a cotangnt bundle on a torus. We
also provide a modular invariant inner product and investigate the relation to
the quantum theory which is directly related to the spinor representation of
the ADM formalism. (This paper is the revised version of a previous
paper(hep-th/9312151). The wrong discussion on the topology of the phase space
is corrected.)
