  There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergent
graphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantum
field theories. Whereupon we present a new method, the inserter regularization
method, to regulate those divergent graphs. In this letter, we demonstrate this
method with the $\phi^4$ theory and QED at the one loop order. Some
applications to SUSY-models are also made at the one loop order, which shows
that supersymmetry is preserved manifestly and consistently.
