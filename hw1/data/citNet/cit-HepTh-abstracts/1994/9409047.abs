  By calculating the response function, we study the Hawking radiation of
massless Dirac fields in the (2+1)-dimensional black hole geometry. We find
that the response function has Planck distributions, with the temperature that
agrees with the previous results obtained for the scalar field cases. We also
find the Green's functions in (2+1)-dimensional Einstein static universe and
anti de-Sitter space.
