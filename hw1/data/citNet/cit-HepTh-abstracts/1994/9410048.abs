  A new Lax equation is introduced for the KP hierarchy which avoids the use of
pseudo-differential operators, as used in the Sato approach. This Lax equation
is closer to that used in the study of the dispersionless KP hierarchy, and is
obtained by replacing the Poisson bracket with the Moyal bracket. The
dispersionless limit, underwhich the Moyal bracket collapses to the Poisson
bracket, is particularly simple.
