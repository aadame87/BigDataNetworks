  ${\bf Z}_2\times {\bf Z}_2$ Coxeter orbifolds are constructed with the
property that some twisted sectors have fixed planes for which the six-torus
can not be decomposed into a direct sum ${\bf T}^2\bigoplus{\bf T}^4 $ with the
fixed plane lying in ${\bf T}^2$. The string loop threshold corrections to the
gauge coupling constants are derived, and display symmetry groups for the $T$
and $U$ moduli that are subgroups of the full modular group $PSL(2,Z)$. The
effective potential for duality invariant gaugino condensate in the presence of
hidden sector matter is constructed and minimized for the values of the moduli.
The effect of Wilson lines on the modular symmetries is also studied.
