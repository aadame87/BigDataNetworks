  We solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for {\it four}-dimensional Einstein
gravity as an expansion in powers of the Planck mass by means of a heat kernel
regularization. Our results suggest that in the universe with a very small
radius or with a very large curvature beyond a Planck scale expectation values
of operators are reduced to calculations in a path integral representation of
{\it three}-dimensional Einstein gravity.
