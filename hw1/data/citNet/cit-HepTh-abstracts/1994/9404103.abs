  Developing ideas based on combinatorial formulas for characteristic classes
we introduce the algebra modeling secondary characteristic classes associated
to $N$ connections. Certain elements of the algebra correspond to the ordinary
and secondary characteristic classes.That construction allows us to give easily
the explicit formulas for some known secondary classes and to construct the new
ones. We write how $i$-th differential and $i$-th homotopy operator in the
algebra are connected with the Poisson bracket defined in this algebra. There
is an analogy between this algebra and the noncommutative symplectic geometry
of Kontsevich. We consider then an algebraic model of the action of the gauge
group. We describe how elements in the algebra corresponding to the secondary
characteristic classes change under this action.
