  Behavior of the Euclidean path integral at large orders of the perturbation
series is studied. When the model allows tunneling, the path-integral
functional in the zero instanton sector is known to be dominated by bounce-like
configurations at large order of the perturbative series, which causes
non-convergence of the series. We find that in addition to this bounce the
perturbative functional has a subleading peak at the instanton and
anti-instanton pair, and its sum reproduces the non-perturbative valley.
