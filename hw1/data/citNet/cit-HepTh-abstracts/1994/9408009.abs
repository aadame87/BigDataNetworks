  The new inversion formula for the Laplace transformation of the tempered
distributions with supports in the closed positive semiaxis is obtained. The
inverse Laplace transform of the tempered distribution is defined by means of
the limit of the special distribution constructed from this distribution. The
weak spectral condition on the Euclidean Green's functions requires that some
of the limits needed for the inversion formula exist for any Euclidean Green's
function with even number of variables. We prove that the initial
Osterwalder--Schrader axioms (1973) and the weak spectral condition are
equivalent with the Wightman axioms.
