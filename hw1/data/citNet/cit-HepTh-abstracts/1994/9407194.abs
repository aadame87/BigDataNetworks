  We construct composite operators in two-dimensional bosonized QCD, which obey
a $W_\infty$ algebra, and discuss their relation to analogous objects recently
obtained in the fermionic language. A complex algebraic structure is
unravelled, supporting the idea that the model is integrable. For singlets we
find a mass spectrum obeying the Regge behavior.
