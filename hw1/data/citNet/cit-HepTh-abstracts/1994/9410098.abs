  We compute the partition function of an anyon-like harmonic oscillator. The
well known results for both the bosonic and fermionic oscillators are then
reobtained as particular cases as ours. The technique we employ is a
non-relativistic version of the Green function method used in the computation
of one-loop effective actions of quantum field theory.
