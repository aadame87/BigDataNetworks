  A real representation theory of real Clifford algebra has been studied in
further detail, especially in connection with Fierz identities. As its
application, we have constructed real octonion algebras as well as related
octonionic triple system in terms of 8-component spinors associated with the
Clifford algebras $C(0,7)$ and $C(4,3)$.
