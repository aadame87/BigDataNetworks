  In their recent letter, Chaichian et.~al. present a Lagrangian for a massive
($m$) point particle on the plane, with which they claim to realize anyon
statistics. However, we find that there are some inaccuracies in their
formulation and, when these are taken care of, well-known results are
reproduced, which already exist in the literature.
