  The $\XXZ$ spin chain with a boundary magnetic field $h$ is considered, using
the vertex operator approach to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. We find explicit
bosonic formulas for the two vacuum vectors with zero particle content. There
are three distinct regions when $h\geq0$, in which the structure of the vacuum
states is different. Excited states are given by the action of vertex operators
on the vacuum states. We derive the boundary $S$-matrix and present an integral
formula for the correlation functions. The boundary magnetization exhibits
boundary hysteresis. We also discuss the rational limit, the $\XXX$ model.
