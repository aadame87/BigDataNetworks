  We develop a rigorous framework for constructing Fock representations of
quantum fields obeying generalized statistics associated with certain solutions
of the spectral quantum Yang-Baxter equation. The main features of these
representations are investigated. Various aspects of the underlying
mathematical structure are illustrated by means of explicit examples.
