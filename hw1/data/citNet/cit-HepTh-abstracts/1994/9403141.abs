  Based on our generalization of the Goulian-Li continuation in the power of
the 2D cosmological term we construct the two and three-point correlation
functions for Liouville exponentials with generic real coefficients. As a
strong argument in favour of the procedure we prove the Liouville equation of
motion on the level of three-point functions. The analytical structure of the
correlation functions as well as some of its consequences for string theory are
discussed. This includes a conjecture on the mass shell condition for
excitations of noncritical strings. We also make a comment concerning the
correlation functions of the Liouville field itself.
