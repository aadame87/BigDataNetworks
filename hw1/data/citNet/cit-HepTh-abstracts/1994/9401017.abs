  We study quantum intergrable systems of interacting particles from the point
of view, proposed in our previous paper. We obtain Calogero-Moser and
Sutherland systems as well their Ruijsenaars relativistic generalization by a
Hamiltonian reduction of integrable systems on the cotangent bundles over
semi-simple Lie algebras, their affine algebras and central extensions of loop
groups respectively. The corresponding 2d field theories form a tower of
deformations. The top of this tower is gauged G/G WZW model on a cylinder with
inserted Wilson line in appropriate representation.
