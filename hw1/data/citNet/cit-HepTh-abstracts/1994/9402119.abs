  We describe mirror manifolds in dimensions different from the familiar case
of complex threefolds. We emphasize the simplifying features of dimension three
and supply more robust methods that do not rely on such special characteristics
and hence naturally generalize to other dimensions. The moduli spaces for
Calabi--Yau $d$-folds are somewhat different from the ``special K\"ahler
manifolds'' which had occurred for $d=3$, and we indicate the new geometrical
structures which arise. We formulate and apply procedures which allow for the
construction of mirror maps and the calculation of order-by-order instanton
corrections to Yukawa couplings. Mathematically, these corrections are expected
to correspond to calculating Chern classes of various parameter spaces (Hilbert
schemes) for rational curves on Calabi--Yau manifolds. Our results agree with
those obtained by more traditional mathematical methods in the limited number
of cases for which the latter analysis can be carried out. Finally, we make
explicit some striking relations between instanton corrections for various
Yukawa couplings, derived from the associativity of the operator product
algebra.
