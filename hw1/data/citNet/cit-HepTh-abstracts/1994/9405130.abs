  We investigate the Ward identities of the $\W_{\infty}$ symmetry in the
super-Liouville theory coupled to the super-conformal matter of central charge
${\hat c}_M = 1-2(p-q)^2 /pq$. The theory is classified into two chiralities.
For the positive chirality, all gravitationally dressed scaling operators are
generated from the $q-1$ gravitational primaries by acting one of the ring
generators in the R-sector on them repeatedly. After fixing the normalizations
of the dressed scaling operators, we find that the Ward identities are
expressed in the form of the {\it usual} $\W_q$ algebra constraints as in the
bosonic case: $\W^{(k+1)}_n \tau =0$, $(k=1,\cdots,q-1 ;~ n \in {\bf Z}_{\geq
1-k})$, where the equations for even and odd $n$ come from the currents in the
NS- and the R-sector respectively. The non-linear terms come from the anomalous
contributions at the boundaries of moduli space. The negative chirality is
defined by interchanging the roles of $p$ and $q$. Then we get the $\W_p $
algebra constraints.
