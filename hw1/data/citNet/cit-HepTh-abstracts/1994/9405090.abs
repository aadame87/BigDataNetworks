  An attempt is made to compare the asymptotic state density of twisted
$p$-branes and the related state density of mass level $M$ of a $D$-dimensional
neutral black hole. To this aim, the explicit form of the twisted $p$-brane
total level degeneracy is calculated. The prefactor of the degeneracy, in
contrast to the leading behaviour, is found to depend on the winding number of
the $p$-brane.
