  Let $V$ be a simple vertex operator algebra and $G$ be a finite nilpotent
group of automorphisms of $V.$ We prove the following in this paper: (1) There
is a Galois correspondence between subgroups of $G$ and the vertex operator
subalgebras of $V$ which contain $V^G$ given by the map $H\mapsto V^H.$ (2)
Assume that for every G\in G$ there is unique simple $g$-twisted $V$-module
$M(g).$ Then there exists a Hochschild 3-cocycle $\alpha$ on the integral group
$Z[G]$ such that there is an equivalence of categories between $V^G$-module
category (whose objects are $V^G$-submodules of direct sums of copies of
$\oplus_{g\in G}M(g),$ and whose morphisms are $V^G$-module homomorphisms) and
the module category for the twisted quantum double $D_{\alpha}(G)$ associated
to $\alpha.$
