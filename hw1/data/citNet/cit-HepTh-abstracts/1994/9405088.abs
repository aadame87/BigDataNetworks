  It is shown how the BRST quantization can be applied to a gauge invariant
sector of theories with anomalously broken symmetries. This result is used to
show that shifting the anomalies to a classically trivial sector of fields
(Wess-Zumino mechanism) makes it possible to quantize the physical sector using
a standard BRST procedure, as for a non anomalous theory. The trivial sector
plays the role of a topological sector if the system is quantized without
shifting the anomalies.
