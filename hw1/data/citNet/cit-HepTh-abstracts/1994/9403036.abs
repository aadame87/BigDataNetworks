  Developing upon the ideas of ref. \ref{6}, it is shown how the theory of
classical $W$ algebras can be formulated on a higher genus Riemann surface in
the spirit of Krichever and Novikov. The basic geometric object is the
Drinfeld--Sokolov principal bundle $L$ associated to a simple complex Lie group
$G$ equipped with an $SL(2,\Bbb C)$ subgroup $S$, whose properties are studied
in detail. On a multipunctured Riemann surface, the
Drinfeld--Sokolov--Krichever--Novikov spaces are defined, as a generalization
of the customary Krichever--Novikov spaces, their properties are analyzed and
standard bases are written down. Finally, a WZWN chiral phase space based on
the principal bundle $L$ with a KM type Poisson structure is introduced and, by
the usual procedure of imposing first class constraints and gauge fixing, a
classical $W$ algebra is produced. The compatibility of the construction with
the global geometric data is highlighted.
