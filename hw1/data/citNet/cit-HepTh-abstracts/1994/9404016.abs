  The time dependent-integrals of motion, linear in position and momentum
operators, of a quantum system are extracted from Noether's theorem
prescription by means of special time-dependent variations of coordinates. For
the stationary case of the generalized two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the
time-independent integrals of motion are shown to correspond to special
Bragg-type symmetry properties. A detailed study for the non-stationary case of
this quantum system is presented. The linear integrals of motion are
constructed explicitly for the case of varying mass and coupling strength. They
are obtained also from Noether's theorem. The general treatment for a
multi-dimensional quadratic system is indicated, and it is shown that the
time-dependent variations that give rise to the linear invariants, as conserved
quantities, satisfy the corresponding classical homogeneous equations of motion
for the coordinates.
