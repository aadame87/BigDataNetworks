  We discuss the phase structure of a higher derivative four-fermion model in
four dimensions in curved spacetime in frames of the $\frac{1}{N_c}$-expansion.
First, we evaluate in our model the effective potential of two composite
scalars in the linear curvature approximation using a local momentum
representation in curved spacetime for the higher-derivative propagator which
naturally appears. The symmetry breaking phenomenon and phase transition
induced by curvature are numerically investigated. A numerical study of the
dynamically generated fermionic mass, which depends on the coupling constants
and on the curvature, is also presented.
