  We determine the canonical structure of two-dimensional black-hole solutions
arising in $2D$ dilaton gravity. By choosing the Cauchy surface appropriately
we find that the canonically conjugate variable to the black hole mass is given
by the difference of local (Schwarzschild) time translations at right and left
spatial infinities. This can be regarded as a generalization of Birkhoff's
theorem.
