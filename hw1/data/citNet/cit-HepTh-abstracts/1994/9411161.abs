Title: A Look at the Discretized Superstring Using Random Matrices
Author: Parthasarathi Majumdar
Report-no: IMSc-94/25
Comments: 12 pages, latex file, no figures. Based on a talk given at the II
  International Colloquium in Modern Quantum Field Theory at Bombay, India,
  January 5-11, 1994, to appear in the Proceedings
\\
  Beginning with a review of the arguments leading to the so-called c=1 barrier
in the continuum formulation of noncritical string theory, the pathology is
then exhibited in a discretized version of the theory, formulated through
dynamical triangulation of two dimensional random surfaces. The effect of
embedding the string in a superspace with fermionic coordinates is next studied
in some detail. Using techniques borrowed from the theory of random matrices,
indirect arguments are presented to establish that such an embedding may
stabilize the two dimensional world sheet against degeneration into a branched
polymer-like structure, thereby leading to a well-defined continuum string
theory in a spacetime of dimension larger than 2.
