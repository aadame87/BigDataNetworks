  \noindent Using hydrodynamic collective field theory approach we show that
one-particle density matrix of the $\nu=1/m$ fractional quantum Hall edge state
interpolates between chiral Luttinger liquid behavior $\langle
\psi^{\dagger}(r) \psi(0) \rangle \sim r^{-m} $ and Calogero-Sutherland model
behavior $\langle \psi^{\dagger}(r) \psi(0) \rangle \sim r^{-(m+1/m)/2} $ as
the droplet width is varied continuously. Low-energy excitations are described
by $c=1$ conformal field theory of a compact boson of radius $\sqrt m$. The
result suggests complementary relation between the two-dimensional quantum Hall
droplet and the one-dimensional Calogero-Sutherland model.
