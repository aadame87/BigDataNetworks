  It is shown that Weyl spinors in 4D Minkowski space are composed of primary
fields of half-integer conformal weights. This yields representations of
fermionic 2-point functions in terms of correlators of primary fields with a
factorized transformation behavior under the Lorentz group. I employ this
observation to determine the general structure of the corresponding Lorentz
covariant correlators by methods similar to the methods employed in conformal
field theory to determine 2- and 3-point functions of primary fields. In
particular, the chiral symmetry breaking terms resemble fermionic 2-point
functions of 2D CFT up to a function of the product of momenta. The
construction also permits for the formulation of covariant meromorphy
constraints on spinors in 3+1 dimensions.
