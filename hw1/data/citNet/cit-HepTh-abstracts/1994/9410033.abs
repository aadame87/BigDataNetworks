Title: Lattice models and generalized Rogers Ramanujan identities
Authors: Doron Gepner (Caltech)
Journal-ref: Phys.Lett. B348 (1995) 377-385
\\
  We revisit the solvable lattice models described by Andrews Baxter and
Forrester and their generalizations. The expressions for the local state
probabilities were shown to be related to characters of the minimal models. We
recompute these local state probabilities by a different method. This yields
generalized Rogers Ramanujan identities, some of which recently conjectured by
Kedem et al. Our method provides a proof for some cases, as well as generating
new such identities.
