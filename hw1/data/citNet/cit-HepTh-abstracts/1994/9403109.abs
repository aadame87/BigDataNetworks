  Generalized coherent states provide a means of connecting square integrable
representations of a semi-simple Lie group with the symplectic geometry of some
of its homogeneous spaces. In the first part of the present work this point of
view is extended to the supersymmetric context, through the study of the
OSp(2/2) coherent states. These are explicitly constructed starting from the
known abstract typical and atypical representations of osp(2/2). Their
underlying geometries turn out to be those of supersymplectic OSp(2/2)
homogeneous spaces. Moment maps identifying the latter with coadjoint orbits of
OSp(2/2) are exhibited via Berezin's symbols. When considered within
Rothstein's general paradigm, these results lead to a natural general
definition of a super K\"ahler supermanifold, the supergeometry of which is
determined in terms of the usual geometry of holomorphic Hermitian vector
bundles over K\"ahler manifolds. In particular, the supergeometry of the above
orbits is interpreted in terms of the geometry of Einstein-Hermitian vector
bundles. In the second part, an extension of the full geometric quantization
procedure is applied to the same coadjoint orbits. Thanks to the super K\"ahler
character of the latter, this procedure leads to explicit super unitary
irreducible representations of OSp(2/2) in super Hilbert spaces of $L^2$
superholomorphic sections of prequantum bundles of the Kostant type. This work
lays the foundations of a program aimed at classifying Lie supergroups'
coadjoint orbits and their associated irreducible representations, ultimately
leading to harmonic superanalysis. For this purpose a set of consistent
conventions is exhibited.
