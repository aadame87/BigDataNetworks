  It has been proposed by Atiyah and Manton that the dynamics of Skyrmions may
be approximated by motion on a finite dimensional manifold obtained from the
moduli space of SU(2) Yang-Mills instantons. Motivated by this work we describe
how similar results exist for other soliton and instanton systems. We describe
in detail two examples for the approximation of the infinite dimensional
dynamics of sine-Gordon solitons by finite dimensional dynamics on a manifold
obtained from instanton moduli. In the first example we use the moduli space of
CP1 instantons and in the second example we use the moduli space of SU(2)
Yang-Mills instantons. The metric and potential functions on these manifolds
are constructed and the resulting dynamics is compared with the explicit exact
soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon theory.
