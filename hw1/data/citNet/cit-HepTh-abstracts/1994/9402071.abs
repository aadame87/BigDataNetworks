Title: The Real Test of ``Triviality'' on the Lattice

\\
  The generally accepted ``triviality'' of $\lambda\Phi^4$ theories does not
forbid Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking but implies a trivially free shifted field
which becomes effectively governed by a quadratic hamiltonian. As a
consequence, one expects the one-loop potential to be exact . We present a
lattice computation of the effective potential for massless $\lambda\Phi^4$
theory which nicely confirms the expectations based on ``triviality''. Our
results imply that the magnitude of the Higgs boson mass, beyond perturbation
theory, does not represent a measure of the observable interactions in the
scalar sector of the standard model.
