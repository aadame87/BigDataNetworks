  We argue that string theory should have a formulation for which stability and
causality are evident. Rather than regard strings as fundamental objects, we
suggest they should be regarded as composite systems of more fundamental
point-like objects. A tentative scheme for such a reinterpretation is described
along the lines of 't Hooft's $1/N$ expansion and the light-cone
parametrization of the string.
