Title: Creation of a scalar potential in 2D dilaton gravity
Authors: K. Behrndt
Comments: talk presented at MG 7, 4 Pages, latex, SLAC-PUB-6673

  We investigate quantum corrections of the 2-d dilaton gravity near the
singularity. Our motivation comes from a s-wave reduced cosmological solution
which is classically singular in the scalar fields (dilaton and moduli). As
result we find, that the singularity disappears and a dilaton/moduli potential
is created.
