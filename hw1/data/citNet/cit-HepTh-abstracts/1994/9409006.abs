  We study the various quantum aspects of the $N=2$ supersymmetric Maxwell
Chern-Simons vortex systems. The fermion zero modes around the vortices will
give rise the degenerate states of vortices. We analyze the angular momentum of
these zero modes and apply the result to get the supermultiplet structures of
the vortex. The leading quantum correction to the mass of the vortex coming
from the mode fluctuations is also calculated using various methods depending
on the value of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term $\kappa$ to be zero,
infinite and finite, separately. The mass correction is shown to vanish for all
cases. Fermion numbers of vortices are also discussed.
