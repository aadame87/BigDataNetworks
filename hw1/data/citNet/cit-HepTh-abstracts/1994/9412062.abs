  Massive integrable field theories in $1+1$ dimensions are defined at the
Lagrangian level, whose classical equations of motion are related to the
``non-abelian'' Toda field equations. They can be thought of as generalizations
of the sine-Gordon and complex sine-Gordon theories. The fields of the theories
take values in a non-abelian Lie group and it is argued that the coupling
constant is quantized, unlike the situation in the sine-Gordon theory, which is
a special case since its field takes values in an abelian group. It is further
shown that these theories correspond to perturbations of certain coset
conformal field theories. The solitons in the theories will, in general, carry
non-abelian charges.
