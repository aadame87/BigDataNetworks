  We construct a relativistically covariant symmetry of QED. Previous local and
nonlocal symmetries are special cases. This generalized symmetry need not be
nilpotent, but nilpotency can be arranged with an auxiliary field and a certain
condition. The Noether charge generating the symmetry transformation is
obtained, and it imposes a constraint on the physical states.
