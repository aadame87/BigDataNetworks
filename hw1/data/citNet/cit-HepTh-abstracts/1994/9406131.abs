  By using a bosonization we uncover the topological gravity structure of
Labastida, Pernici and Witten in ordinary $2d$ gravity coupled to $(p,q)$
minimal models. We study the cohomology class associated with the fermionic
charge of the topological gravity which is shown to be isomorphic to that of
the total $BRST$ charge. One of the ground ring generators of $c_M <1$ string
theory is found to be in the equivariant cohomology of this fermionic charge.
