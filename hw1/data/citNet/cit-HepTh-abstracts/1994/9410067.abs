  We apply a simple mean field like variational calculation to compact QED in
2+1 dimensions. Our variational ansatz explicitly preserves compact gauge
invariance of the theory. We reproduce in this framework all the known results,
including dynamical mass generation, Polyakov scaling and the nonzero string
tension. It is hoped that this simple example can be a useful reference point
for applying similar approximation techniques to nonabelian gauge theories.
