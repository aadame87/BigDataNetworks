  Rigidly superconformal sigma models in higher than two dimensions are
constructed. These models rely on the existence of conformal Killing spinors on
the $p+1$ dimensional worldvolume $(p\le 5)$, and homothetic conformal Killing
vectors in the $d$--dimensional target space. In the bosonic case, substituting
into the action a particular form of the target space metric admitting such
Killing vectors, we obtain an action with manifest worldvolume conformal
symmetry, which describes the coupling of $d-1$ scalars to a conformally flat
metric on the worldvolume. We also construct gauged sigma models with
worldvolume conformal supersymmetry. The models considered here are
generalizations of the singleton actions on $S^p\times S^1$, constructed
sometime ago by Nicolai and these authors.
