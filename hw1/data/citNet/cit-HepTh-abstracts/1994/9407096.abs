Title: On the string equation at $c=1$
Authors: Toshio Nakatsu
Comments: 17pp,INS-Rep.1043, to appear in Mod.Phys.Lett.A, Some modifications
  have been performed from the view of the double scaled field theory.And also
  the relation with the classical (genus 0) results is described
Journal-ref: Mod.Phys.Lett. A9 (1994) 3313-3324
\\
  The analogue of the string equation which specifies the partition function of
$c=1$ string with a compactification radius $\beta \in \mbox{$\bf{Z}$}_{\geq 1}
$ is described in the framework of the Toda lattice hierarchy.
