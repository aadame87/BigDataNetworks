  For the `classical' formulation of a massive spinning particle, the
propagator is obtained along with the spin factor. We treat the system with two
kinds of constraints that were recently shown to be concerned with the
reparametrization invariance and `quasi-supersymmetry'. In the path integral,
the BRST invariant Lagrangian is used and the same spin factor is obtained as
in the pseudo-classical formulation.
