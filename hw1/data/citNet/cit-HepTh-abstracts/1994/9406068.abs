  We investigate an equivariant generalization of Morse theory for a general
class of integrable models. In particular, we derive equivariant versions of
the classical Poincar\'e-Hopf and Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorems and present the
corresponding path integral generalizations. Our approach is based on
equivariant cohomology and localization techniques, and is closely related to
the formalism developed by Matthai and Quillen in their approach to Gaussian
shaped Thom forms.
