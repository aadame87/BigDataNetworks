  A class of two-dimensional globally scale-invariant, but not conformally
invariant, theories is obtained. These systems are identified in the process of
discussing global and local scaling properties of models related by duality
transformations, based on non-semisimple isometry groups. The construction of
the dual partner of a given model is followed through; non-local as well as
local versions of the former are discussed.
