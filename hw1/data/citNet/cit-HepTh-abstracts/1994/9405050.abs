Title: Topics in Hidden Symmetries
Authors: Denis Juriev
Comments: 11 pages AMSTEX, amsppt style
Subj-class: High Energy Physics - Theory; Algebraic Geometry
\\
  These three topics are an attempt to explicate some curiosities of the
inverse problem of representation theory (i.e. having a set of operators to
describe the "correct" algebraic object, which is represented by them) on
simple examples related to the Lie algebra sl(2,C). Such consideration maybe
regarded as toy one for analogous infinite dimensional problems in the modern
quantum field theory (conformal field theory, integrable models, field theory
in non-trivial backgrounds). Some constructions inspired by these topics and
related to infinite dimensional hidden symmetries, which are produced by vertex
operator fields, will be discussed in the forthcoming article.
