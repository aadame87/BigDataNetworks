  The quantum super Yangian $Y_q(gl(M|N))$ associated with the Perk - Schultz
solution of the Yang - Baxter equation is introduced. Its structural properties
are investigated, in particular, an extensive study of its central algebra is
carried out. A $Z_2$ graded associative algebra epimorphism $Y_q(gl(M|N))-->
U_q(gl(M|N))$ is established and constructed explicitly. Images of the central
elements of the quantum super Yangian under this epimorphism yield the Casimir
operators of the quantum supergroup $U_q(gl(M|N))$ constructed in an earlier
publication.
