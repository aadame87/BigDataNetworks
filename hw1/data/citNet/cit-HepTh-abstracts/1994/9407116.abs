  The Hilbert space of a free massless particle moving on a group manifold is
studied in details using canonical quantisation. While the simplest model is
invariant under a global symmetry, $G \times G$, there is a very natural way to
``factorise" the theory so that only one copy of the global symmetry is
preserved. In the case of $G=SU(2)$, a simple deformation of the quantised
theory is proposed to give a realisation of the quantum group, $U_t(SL(2))$.
The symplectic structures of the corresponding classical theory is derived.
This can be used, in principle, to obtain a Lagrangian formulation for the
$U_t(SL(2))$ symmetry.
