  Spontaneous $CP$ Violation Toy Model

  In the spirit of Non-commutative differential calculus on discrete group, we
construct a toy model of spontaneous $CP$ violation (SCPV). Our model is
different from the well-known Weinberg-Branco model although it involves three
Higgs doublets and preserve neutral flavor current conservation (NFC) after
using the $Z_2 \ti Z_2 \ti Z_2$ discrete symmetry and imposing some constraints
on Yukawa couplings.
