Title: Renormalization Group Approach to Scalar Theory
Authors: Sen-Ben Liao and Chengqian Gong

\\
  Effective potential for scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory is obtained using the
exact renormalization group method which includes both the usual one-loop
contribution as well as the dominant higher loop effects. Our numerical
calculation indicates a breakdown of naive one-loop result for sufficiently
large renormalized coupling constant.
