  The symmetry algebra of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with
rational ratio of frequencies is identified as a non-linear extension of the
u(2) algebra. The finite dimensional representation modules of this algebra are
studied and the energy eigenvalues are determined using algebraic methods of
general applicability to quantum superintegrable systems.
