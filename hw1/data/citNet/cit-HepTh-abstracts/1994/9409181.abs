Title: Kink Chains from Instantons on a Torus

  We describe how the procedure of calculating approximate solitons from
instanton holonomies may be extended to the case of soliton crystals. It is
shown how sine-Gordon kink chains may be obtained from CP1 instantons on a
torus. These kink chains turn out to be remarkably accurate approximations to
the true solutions. Some remarks on the relevance of this work to Skyrme
crystals are also made.
