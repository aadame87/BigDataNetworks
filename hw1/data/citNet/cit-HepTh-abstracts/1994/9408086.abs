  We prove $q$-series identities between bosonic and fermionic representations
of certain Virasoro characters.  These identities include some of the
conjectures made by the Stony Brook group as special cases. Our method is a
direct application of Andrews' extensions of Bailey's lemma to recently
obtained polynomial identities.
