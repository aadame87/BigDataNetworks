  We present the anyon equation on a cylinder and in an infinite potential wall
from the abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to non-relativistic matter field
by obtaining the effective hamiltonian through the canonical transformation
method used for the theory on a plane and on a torus. We also give the periodic
property of the theory on the cylinder.
