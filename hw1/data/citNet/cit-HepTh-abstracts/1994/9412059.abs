  Using the general theory of [10] ( hep-th 9412058 ), quantum Poincar\'e
groups (without dilatations) are described and investigated. The description
contains a set of numerical parameters which satisfy certain polynomial
equations. For most cases we solve them and give the classification of quantum
Poincar\'e groups. Each of them corresponds to exactly one quantum Minkowski
space. The Poincar\'e series of these objects are the same as in the classical
case. We also classify possible $R$-matrices for the fundamental representation
of the group.
