  The properties of the three-dimensional noncanonical osp(3/2) oscillators,
introduced in J.Phys. A: Math. Gen. {\bf 27} (1994) 977, are further studied.
The angular momentum M of the oscillators can take at most three values
M=p-1,p,p+1, which are either all integers or all half-integers. The
coordinates anticommute with each other. Depending on the state space the
energy spectrum can coincide or can be essentially different from those of the
canonical oscillator. The ground state is in general degenerated.
