  It is shown that a static $(1+3)$ anti-de Sitter metric defines, in a natural
way, a relativistic harmonic oscillator in Minkowski space. The quantum theory
can be solved exactly and leads to wave functions having a significantly
different behaviour with respect to the non-relativistic ones. The energy
spectrum coincides, up to the ground state energy, with that of the
non-relativistic oscillator.
