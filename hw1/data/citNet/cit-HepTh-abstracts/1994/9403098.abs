Title: Large Improved Wick Rotation Prescription in Stochastic Quantization of
  Dissipative Systems
Authors: Naohito Nakazawa and Eisaku Sakane
\\
  We apply Stochastic Quantization Method to dissipative systems at finite
temperature. Especially, the relation of SQM to the Caldeira-Leggett model is
clarified ensuring that the naive Wick rotation is improved in this context. We
show that the Langevin system obtained by the \lq\lq Improved Wick Rotation "
prescription is equivalent to an ideal friction case ( low temperature limit)
in the C-L model. We derive, based on our approach, a general formula on the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem for higher derivative frictions.
