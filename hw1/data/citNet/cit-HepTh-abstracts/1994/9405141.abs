  The edge states of a sample displaying the quantum Hall effect (QHE) can be
described by a 1+1 dimensional (conformal) field theory of $d$ massless scalar
fields taking values on a $d$-dimensional torus. It is known from the work of
Naculich, Frohlich et al.\@ and others that the requirement of chirality of
currents in this \underline{scalar} field theory implies the Schwinger anomaly
in the presence of an electric field, the anomaly coefficient being related in
a specific way to Hall conducvivity. The latter can take only certain
restricted values with odd denominators if the theory admits fermionic states.
We show that the duality symmetry under the $O(d,d;{\bf Z})$ group of the free
theory transforms the Hall conductivity in a well-defined way and relates
integer and fractional QHE's. This means, in particular, that the edge spectra
for dually related Hall conductivities are identical, a prediction which may be
experimentally testable. We also show that Haldane's hierarchy as well as
certain of Jain's fractions can be reproduced from the Laughlin fractions using
the duality transformations. We thus find a framework for a unified description
of the QHE's occurring at different fractions. We also give a derivation of the
wave functions for fractions in Haldane's hierarchy.
