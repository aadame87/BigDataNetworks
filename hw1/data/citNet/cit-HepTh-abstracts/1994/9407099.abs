Title: Exact string solutions and duality
Authors: A.A. Tseytlin

  We review known exact classical solutions in (bosonic) string theory. The
main classes of solutions are `cosets' (gauged WZW models), `plane wave'-type
backgrounds (admitting a covariantly constant null Killing vector) and
`$F$-models' (backgrounds with two null Killing vectors generalising the
`fundamental string' solution). The recently constructed $D=4$ solutions with
Minkowski signature are given explicitly. We consider various relations between
these solutions and, in particular, discuss some aspects of the duality
symmetry. [To appear in the Proceedings of the 2nd Journe'e Cosmologie,
