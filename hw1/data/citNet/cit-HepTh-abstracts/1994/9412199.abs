  In these lectures, we study and compare two different formulations of
$SU(2)$, level $k=1$, Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. The first,
conventional, formulation employs the affine symmetry of the model; in this
approach correlation functions are derived from the so-called
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The second formulation is based on an
entirely different algebraic structure, the so-called Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. In
this approach, the Hilbert space of the theory is obtained by repeated
application of modes of the so-called spinon field, which has $SU(2)$ spin
$j=\thalf$ and obeys fractional (semionic) statistics. We show how this new
formulation, which can be generalized to many other rational conformal field
theories, can be used to compute correlation functions and to obtain new
expressions for the Virasoro and affine characters in the theory. [Lectures
