  Using the effective potential, we study the one-loop renormalization of a
massive self-interacting scalar field at finite temperature in flat manifolds
with one or more compactified spatial dimensions. We prove that, owing to the
compactification and finite temperature, the renormalized physical parameters
of the theory (mass and coupling constant) acquire thermal and topological
contributions. In the case of one compactified spatial dimension at finite
temperature, we find that the corrections to the mass are positive, but those
to the coupling constant are negative. We discuss the possibility of
triviality, i.e. that the renormalized coupling constant goes to zero at some
temperature or at some radius of the compactified spatial dimension.
