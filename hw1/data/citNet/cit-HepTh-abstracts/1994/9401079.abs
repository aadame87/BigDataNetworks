  It is shown that the inhomogeneous saddle points of scale invariant theories
make the semiclassical expansion sensitive on the choice of non-renormalizable
operators. In particular, the instanton fugacity and the beta function of the
two dimensional non-linear sigma model depends on apparently non-renormalizable
operators. This represents a non-perturbative breakdown of that concept of
universality which is based on low dimensional operators.
