Title: Yang-Baxterization of the BH algebra

  The BH algebra is defined by two sets of generators one of which satisfy the
relations of the braid group and the other the relations of the Hecke algebra
of projectors.These algebras are then combined by additional relations in a way
which generalizes the Birman-Wenzl algebra.In this paper we Yang-Baxterize the
algebra BH and compute solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.The solutions
found are expressed algebraically in terms of the generators of the algebra.The
expression generalizes the known one for the Birman-Wenzl algebra.
