Title: Structure of Lorentzian algebras and Conformal Field Theory
Authors: V. Marotta and A. Sciarrino
Comments: 37 pages and 4 figures (not enclosed), Latex, DSF-T-93/44
\\
  The main properties of indefinite Kac-Moody and Borcherds algebras,
considered in a unified way as Lorentzian algebras, are reviewed. The
connection with the conformal field theory of the vertex operator construction
is discussed. By the folding procedure a class of subalgebras is obtained.
