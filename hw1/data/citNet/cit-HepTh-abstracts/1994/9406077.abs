  The Painlev\'e transcendents $P_{\rom{I}}$--$P_{\rom{V}}$ and their
representations as isomonodromic deformation equations are derived as
nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems from the classical $R$--matrix Poisson
bracket structure on the dual space $\wt{\frak{sl}}_R^*(2)$ of the loop algebra
$\wt{\frak{sl}}_R(2)$. The Hamiltonians are obtained by composing elements of
the Poisson commuting ring of spectral invariant functions on
$\wt{\frak{sl}}_R^*(2)$ with a time--dependent family of Poisson maps whose
images are $4$--dimensional rational coadjoint orbits in
$\wt{\frak{sl}}_R^*(2)$. Each system may be interpreted as describing a
particle moving on a surface of zero curvature in the presence of a
time--varying electromagnetic field. The Painlev\'e equations follow from
reduction of these systems by the Hamiltonian flow generated by a second
commuting element in the ring of spectral invariants.
