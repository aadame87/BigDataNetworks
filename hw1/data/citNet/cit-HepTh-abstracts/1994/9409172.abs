Title: Non-commutative geometry and covariance: from the quantum plane to the
  quantum tensors
Authors: J.A. de Azcarraga, P.P. Kulish, F. Rodenas
Comments: Lecture delivered (by J.A.) at the 3rd Colloquium `Quantum groups and
  Physics', Prague, June 1994. To appear in the proceedings (Czechoslovak J.
  Phys.)

\\
  Reflection and braid equations for rank two $q$-tensors are derived from the
covariance properties of quantum vectors by using the $R$-matrix formalism.
