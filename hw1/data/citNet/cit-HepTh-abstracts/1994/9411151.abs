  We investigate how exotic differential structures may reveal themselves in
particle physics. The analysis is based on the A. Connes' construction of the
standard model. It is shown that, if one of the copies of the spacetime
manifold is equipped with an exotic differential structure, compact object of
geometric origin may exist even if the spacetime is topologically trivial.
Possible implications are discussed. An $SU(3)\otimes SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ gauge
model is constructed. This model may not be realistic but it shows what kind of
physical phenomena might be expected due to the existence of exotic
differential structures on the spacetime manifold.
