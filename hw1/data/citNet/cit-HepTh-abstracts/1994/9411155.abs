  Spinors for an arbitrary Minkowski space with signature ($t$, $s$) are
reassessed in connection with $D$-dimensional free Dirac action. The
possibility of writing down kinetic and mass terms for charge-conjugated
spinors is discussed in terms of the number of time-like directions of the
space-time.
