\\
  A class of two dimensional field theories, based on (generically degenerate)
Poisson structures and generalizing gravity-Yang-Mills systems, is presented.
Locally, the solutions of the classical equations of motion are given. A
general scheme for the quantization of the models in a Hamiltonian formulation
is found.
