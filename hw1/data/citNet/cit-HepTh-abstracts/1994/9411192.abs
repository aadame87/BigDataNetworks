Title: On relations between vertex operators, quasiclassical operators, and
  phase space coordinates
Author: Robert Carroll (Mathematics Dept., University of Illinois, Urbana)

\\
  For certain situations we give a geometrical background for quasiclassical KP
calculations based on an explicit connection to quantum mechanics and the
collapse of coherent states to coadjoint orbits for classical operators.
