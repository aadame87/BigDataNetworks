  A two-dimensional nonrelativistic fermion system coupled to both
electromagnetic gauge fields and Chern-Simons gauge fields is analysed.
Polarization tensors relevant in the quantum Hall effect and anyon
superconductivity are obtained as simple closed integrals and are evaluated
numerically for all momenta and frequencies. The correction to the energy
density is evaluated in the random phase approximation (RPA), by summing an
infinite series of ring diagrams. It is found that the correction has
significant dependence on the particle number density.
  In the context of anyon superconductivity, the energy density relative to the
mean field value is minimized at a hole concentration per lattice plaquette
(0.05 \sim 0.06) (p_c a/\hbar)^2 where p_c and a are the momentum cutoff and
lattice constant, respectively. At the minimum the correction is about -5 %
\sim -25 %, depending on the ratio (2m \omega_c)/(p_c^2) where \omega_c is the
frequency cutoff.
  In the Jain-Fradkin-Lopez picture of the fractional quantum Hall effect the
RPA correction to the energy density is very large. It diverges logarithmically
as the cutoff is removed, implying that corrections beyond RPA become important
at large momentum and frequency.
