  It has been discussed earlier that ( weak quasi-) quantum groups allow for
conventional interpretation as internal symmetries in local quantum theory.
From general arguments and explicit examples their consistency with (braid-)
statistics and locality was established. This work addresses to the
reconstruction of quantum symmetries and algebras of field operators. For every
algebra $\A$ of observables satisfying certain standard assumptions, an
appropriate quantum symmetry is found. Field operators are obtained which act
on a positive definite Hilbert space of states and transform covariantly under
the quantum symmetry. As a substitute for Bose/Fermi (anti-) commutation
relations, these fields are demonstrated to obey local braid relation.
