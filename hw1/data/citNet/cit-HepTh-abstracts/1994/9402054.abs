  We compute the Poisson bracket relations for the monodromy matrix of the
auxiliary linear problem. If the basic Poisson bracket relations of the model
contain derivatives, this computation leads to a peculiar type of symmetry
breaking which accounts for a 'spontaneous quantization of the underlying
global gauge group. A classification of possible patterns of symmetry breaking
is outlined.
