  In the same spirit as done for N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric non-linear $\si$
models in 2 space-time dimensions by Zumino and Alvarez- Gaum\'e and Freedman,
we analyse the (2,0) and (4,0) heterotic geometry in holomorphic coordinates.
We study the properties of the torsion tensor and give the conditions under
which (2,0) geometry is conformally equivalent to a (2,2) one. Using additional
isometries, we show that it is difficult to equip a manifold with a closed
torsion tensor, but for the real 4 dimensional case where we exhibit new
examples. We show that, contrarily to Callan, Harvey and Strominger 's claim
for real 4 dimensional manifolds, (4,0) heterotic geometry is not necessarily
conformally equivalent to a (4,4) K\"ahler Ricci flat geometry. We rather prove
that, whatever the real dimension be, they are special quasi Ricci flat spaces,
and we exemplify our results on Eguchi-Hanson and Taub-NUT metrics with
torsion.
