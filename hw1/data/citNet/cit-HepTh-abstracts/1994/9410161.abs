Title: Dimensionality as a Perturbation Parameter in the Generalized Hydrogen
  Atom
Authors: C.R. Hagen
Comments: 5 pages, UR1392, ER-40685-841
\\
  A recent suggestion has been made that the hydrogen bound state spectrum
should not depend on the number of spatial dimensions. It is pointed out here
that the uncertainty principle implies that such differences must exist and
that a perturbation expansion in the dimensionality parameter yields a precise
quantitative confirmation of the effect.
