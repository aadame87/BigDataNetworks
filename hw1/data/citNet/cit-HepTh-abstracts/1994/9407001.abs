  For general finite temperature different from the Hawking one there appears a
well known conical singularity in the Euclidean classical solution of
gravitational equations. The method of regularizing the cone by regular surface
is used to determine the curvature tensors for such a metrics. This allows one
to calculate the one-loop matter effective action and the corresponding
one-loop quantum corrections to the entropy in the framework of the path
integral approach of Gibbons and Hawking. The two-dimensional and
four-dimensional cases are considered. The entropy of the Rindler space is
shown to be divergent logarithmically in two dimensions and quadratically in
four dimensions that coincides with results obtained earlier. For the eternal
2D black hole we observe finite, dependent on the mass, correction to the
entropy. The entropy of the 4D Schwarzschild black hole is shown to possess an
additional (in comparison with the 4D Rindler space) logarithmically divergent
correction which does not vanish in the limit of infinite mass of the black
hole. We argue that infinities of the entropy in four dimensions are
renormalized by the renormalization of the gravitational coupling.
