  Their Intersection Parings

\\
  As a generalization of our previous paper [GK], we formulate a residue
formula and some simple behaviors of equivariant quantum cohomology applying to
compute the quantum cohomology of partial flag manifolds $F_{k_1,\cdots , k_l}
$with a try to give a rigorous definition of equivariant quantum cohomology.
