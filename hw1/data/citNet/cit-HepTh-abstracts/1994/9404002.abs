  We consider the Krein realization of the Hilbert space for a massless scalar
field in 1+1 dimensions. We find convergence criteria and the completion of the
space of test functions ${\cal S}$ with the topology induced by the Krein
scalar product. Finally, we show that the interpretation for the Fourier
components as probability amplitudes for the momentum operator is lost in this
case.
