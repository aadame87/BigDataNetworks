  It is shown that the vacuum Einstein equations for an arbitrary stationary
axisymmetric space-time can be completely separated by re-formulating the Ernst
equation and its associated linear system in terms of a non-autonomous
Schlesinger-type dynamical system. The conformal factor of the metric coincides
(up to some explicitly computable factor) with the $\tau$-function of the Ernst
equation in the presence of finitely many regular singularities. We also
present a canonical formulation of these results, which is based on a
``two-time" Hamiltonian approach, and which opens new avenues for the
quantization of such systems.
