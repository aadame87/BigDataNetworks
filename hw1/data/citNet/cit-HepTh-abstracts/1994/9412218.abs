  The operator ordering problem due to the quantization or regularization
ambiguity in the Chern-Simons theory exists. However, we show that this can be
avoided if we require Galilei covariance of the nonrelativistic Abelian
Chern-Simons theory even at the quantum level for the extended sources. The
covariance can be recovered only by choosing some particular operator orderings
for the generators of the Galilei group depending on the quantization
ambiguities of the $gauge-matter$ commutation relation. We show that the
desired ordering for the unusual prescription is not the same as the well-known
normal ordering but still satisfies all the necessary conditions. Furthermore,
we show that the equations of motion can be expressed in a similar form
regardless of the regularization ambiguity. This suggests that the different
regularization prescriptions do not change the physics. On the other hand, for
the case of point sources the regularization prescription is uniquely
determined, and only the orderings, which are equivalent to the usual one, are
allowed.
