  The geodesic motion of pseudo-classical spinning particles in the Euclidean
Taub-NUT space is analysed. The generalized Killing equations for spinning
space are investigated and the constants of motion are derived in terms of the
solutions of these equations. A simple exact solution, corresponding to
trajectories lying on a cone, is given.
