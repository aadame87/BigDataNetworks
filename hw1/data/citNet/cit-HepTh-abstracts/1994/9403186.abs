  Conformal field theories corresponding to two-dimensional electrically
charged black holes and to two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with a
covariantly constant electric field are simply constructed as $SL(2,R)/Z$ WZW
coset models. The two-dimensional electrically charged black holes are related
by Kaluza-Klein reduction to the 2+1-dimensional rotating black hole of
Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli, and our construction is correspondingly
related to its realization as a WZW model. Four-dimensional spacetime solutions
are obtained by tensoring these two-dimensional theories with $SU(2)/Z(m)$
coset models. These describe a family of dyonic black holes and the
Bertotti--Robinson universe.
