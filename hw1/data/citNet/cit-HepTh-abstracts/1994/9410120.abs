  Goldstone Bosons of SL(4)/O(4)

  A model of random triangulations of a domain in $R^{(4)}$ is presented. The
global symmetries of the model include SL(4) transformations and translations.
If a stable microscopic scale exists for some range of parameters, the model
should be in a translation invariant phase where SL(4) is spontaneously broken
to O(4). In that phase, SL(4) Ward identities imply that the correlation length
in the spin two channel of a symmetric tensor field is infinite. Consequently,
it may be possible to identify the continuum limit of four dimensional Quantum
Gravity with points inside that phase.
