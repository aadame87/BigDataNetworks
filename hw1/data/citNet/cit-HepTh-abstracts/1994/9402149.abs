  Rotating stringy black hole solutions with non-vanishing dilaton $\phi$,
antisymmetric tensor $B_{\mu\nu}$, and $U(1)$ gauge field $A_{\mu}$ are
investigated. Both Boyer-Lindquist-like and Kerr-Schild-like coordinate are
constructed. The latter is utilised to construct the analytically extended
spacetime. The global structure of the resulting extended spacetime is almost
identical to that of the Kerr. In carrying out the analytic extension, the
radial coordinate should be suitably chosen so that we can avoid singularity
caused by the twisting. The thermodynamic property of the stringy black hole is
examined through the injection of test bodies into the black hole. It is shown
that one cannot change a black hole configuration into a naked singularity by
way of throwing test bodies into the black hole. The global $O(2,3)$ symmetry
and the preservation of the asymptotic flatness are discussed. When we impose
stationarity, axisymmetry, and asymptotic flatness, there is no other twisting
than the one pointed out by A.Sen\cite{sen}. All the other elements of $O(2,3)$
either break the asymptotic flatness, or cause only coordinate transformations
and gives no physical change.
