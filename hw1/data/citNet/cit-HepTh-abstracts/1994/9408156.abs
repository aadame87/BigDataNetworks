  The valley structure associated with quantum meta-stability is examined. It
is defined by the new valley equation, which enables consistent evaluation of
the imaginary-time path-integral. We study the structure of this new valley
equation and solve these equations numerically. The valley is shown to contain
the bounce solution, as well as other bubble structures. We find that even when
the bubble solution has thick wall, the outer region of the valley is made of
large-radius, thin-wall bubble, which interior is occupied by the true-vacuum.
Smaller size bubbles, which contribute to decay at higher energies, are also
identified.
