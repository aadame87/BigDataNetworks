  A new pseudoclassical model to describe Weyl particles is proposed. Different
ways of its quantization are presented. They all lead to the theory of Weyl
particle; namely, the massless Dirac equation and the Weyl condition are
reproduced. In contrast with models discussed previously, this one admits both
the Dirac quantization and quasicanonical quantization, with the fixation of
almost all gauge freedom on the classical level.
