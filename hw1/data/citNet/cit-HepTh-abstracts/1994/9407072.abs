  The nonlinear $\sigma$-model is considered to be useful in describing hadrons
(Skyrmions) in low energy hadron physics and the approximate behavior of the
global texture. Here we investigate the properties of the static solution of
the nonlinear $\sigma$-model equation coupled with gravity. As in the case
where gravity is ignored, there is still no scale parameter that determines the
size of the static solution and the winding number of the solution is $1/2$.
The geometry of the spatial hyperspace in the asymptotic region of large $r$ is
explicitly shown to be that of a flat space with some missing solid angle.
