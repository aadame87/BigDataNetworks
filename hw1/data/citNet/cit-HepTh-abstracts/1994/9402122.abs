  equivalence of vector and axial gauging has been corrected.)

  We study the $N = 2$ coset models in their formulation as supersymmetric
gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models. A model based on the coset $G/H$ is invariant
under a symmetry group isomorphic to $\Z_{k+Q}$, where $k$ is the level of the
model and $Q$ is the dual Coxeter number of $G$. Using a duality-like
relationship, we show that the $\Z_m$ orbifold of the vectorially gauged model
and the $\Z_{\tilde{m}}$ orbifold of the axially gauged model are each others
mirror partners when $m \tilde{m} = k + Q$.
