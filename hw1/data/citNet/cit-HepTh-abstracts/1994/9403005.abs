Title: Symmetries of the Kadomstev-Petviashvili Hierarchy
Authors: A. Yu. Orlov and P. Winternitz
Comments: 4 pages, CRM-2149
\\
  The relation between the $\widehat{\Sl}(\infty)$ algebra of flows commuting
with the KP hierarchy and the Kac-Moody-Virasoro Lie point symmetries of
individual equations is established. This is used to calculate the point
symmetries for all equations in the hierarchy.
