  Target space symmetries are studied for orbifold compactified string theories
containing Wilson line background fields. The symmetries determined are for
those moduli which contribute to the string loop threshold corrections of the
gauge coupling constants. The groups found are subgroups of the modular group
$PSL(2, Z)$ and depend on the choice of discrete Wilson lines and the shape of
the underlying six-dimensional lattice.
