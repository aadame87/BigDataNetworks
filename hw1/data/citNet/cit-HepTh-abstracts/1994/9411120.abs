  We represent the two - dimensional planar classical continuous Heisenberg
spin model as a constrained Chern-Simons gauged nonlinear Schr\"odinger system.
The hamiltonian structure of the model is studied, allowing the quantization of
the theory by the gauge invariant approach. A preliminary study of the quantum
states is displayed and several physical consequences in terms of anyons are
discussed.
