  Higher spin extensions of nonabelian gauge symmetries for both free fermionic
model and WZNW model are considered on a classical level. It is characteristic
property of the WZNW model that the higher spin currents which correspond to
linear realized higher spin extended affine algebra do not form an invariant
space. An extended invariant current space is obtained which allows us to gauge
the symmetry.
