Title: Models on Event Symmetric Space-Time

  In the event symmetric approach to quantum gravity it is assumed that the
fundamental laws of physics must be invariant under exchange of any two
space-time events. The fact that this symmetry if obviously not observed is
attributed to the possibility of a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism in
which the residual symmetry is diffeomorphism invariance on a continuum. The
approach has a discrete nature while dimensionality, continuity of space-time
and causality are abandoned as fundamental principles. Consequently space-time
is a dynamical object which may undergo changes of topology or dimension. A
number of different types of Event Symmetric model are described. The most
interesting models are event symmetric superstring models based on discrete
string supergroups.
