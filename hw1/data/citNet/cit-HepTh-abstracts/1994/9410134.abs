  It is shown that the Topological Massive and ``Self-dual'' theories, which
are known to provide locally equivalent descriptions of spin 1 theories in 2+1
dimensions, have different global properties when formulated over topologically
non-trivial regions of space-time. The partition function of these theories,
when constructed on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, differ by a topological
factor, which is equal to the partition function of the pure Chern-Simons
theory. This factor is related to the space of solutions of the field equations
of the Topological Massive Theory for which the connection is asymptotically
flat but not gauge equivalent to zero. A new covariant, first order, gauge
action,which generalize the ``Self-dual'' action, is then proposed. It is
obtained by sewing local self-dual theories. Its global equivalence to the
Topological Massive gauge theory is shown.
