  We introduce a new construction of bilinear invariant forms on Lie algebras,
based on the method of graded contractions. The general method is described and
the $\Bbb Z_2$-, $\Bbb Z_3$-, and $\Bbb Z_2\otimes\Bbb Z_2$-contractions are
found. The results can be applied to all Lie algebras and superalgebras (finite
or infinite dimensional) which admit the chosen gradings. We consider some
examples: contractions of the Killing form, toroidal contractions of $su(3)$,
and we briefly discuss the limit to new WZW actions.
