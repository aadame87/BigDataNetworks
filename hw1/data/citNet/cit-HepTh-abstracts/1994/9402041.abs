  In this article we review the Duistermaat-Heckman integration formula and the
ensuing equivariant cohomology structure, in the finite dimensional case. In
particular, we discuss the connection between equivariant cohomology and
classical integrability. We also explain how the integration formula is
derived, and explore some possible new directions that could eventually yield
novel integration formulas for nontrivial integrable models.
