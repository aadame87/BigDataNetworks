Title: Stochastic Master Fields
Authors: Michael R. Douglas
Comments: In this version we added comments on the relation to earlier work of
  Haan and of Cvitanovic, Lauwers and Scharbach. (We also made minor
  improvements to the body of the paper.) (20pp. harvmac, 1 figure)

  We treat the stochastic equation for large N master fields proposed by
Greensite and Halpern using a construction of master fields modelled after work
of Voiculescu, and show that it contains the same information as the usual
factorized Schwinger-Dyson equations.
