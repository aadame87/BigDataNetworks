  We examine the behavior of the non-linear interactions between
electromagnetic fields at high temperature. It is shown that, in general, the
log(T) dependence on the temperature of the Green functions is simply related
to their UV behavior at zero-temperature. We argue that the effective action
describing the nonlinear thermal electromagnetic interactions has a finite
limit as T tends to infinity. This thermal action approaches, in the long
wavelength limit, the negative of the corresponding zero-temperature action.
