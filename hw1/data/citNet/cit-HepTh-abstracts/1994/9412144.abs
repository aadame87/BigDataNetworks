  Thermodynamics of scalar fields is investigated in three dimensional black
hole backgrounds in two approaches. One is mode expansion and direct
computation of the partition sum, and the other is the Euclidean path integral
approach. We obtain a number of exact results, for example, mode functions,
Hartle-Hawking Green functions on the black holes, Green functions on a cone
geometry, free energies and entropies. They constitute reliable bases for the
thermodynamics of scalar fields. It is shown that thermodynamic quantities
largely depend upon the approach to calculate them, boundary conditions for the
scalar fields and regularization method. We find that, in general, the
entropies are not proportional to the area of the horizon and that their
divergent parts are not necessarily due to the existence of the horizon.
