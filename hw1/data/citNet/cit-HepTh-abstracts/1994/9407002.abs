  A complete RST quantization of a CGHS model plus Strominger term is carried
out. In so doing a conformal invariant theory with $\kappa=\frac{N}{12}$ is
found, that is, without ghosts contribution. The physical consequences of the
model are analysed and positive definite Hawking radiation is found.
