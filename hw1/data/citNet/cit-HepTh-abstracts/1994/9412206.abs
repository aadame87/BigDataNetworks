  We twist the monopole equations of Seiberg and Witten and show how these
equations are realized in topological Yang-Mills theory. A Floer derivative and
a Morse functional are found and are used to construct a unitary transformation
between the usual Floer cohomologies and those of the monopole equations.
Furthermore, these equations are seen to reside in the vanishing self-dual
curvature condition of an $OSp(1|2)$-bundle. Alternatively, they may be seen
arising directly from a vanishing self-dual curvature condition on an
$SU(2)$-bundle in which the fermions are realized as spanning the tangent space
for a specific background.
