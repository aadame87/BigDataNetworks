Title: No $Z_N$ - bubbles in hot Yang-Mills theory
Authors: A.V.Smilga
Comments: An invited talk presented on the ICHEP-94 conference. LaTeX, 9 pages
\\
  Pure Yang-Mills theory at high temperature is considered. We show that no
distinct $Z_N$- phases separated by domain walls do exist in the physical
Minkowski space. That means the absense of the spontaneous breaking of $Z_N$-
symmetry in the physical meaning of this word.
