  Fock Transformations
Authors: M. Kibler and P. Labastie

\\
  Preliminary results concerning non-quadratic (and non-bijective)
transformations that exibit a degree of parentage with the well known
Levi-Civita, Kustaanheimo-Stiefel, and Fock transformations are reported in
this article. Some of the new transformations are applied to non-relativistic
quantum dynamical systems in two dimensions.
