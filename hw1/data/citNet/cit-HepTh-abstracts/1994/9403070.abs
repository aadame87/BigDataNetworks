  The renormalisation group equation for $N$-point correlation functions can be
interpreted in a geometrical manner as an equation for Lie transport of
amplitudes in the space of couplings. The vector field generating the
diffeomorphism has components given by the $\beta$-functions of the theory. It
is argued that this simple picture requires modification whenever any one of
the points at which the amplitude is evaluated becomes close to any other. This
modification requires the introduction of a connection on the space of
couplings and new terms appear in the renormalisation group equation involving
co-variant derivatives of the $\beta$-function and the curvature associated
with the connection. It is shown how the connection is related to the operator
expansion co-efficients, but there remains an arbitrariness in its definition.
