  We introduce a generalization of $A_{r}$-type Toda theory based on a
non-abelian group G, which we call the $(A_{r},G)$-Toda theory, and its affine
extensions in terms of gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten actions with deformation
terms. In particular, the affine $(A_{1},SU(2))$-Toda theory describes the
integrable deformation of the minimal conformal theory for the critical Ising
model by the operator $\Phi_{(2,1)}$. We derive infinite conserved charges and
soliton solutions from the Lax pair of the affine $(A_{1}, SU(2))$-Toda theory.
Another type of integrable deformation which accounts for the
$\Phi_{(3,1)}$-deformation of the minimal model is also found in the gauged
Wess-Zumino-Witten context and its infinite conserved charges are given.
