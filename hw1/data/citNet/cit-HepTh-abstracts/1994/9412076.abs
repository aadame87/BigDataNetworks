  The properties of static spherically symmetric black holes, which are either
electrically or magnetically charged, and which are coupled to the dilaton in
the presence of a cosmological constant, are considered. It is shown that such
solutions do not exist if the cosmological constant is positive (in arbitrary
spacetime dimension >= 4). However, asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole
solutions with a single horizon do exist if the cosmological constant is
negative. These solutions are studied numerically in four dimensions and the
thermodynamic properties of the solutions are derived. The extreme solutions
are found to have zero entropy and infinite temperature for all non-zero values
of the dilaton coupling constant.
