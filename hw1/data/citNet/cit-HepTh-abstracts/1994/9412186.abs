   Instanton effects in a family of completely massive Higgs models with N=1
supersymmetry are investigated. The models have $N_c=2$ and $N_f\ge 2$. In each
model, we show that a certain gauge invariant correlation function depends in a
non-trivial way on its coordinates, in spite of the fact that supersymmetry
requires its constancy. This means that non-perturbative effects break
supersymmetry explicitly in the one instanton sector. We also show that
condensates arising in the point-like limit of the above correlation functions
can in principle be used to induce the Electro-Weak scale.
