Title: A lecture on the Calogero-Sutherland models
Authors: V. Pasquier
Comments: (2 references added, small modifications)
\\
  In these lectures, I review some recent results on the Calogero-Sutherland
model and the Haldane Shastry-chain. The list of topics I cover are the
following: 1) The Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian and fractional statistics.
The form factor of the density operator. 2) The Dunkl operators and their
relations with monodromy matrices, Yangians and affine-Hecke algebras. 3) The
Haldane-Shastry chain in connection with the Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian at
a specific coupling constant.
