  We give a non-static exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations (with
null fluid), which is a non-static magnetic charge generalization to the
Bonnor-Vaidya solution and describes the gravitational and electromagnetic
fields of a nonrotating massive radiating dyon. In addition, using the
energy-momentum pseudotensors of Einstein and Landau and Lifshitz we obtain the
energy, momentum, and power output of the radiating dyon and find that both
prescriptions give the same result.
