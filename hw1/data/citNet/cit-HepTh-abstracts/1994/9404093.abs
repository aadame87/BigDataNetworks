  The commutator anomalies (Schwinger terms) of current algebras in $3+1$
dimensions are computed in terms of the Wodzicki residue of pseudodifferential
operators; the result can be written as a (twisted) Radul 2-cocycle for the Lie
algebra of PSDO's. The construction of the (second quantized) current algebra
is closely related to a geometric renormalization of the interaction
Hamiltonian $H_I=j_{\mu} A^{\mu}$ in gauge theory.
