  Dominant weight multiplicities of simple Lie groups are expressed in terms of
the modular matrices of Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, and
related objects. Symmetries of the modular matrices give rise to new relations
among multiplicities. At least for some Lie groups, these new relations are
strong enough to completely fix all multiplicities.
