  A pedagogical discussion is given of some aspects of \lq\lq quantum black
holes", primarily using recently developed two-dimensional models. After a
short preliminary concerning classical black holes, we give several motivations
for studying such models, especially the so called dilaton gravity models in
$1+1$ dimensions. Particularly attractive is the one proposed by
Callan,Giddings, Harvey and Strominger (CGHS), which is classically solvable
and contains black hole solutions. Its semi-classical as well as classical
properties will be reviewed, including how a flux of matter fields produces a
black hole with a subsequent emission of Hawking radiation. Breakdown of such
an approximation near the horizon, however, calls for exactly solvable variants
of this model and some attempts in this direction will then be described. A
focus will be placed on a model with 24 matter fields, for which exact
quantization can be performed and physical states constructed. A method will
then be proposed to extract space-time geometry described by these states in
the sense of quantum average and examples containing a black hole will be
presented. Finally we give a (partial) list of future problems and discuss the
nature of difficulties in resolving them.
