  The divergences that arise in the regularized partition function for closed
bosonic string theory in flat space lead to three types of perturbation series
expansions, distinguished by their genus dependence. This classification of
infinities can be traced to geometrical characteristics of the string
worldsheet. Some categories of divergences may be eliminated in string theories
formulated on compact manifolds.
