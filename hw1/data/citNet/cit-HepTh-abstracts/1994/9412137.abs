  The relationship between the Dirac and reduced phase space quantizations is
investigated for spin models belonging to the class of Hamiltonian systems
having no gauge conditions. It is traced out that the two quantization methods
may give similar, or essentially different physical results, and, moreover, it
is shown that there is a class of constrained systems, which can be quantized
only by the Dirac method. A possible interpretation of the gauge degrees of
freedom is given.
