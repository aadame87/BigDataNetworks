  We discuss the properties and interpretation of a discrete sequence of a
static spherically symmetric solutions of the Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. This
sequence is parametrized by the number $n$ of zeros of a component of the gauge
field potential. It is demonstrated that solutions with odd $n$ posses all the
properties of the sphaleron. It is shown that there are normalizable fermion
zero modes in the background of these solutions. The question of instability is
critically analysed.
