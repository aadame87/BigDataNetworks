  The chiral null model is a generalization of the fundamental string and
gravitational wave background. It is an example of a conformally invariant
model in all orders in $\alpha'$ and has unbroken supersymmetries. In a
Kaluza--Klein approach we start in 10 dimensions and reduce the model down to 4
dimensions without making any restrictions. The 4-D field content is given by
the metric, torsion, dilaton, a moduli field and 6 gauge fields. This model is
self-dual and near the singularities asymptotically free. The relation to known
IWP, Taub-NUT and rotating black hole solutions is discussed.
