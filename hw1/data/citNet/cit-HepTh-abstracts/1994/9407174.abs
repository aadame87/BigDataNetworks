  It is shown that every Feynman integral can be interpreted as Green function
of some linear differential operator with constant coefficients. This
definition is equivalent to usual one but needs no regularization and
application of $R$-operation. It is argued that presented formalism is
convenient for practical calculations of Feynman integrals.
