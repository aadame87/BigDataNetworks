  We construct the U(N) spinning particle theories, which describe particles
moving on Kahler spaces. These particles have the same relation to the N=2
string as usual spinning particles have to the NSR string. We find the
restrictions on the target space of the theories coming from supersymmetry and
from global anomalies. Finally, we show that the partition functions of the
theories agree with what is expected from their spectra, unlike that of the N=2
string in which there is an anomalous dependence on the proper time.
