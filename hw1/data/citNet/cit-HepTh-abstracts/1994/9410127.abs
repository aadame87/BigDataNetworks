Title: Supersymmetry and Solitons: N=2 and N=0
Authors: Zvonimir Hlousek and Donald Spector
Comments: 5 pages, phyzzx, HWS-94/16
\\
  This talk summarizes our recent work establishing an algebraic,
model-independent basis for the existence of \B bounds and \B equations for
topologically non-trivial solitons and instantons. Our arguments use
supersymmetry in an essential way to understand both supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric theories. Our arguments are constructive and work in nearly
any number of dimensions. Presented at and to appear in the proceedings of the
XX^{th} International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics,
Osaka, July 1994.
