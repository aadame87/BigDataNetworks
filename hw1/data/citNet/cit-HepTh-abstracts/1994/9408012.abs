Title: On Entropy of 3-Dimensional Simplicial Complexes
Authors: D.V.Boulatov
Comments: NBI-HE-94-37, 13 pages
\\
  We prove that the number of 3-dimensional simplicial complexes having the
spherical topology grows exponentially as a function of a volume. It is
suggested that the 3d simplicial quantum gravity has qualitatively the same
phase structure as the O(n) matrix model in the dense phase.
