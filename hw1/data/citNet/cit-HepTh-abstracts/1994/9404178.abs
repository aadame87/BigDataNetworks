Title: Implications of an Ambiguity in J.S. Bell's Analysis of the
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Problem

  An ambiguity is pointed out in J.S. Bell's argument that the distinction
between quantum mechanics and hidden variable theories cannot be found in the
behavior of single-particle beams. Within the context of theories for which
states are unambiguously defined it is shown that the question of whether
quantum mechanics or a locally realistic theory is valid may indeed be answered
by single-particle beam measurements. It is argued that two-particle
correlation experiments are required to answer the more fundamental question of
whether or not the notion of a state can be unambiguously defined. As a
byproduct of the discussion the general form of completely entangled states is
deduced.
