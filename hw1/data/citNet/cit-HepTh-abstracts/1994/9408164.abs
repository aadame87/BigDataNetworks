  It is possible to define new, gauge invariant variables in the Hilbert space
of Yang-Mills theories which manifestly implement Gauss' law on physical
states. These variables have furthermore a geometrical meaning, and allow one
to uncover further constraints physical states must satisfy. For gauge group
$SU(2)$, the underlying geometry is Riemannian and based on the group $GL(3)$.
The formalism allows also for the inclusion of static color sources and the
extension to gauge groups $SU(N>2)$, both of which are discussed here.
