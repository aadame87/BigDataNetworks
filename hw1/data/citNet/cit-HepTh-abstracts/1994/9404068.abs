  The general expression for the bicovariant bracket for odd generators of the
external algebra on a Poisson-Lie group is given. It is shown that the graded
Poisson-Lie structures derived before for $GL(N)$ and $SL(N)$ are the special
cases of this bracket. The formula is the universal one and can be applied to
the case of any matrix Lie group.
