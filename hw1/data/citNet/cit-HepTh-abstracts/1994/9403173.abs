  Applying the techniques of nonabelian duality to a system of Majorana
fermions in 1+1 dimensions we obtain the level-one Wess-Zumino-Witten model as
the dual theory. This makes nonabelian bosonization a particular case of a
nonabelian duality transformation, generalizing our previous result
(hep-th/9401105) for the abelian case.
