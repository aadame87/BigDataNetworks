  The theory of representations of Clifford algebras is extended to employ the
division algebra of the octonions or Cayley numbers. In particular, questions
that arise from the non-associativity and non-commutativity of this division
algebra are answered. Octonionic representations for Clifford algebras lead to
a notion of octonionic spinors and are used to give octonionic representations
of the respective orthogonal groups. Finally, the triality automorphisms are
shown to exhibit a manifest $\perm_3 \times SO(8)$ structure in this framework.
