  The antibracket formalism for gauge theories, at both the classical and
quantum level, is reviewed. Gauge transformations and the associated gauge
structure are analyzed in detail. The basic concepts involved in the
antibracket formalism are elucidated. Gauge-fixing, quantum effects, and
anomalies within the field-antifield formalism are developed. The concepts,
issues and constructions are illustrated using eight gauge-theory models.
