  Gauge fixing and the observable fields for both abelian and non-abelian gauge
theories with spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry are studied. We explicitly
show that it is possible to globally fix the gauge in the broken sector and
hence construct physical fields even in the non-abelian theory. We predict that
any high temperature restoration of gauge symmetry will be accompanied by a
confining transition.
