\\
  The scattering process of two particles at Planck energies or beyond is
calculated using the gravitational shock wave metric for a massive black hole.
Then, the scattering between a heavy mass particle and a small mass one is deal
with. The cross section contains an extra new term of $\sigma \propto G^3$ as
the correction term of the leading term derived by 't Hooft. The
ultrarelativistic limit of the Lorentz boosted Reissner--Norstrom black hole is
also calculated.
