  Path integral formulations for the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials in two-
and three-dimen\-sional Euclidean space are presented. We mention all
coordinate systems which separate the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials and
state the corresponding path integral formulations. Whereas in many coordinate
systems an explicit path integral formulation is not possible, we list in all
soluble cases the path integral evaluations explicitly in terms of the
propagators and the spectral expansions into the wave-functions.
