  It is shown that the Coulomb correlation problem for a system of two
electrons (two charged particles) in an external oscillator potential possesses
a hidden $sl_2$-algebraic structure being one of recently-discovered
quasi-exactly-solvable problems. The origin of existing exact solutions to this
problem, recently discovered by several authors, is explained. A degeneracy of
energies in electron-electron and electron-positron correlation problems is
found. It manifests the first appearence of hidden $sl_2$-algebraic structure
in atomic physics.
