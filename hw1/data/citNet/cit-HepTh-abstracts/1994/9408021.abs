Title: On Quantum Jumps, Events and Spontaneous Localization Models
Author: A. Jadczyk
Comments: 20 pages
\\
  We propose a definite meaning to the concepts of "experiment",
"measurement" and "event" in the event-enhanced formalism of quantum
theory. A minimal piecewise deterministic process is given that can be
used for a computer simulation of real time series of experiments on
single quantum objects. As an example a generalized cloud chamber is
described, including multiparticle case. Relation to the GRW
spontaneous localization model is discussed. The second revised version
of the paper contains references to papers by other authors that
are are aiming in the same direction: to enhance quantum theory
in such a way that it will provide stochastic description of
events triggered by individual quantum systems.
