  In this paper we calculate the particle creation as seen by a stationary
observer in an anisotropic universe. By using an observer and geometry
dependent time to quantise a massive scalar field we show that a discrete
energy spectrum shift occurs. The length scale associated with the geometry
provides the energy scale by which the spectrum is shifted. The $\beta(p,q)$
coefficient for the Bogolubov transformation calculated is proportional to a
series of delta functions whose argument contains $p$ and $q$ and half
multiples of the root of the curvature.
