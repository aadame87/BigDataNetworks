  The high-temperature expansion for closed superstring one-loop free energy is
studied. The Laurent series representation is obtained and its sum is
analytically continued in order to investigate the nature of the critical
(Hagedorn) temperature. It is found that beyond this critical temperature the
statistical sum contribution of the free energy is finite but has an imaginary
part, signalling a possible metastability of the system.
