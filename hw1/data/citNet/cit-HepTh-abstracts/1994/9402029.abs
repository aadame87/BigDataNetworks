  A light-like Wilson loop is computed in perturbation theory up to ${\cal O}
(g^4)$ for pure Yang--Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions, using Feynman and
light--cone gauges to check its gauge invariance. After dimensional
regularization in intermediate steps, a finite gauge invariant result is
obtained, which however does not exhibit abelian exponentiation. Our result is
at variance with the common belief that pure Yang--Mills theory is free in 1+1
dimensions, apart perhaps from topological effects.
