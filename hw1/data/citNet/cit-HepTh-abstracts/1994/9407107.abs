  Motivated by topological bidimensional quantum models for distinguishable
particles, and by Haldane's definition of mutual statistics for different
species of particles, we propose a new class of one-dimensional $1/r_{ij}^2$
Calogero model with coupling constants $g_{ij}$ depending on the labels of the
particles. We solve the groundstate problem, and show how to build some classes
of excited states.
