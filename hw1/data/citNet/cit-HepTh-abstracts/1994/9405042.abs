  It is shown that elementary indistinguishability properties of partially
polarized mixtures are consistent only with the conventional Hilbert space
model of quantum mechanics and a few exotic alternatives. This applies even in
low dimensions where quantum logic and Gleason's theorem give either weak or no
constraints. Experimental methods for eliminating the exotic cases (which
include quaternionic and octonionic variants of quantum mechanics) are
described.
