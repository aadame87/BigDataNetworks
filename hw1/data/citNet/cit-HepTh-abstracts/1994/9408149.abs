  It is shown that the one-loop quadratic divergences of standard supergravity
can be regulated by the introduction of heavy Pauli-Villars fields belonging to
chiral and abelian gauge multiplets. The resulting one-loop correction can be
interpreted as a renormalization of the K\"ahler potential. Regularization of
the dilaton couplings to the Yang-Mills sector requires special care, and may
shed some light on chiral/linear multiplet duality of the dilaton
supermultiplet.
