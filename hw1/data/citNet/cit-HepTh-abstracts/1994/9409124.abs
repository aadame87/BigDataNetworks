  We present the new explicit geometrical knowledge of the Landau-Ginzburg
orbifolds, when a typical type of superpotential is considered. Relying on
toric geometry, we show the one-to-one correspondence between some of the
$(a,c)$ states with $U(1)$ charges $(-1,1)$ and the $(1,1)$ forms coming from
blowing-up processes. Consequently, we find the monomial-divisor mirror map for
Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds. The possibility of the application of the models of
other types is briefly discussed.
