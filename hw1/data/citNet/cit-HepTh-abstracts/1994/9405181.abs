  The minimal (reduced) and extended canonical formulations for
(2+1)-dimensional fractional spin particles are considered. We investigate the
relationship between them, clearing up the meaning of the coordinates for such
particles, and analyse the related question of correlation between spin and
momentum. The classical lagrangian corresponding to the extended canonical
formulation is constructed, and its gauge symmetries are identified.
