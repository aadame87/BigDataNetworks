  We construct a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra on moduli spaces of Riemann
surfaces. This algebra is background independent in that it makes no reference
to a state space of a conformal field theory. Conformal theories define a
homomorphism of this algebra to the BV algebra of string functionals. The
construction begins with a graded-commutative free associative algebra $\C$
built from the vector space whose elements are orientable subspaces of moduli
spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces. The typical element here is a surface
with several connected components. The operation $\Delta$ of sewing two
punctures with a full twist is shown to be an odd, second order derivation that
squares to zero. It follows that $(\C, \Delta)$ is a Batalin-Vilkovisky
algebra. We introduce the odd operator $\delta = \partial + \hbar\Delta$, where
$\partial$ is the boundary operator. It is seen that $\delta^2=0$, and that
consistent closed string vertices define a cohomology class of $\delta$. This
cohomology class is used to construct a Lie algebra on a quotient space of
$\C$. This Lie algebra gives a manifestly background independent description of
a subalgebra of the closed string gauge algebra.
