Title: Minimal Affinizations of Representations of Quantum Groups: the rank 2
  case
Authors: V. Chari
Comments: 19pages

  We define the notion of a minimal affinization of an irreducible
representation of $U_q(g)$. We prove that minimal affinizations exist and
establish their uniqueness in the rank 2 case.
