  Using a simple model, a new sphaleron solution which incorporates finite
fermionic density effects is obtained. The main result is that the height of
the potential barrier (sphaleron energy) decreases as the fermion density
increases. This suggests that the rate of sphaleron-induced transitions
increases when the fermionic density increases. However the rate increase is
not expected to change significantly the predictions from the standard
sphaleron-induced baryogenesis scenarios.
