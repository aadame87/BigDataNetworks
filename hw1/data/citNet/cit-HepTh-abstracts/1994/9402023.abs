  A canonical basis of global Dirac's observables for Yang-Mills theory with
fermions are obtained in a functional space in which Gribov ambiguity is absent
and Gauss' laws can be solved exactly. In terms of these observables, one can
express the Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian, non-Abelian and topological charges.
The problem of the covariantization of these non-local and non-polynomial
quantities is solved. From a relativistic presymplectic approach to the
localization of the relativistic center-of-mass of the field configuration, a
ultraviolet cutoff is deduced.
