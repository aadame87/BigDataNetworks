  Recently two groups have listed all sets of weights (k_1,...,k_5) such that
the weighted projective space P_4^{(k_1,...,k_5)} admits a transverse
Calabi-Yau hypersurface. It was noticed that the corresponding Calabi-Yau
manifolds do not form a mirror symmetric set since some 850 of the 7555
manifolds have Hodge numbers (b_{11},b_{21}) whose mirrors do not occur in the
list. By means of Batyrev's construction we have checked that each of the 7555
manifolds does indeed have a mirror. The `missing mirrors' are constructed as
hypersurfaces in toric varieties. We show that many of these manifolds may be
interpreted as non-transverse hypersurfaces in weighted P_4's, ie,
hypersurfaces for which dp vanishes at a point other than the origin. This
falls outside the usual range of Landau--Ginzburg theory. Nevertheless
Batyrev's procedure provides a way of making sense of these theories.
