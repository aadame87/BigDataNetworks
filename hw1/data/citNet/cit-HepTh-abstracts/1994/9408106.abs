Author: Yuri Bespalov
Comments: 24 pages, 12 figures

\\
  This is the second part of the paper. Results of the first part about crossed
modules are applied here to study of quantum groups in braided categories.
Correct cross product in the class of quantum braided groups is built.
Criterion when quantum braided group is cross product is otained.
