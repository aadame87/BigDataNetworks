  The paper contains a short review of the theory of symplectic and contact
manifolds and of the generalization of this theory to the case of
supermanifolds. It is shown that this generalization can be used to obtain some
important results in quantum field theory. In particular, regarding
$N$-superconformal geometry as particular case of contact complex geometry, one
can better understand $N=2$ superconformal field theory and its connection to
topological conformal field theory. The odd symplectic geometry constitutes a
mathematical basis of Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure of quantization of gauge
theories.
  The exposition is based mostly on published papers. However, the paper
contains also a review of some unpublished results (in the section devoted to
the axiomatics of $N=2$ superconformal theory and topological quantum field
theory). The paper will be published in Berezin memorial volume.
