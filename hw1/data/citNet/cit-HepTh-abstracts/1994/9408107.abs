  A computer program has been developed which generates Feynman graphs
automatically for scattering and decay processes in non-Abelian gauge theory of
high-energy physics. A new acceleration method is presented for both generating
and eliminating graphs. This method has been shown to work quite efficiently
for any order of coupling constants in any kind of theoretical model. A utility
program is also available for drawing generated graphs. These programs consist
of the most basic parts of the GRACE system, which is now used to automatically
calculate tree and one-loop processes.
