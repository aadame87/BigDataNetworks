  In this paper a fundamental length is introduced into physics. This is done
in a way which respects special relativity and quantum field theory. The theory
has formal similarity to quantum field theory though its properties are far
better: divergences are got rid of. The problem of quantizing gravity is
straightforward in the approach.
