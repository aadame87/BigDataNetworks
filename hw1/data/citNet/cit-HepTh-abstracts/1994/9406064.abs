  We apply Kac's theory of elements of finite order (EFO) in
  Lie groups to the description of discrete gauge symmetries in various
supersymmetric grand unified models. Taking into account the discrete anomaly
cancellation conditions, we identify the EFO which generate certain matter
parities in the context of the supersymmetric $SO(10)$ and $E_6$ models.
