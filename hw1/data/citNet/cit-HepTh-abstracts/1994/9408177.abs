  The Reshetikhin - Turaeve approach to topological invariants of three -
manifolds is generalized to quantum supergroups. A general method for
constructing three - manifold invariants is developed, which requires only the
study of the eigenvalues of certain central elements of the quantum supergroup
in irreducible representations. To illustrate how the method works,
$U_q(gl(2|1))$ at odd roots of unity is studied in detail, and the
corresponding topological invariants are obtained.
