  We prove that each action of a compact matrix quantum group on a compact
quantum space can be decomposed into irreducible representations of the group.
We give the formula for the corresponding multiplicities in the case of the
quotient quantum spaces. We describe the subgroups and the quotient spaces of
quantum SU(2) and SO(3) groups.
