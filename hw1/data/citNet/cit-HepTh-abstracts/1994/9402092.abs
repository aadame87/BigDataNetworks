  Two-dimensional SU($N$) gauge theory is accurately analyzed with the
light-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation, both numerically and analytically. The
light-front Einstein-Schr\"odinger equation for mesonic mass reduces to the 't
Hooft equation in the large $N$ limit, $g^2N$ fixed, where $g$ is the coupling
constant. Hadronic masses are numerically obtained in the region of $m^2 \ll
g^2N$, where $m$ is the bare quark (q) mass. The lightest mesonic and baryonic
states are almost in valence. The second lightest mesonic state is highly
relativistic in the sense that it has a large 4-body ($ {\rm qq} \bar{\rm q}
\bar{\rm q} $) component in addition to the valence (${\rm q} \bar{\rm q}$)
one. In the strong coupling limit our results are consistent with the
prediction of the bosonization for ratios of the lightest and second lightest
mesonic masses to the lightest baryonic one. Analytic solutions to the lightest
hadronic masses are obtained, with a reasonable approximation, as
$\sqrt{2Cm}(1-1/N^2)^{1/4}$ in the mesonic case and
$\sqrt{CmN(N-1)}(1-1/N^2)^{1/4}$ in the baryonic case, where
$C=(g^2N\pi/6)^{1/2}$. The solutions well reproduce the numerical ones. The
$N$- and $m$-dependences of the hadronic masses are explicitly shown by the
analytical solutions.
