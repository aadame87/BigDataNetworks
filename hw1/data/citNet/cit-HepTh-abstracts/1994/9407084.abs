Report-no: LYCEN 9358
\\
  Some ideas about phenomenological applications of quantum algebras to physics
are reviewed. We examine in particular some applications of the algebras $U_ q
(su_2)$ and $U_{qp}({\rm u}_2)$ to various dynamical systems and to atomic and
nuclear spectroscopy. The lack of a true (unique) $q$- or $qp$-quantization
process is emphasized.
