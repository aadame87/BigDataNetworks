  Possible experimental manifestations of the contribution of heavy
Kaluza-Klein particles, within a simple scalar model in six dimensions with
spherical compactification, are studied. The approach is based on the
assumption that the inverse radius $L^{-1}$ of the space of extra dimensions is
of the order of the scale of the supersymmetry breaking $M_{SUSY} \sim 1 \div
10$ TeV. The total cross section of the scattering of two light particles is
calculated to one loop order and the effect of the Kaluza-Klein tower is shown
to be noticeable for energies $\sqrt{s} \geq 1.4 L^{-1}$.
