  TGD suggests the existence of two new branches of physics, namely M_{89}
hadron physics and M_{127} leptohadron physics. Leptons and U type quarks are
predicted to have light colored excitations. The anomalous production of e^+e^-
pairs in heavy ion collisions sup- ports the existence of light leptomeson but
there are objections against light exotics. a) Asymptotic freedom in the
standard sense might be lost: the recently identified exotic color bosons
however save the situation. b) Z^0 decay width seems to exclude light exotics.
The solution of the problem relies on p-adic probability concept. The real
counterpart (\sum_jP(ito j))_R for the sum of p-adic probabi- lities differs
from the sum \sum_j P(i toj)_R for the real counter- parts of p-adic
probabilities. Interpretation:(\sum_jP(i to j))_R is used, when only a common
signature for final states is used. \sum_j(P(i to j)_R is used, when each final
state is monitored separately. The total decay rate of $Z^0$ to unmonitored
exotic leptons is sensitive to the value of \theta_W(eff) and vanishes for
sin^2(\theta_W(eff))=0.2324 and sensible value of \alpha_s(L)! In TGD the
observed top quark candidate most probably corresponds to u and d quarks of
M_{89} hadron physics. The details of the identification and signatures of the
new Physics are discussed.
