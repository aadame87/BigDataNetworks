Title: Asymptotic Solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equation and Crystal
  Base
Authors: A.Varchenko
Comments: 43 pages, amstex
\\
  The Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation associated with $s\ell_2$ is considered.
The transition functions between asymptotic solutions to the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation are described. A connection between asymptotic
solutions and the crystal base in the tensor product of modules over the
quantum group $U_qs\ell_2$ is established, in particular, a correspondence
between the Bethe vectors of the Gaudin model of an inhomogenious magnetic
chain and the $\Bbb Q-$basis of the crystal base.
