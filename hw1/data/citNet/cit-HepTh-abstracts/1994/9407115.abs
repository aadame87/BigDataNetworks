Title: Residues in Non-Abelian Localization
Authors: Jaap Kalkman
Comments: 9 pages
\\
  In this paper we obtain an expression for the residue as it occurs in the
non-Abelian localization formula due to Jeffrey and Kirwan. This expression can
be used in cohomology computations for symplectic quotients.
