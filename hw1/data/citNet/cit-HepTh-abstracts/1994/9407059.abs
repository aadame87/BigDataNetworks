  A quantum theory is constructed for the system of a relativistic particle
with mass m moving freely on the SL(2,R) group manifold. Applied to the
cotangent bundle of SL(2,R), the method of Hamiltonian reduction allows us to
split the reduced system into two coadjoint orbits of the group. We find that
the Hilbert space consists of states given by the discrete series of the
unitary irreducible representations of SL(2,R), and with a positive-definite,
discrete spectrum.
