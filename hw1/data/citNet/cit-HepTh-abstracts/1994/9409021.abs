  and relation to WZW models based on non-semisimple groups)

  We prove that a large class of leading order string solutions which
generalize both the plane-wave and fundamental string backgrounds are, in fact,
exact solutions to all orders in \alpha'. These include, in particular, the
traveling waves along the fundamental string. The key features of these
solutions are a null symmetry and a chiral coupling of the string to the
background. Using dimensional reduction, one finds that the extremal electric
dilatonic black holes and their recently discovered generalizations with NUT
charge and rotation are also exact solutions. We show that our bosonic
solutions are also exact solutions of the heterotic string theory with no extra
gauge field background.
