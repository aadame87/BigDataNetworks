  The standard formalism of quantum theory is enhanced and definite meaning is
given to the concepts of experiment, measurement and event. Within this
approach one obtains a uniquely defined piecewise deterministic algorithm
generating quantum jumps, classical events and histories of single quantum
objects. The wave-function Monte Carlo method of Quantum Optics is generalized
and promoted to the level of a fundamental process generating all the real
events in Nature. The already worked out applications include SQUID-tank model
and generalized cloud chamber model with GRW spontaneous localization as a
particular case. Differences between the present approach and quantum
measurement theories based on environment induced master equations are
stressed. Questions: what is classical, what is time, and what are observers
are addressed. Possible applications of the new approach are suggested, among
them connection between the stochastic commutative geometry and
Connes'noncommutative formulation of the Standard Model, as well as potential
applications to the theory and practice of quantum computers.
