  The exact quantization of two models, the massive vector meson model and the
Higgs model in the London limit, both describing massive photons, is presented.
Even though naive arguments (based on gauge-fixing) may indicate the
equivalence of these models, it is shown here that this is not true in general
when we consider these theories on manifolds with boundaries. We show, in
particular, that they are equivalent only for a special choice of the boundary
conditions that we are allowed to impose on the fields.
