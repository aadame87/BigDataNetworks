  Recent progress on the complete set of solutions of two dimensional classical
string theory in any curved spacetime is reviewed. When the curvature is smooth
the string solutions are deformed folded string solutions as compared to flat
spacetime folded strings that were known for 19 years. However, surprizing new
stringy behavior becomes evident at singularities such as black holes. The
global properties of these solutions require that the ``bare singularity
region"of the black hole be included along with the usual black hole spacetime.
The mathematical structure needed to describe the solutions include a recursion
relation that is analogous to the transfer matrix of lattice theories. This
encodes lattice properties on the worldsheet on the one hand and the geometry
of spacetime on the other hand. A case is made for the presence of folded
strings in the quantum theory of non-critical strings for $d\geq 2$.
