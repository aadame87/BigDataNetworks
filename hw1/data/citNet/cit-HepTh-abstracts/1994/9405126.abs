  In this article we analyze a two dimensional lattice gauge theory based on a
quantum group.The algebra generated by gauge fields is the lattice algebra
introduced recently by A.Yu.Alekseev,H.Grosse and V.Schomerus we define and
study wilson loops and compute explicitely the partition function on any
Riemann surface. This theory appears to be related to Chern-Simons Theory.
