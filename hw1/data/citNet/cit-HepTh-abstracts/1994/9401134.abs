  High energy scattering in 2+1 QCD is studied using the recent approach of
Verlinde and Verlinde. We calculate the color singlet part of the quark-quark
scattering exactly within this approach, and discuss some physical implication
of this result. We also demonstrate, by two independent methods, that
reggeization fails for the color singlet channel. We briefly comment on the
problem in 3+1 QCD.
