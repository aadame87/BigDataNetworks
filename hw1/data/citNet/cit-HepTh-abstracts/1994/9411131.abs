  A residue-theoretic representation is given for massless matter fields in
(quotients) of (weighted) \CY\ complete intersection models and the
corresponding chiral operators in \LGO{s}.
  The well known polynomial deformations are thus generalized and the universal
but somewhat abstract Koszul computations acquire a concrete realization and a
general but more heuristic reinterpretation.
  A direct correspondence with a BRST-type analysis of constrained systems also
emerges naturally.
