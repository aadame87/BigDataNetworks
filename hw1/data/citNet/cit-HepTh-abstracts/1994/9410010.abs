  The set of modular invariants that can be obtained from Galois
transformations is investigated systematically for WZW models. It is shown that
a large subset of Galois modular invariants coincides with simple current
invariants. For algebras of type B and D infinite series of previously unknown
exceptional automorphism invariants are found.
