  The general structure of the representation theory of a $Z_2$-graded
coalgebra is discussed. The result contains the structure of Fourier analysis
on compact supergroups and quantisations thereof as a special case. The general
linear supergroups serve as an explicit illustration and the simplest example
is carried out in detail.
