  We describe how an approximation to the minimal energy Skyrme crystal can be
obtained from the holonomy of a Yang-Mills instanton. The appropriate instanton
is twisted on a four-torus and has instanton number equal to one half. It
generates a Skyrme field with the correct topological and symmetry properties
of the crystal. An explicit solution for the instanton is not known, but an
analytical fit to numerical data is available and using this we obtain a Skyrme
crystal whose energy is only 2 percent above that of the (numerically) known
solution.
