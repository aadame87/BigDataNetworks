Title: Weyl Pair, Current Algebra and Shift Operator
Authors: Zhan-Ning Hu
Comments: 8 pages, latex file, AS-ITP-94-52
\\
  The Abelian current algebra on the lattice is given from a series of the
independent Weyl pairs and the shift operator is constructed by this algebra.
So the realization of the operators of the braid group is obtained. For
$|q|\neq 1$ the shift operator is the product of the theta functions of the
generators $w_n$ of the current algebra. For $|q|=1$ it can be expressed by the
quantum dilogarithm of $w_n$.
