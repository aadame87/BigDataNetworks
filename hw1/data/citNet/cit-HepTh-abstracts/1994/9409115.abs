  Starting from linear equations for the complex scalar field, the two- and
three-point Green's functions are obtained in the infrared approximation. We
show that the infrared singularity factorizes in the vertex function as in
spinorial QED, reproducing in a straightforward way the result of lenghty
perturbative calculations.
