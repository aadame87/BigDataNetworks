  Protective measurements yield properties of the quantum state of a single
quantum system without affecting the quantum state. A protective measurement
involves adiabatic coupling to the measuring device together with a procedure
to protect the state from changing. For nondegenerate energy eigenstates the
protection is provided by the system itself. In this case it is actually
possible to measure the Schr\"odinger wave via measurements on a single system.
This fact provides an argument in favor of associating physical reality with a
quantum state of a single system, challenging the usual ensemble
interpretation. We also believe that the complete description of a quantum
system requires a two-state vector formalism involving (in addition to the
usual one)a future quantum state evolving backwards in time. Protective
measurements testing the two-state vector reality are constructed.
