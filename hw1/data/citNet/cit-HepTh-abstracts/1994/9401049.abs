  A generalisation of the classical Calogero-Moser model obtained by coupling
it to the Gaudin model is considered. The recently found classical dynamical
r-matrix [E. Billey, J. Avan and O. Babelon, PAR LPTHE 93-55] for the
Euler-Calogero-Moser model is used to separate variables for this generalised
Calogero-Moser model in the case in which there are two Calogero-Moser
particles. The model is then canonically quantised and the same classical
r-matrix is employed to separate variables in the Schr\"odinger equations.
