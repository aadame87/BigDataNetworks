  {}From the cyclic quantum dilogarithm the shift operator is constructed with
$q$ is a root of unit and the representation is given for the current algebra
introduced by Faddeev $et ~al$. It is shown that the theta-function is
factorizable also in this case by using the star-square equation of the
Baxter-Bazhanov model.
