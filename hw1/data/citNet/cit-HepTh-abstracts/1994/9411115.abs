  The $\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ Poincar{\'e} superalgebra written in Hopf
superalgebra form is transformed to the basis with classical Lorentz subalgebra
generators. We show that in such a basis the $\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ Poincare
superalgebra can be written as graded bicrossproduct. We show that the
$\kappa$-deformed $D=4$ superalgebra acts covariantly on $\kappa$-deformed
chiral superspace.
