\\
  Supersymmetry breaking in string theory is expected to occur when moduli
fields acquire non-trivial expectation values. In the early universe these
fields start out displaced from their final destinations. I present some recent
ideas about the cosmological evolution of the dilaton modulus field on the way
to its vacuum expectation value.
