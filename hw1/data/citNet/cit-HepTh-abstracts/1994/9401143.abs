  The grand-canonical ensemble of dynamically triangulated surfaces coupled to
four species of Ising spins (c=2) is simulated on a computer. The effective
string susceptibility exponent for lattices with up to 1000 vertices is found
to be $\gamma = - 0.195(58)$. A specific scenario for $c > 1$ models is
conjectured.
