  Definition of Feynman integrals as solutions of some well defined systems of
differential equations is proposed. This definition is equivalent to usual one
but needs no regularization and application of $R$-operation. It is argued that
proposed renormalization scheme maintains all symmetries that can be maintained
in perturbative quantum field theory, and also is convenient for practical
calculations.
