  New stationary solutions of $4$-dimensional dilaton-axion gravity are
presented, which correspond to the charged Taub-NUT and Israel-Wilson-Perjes
(IWP) solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory. The charged axion-dilaton Taub-NUT
solutions are shown to have a number of interesting properties: i) manifest
$SL(2,R)$ symmetry, ii) an infinite throat in an extremal limit, iii) the
throat limit coincides with an exact CFT construction.
  The IWP solutions are shown to admit supersymmetric Killing spinors, when
embedded in $d=4,N=4$ supergravity. This poses a problem for the interpretation
of supersymmetric rotating solutions as physical ground states. In the context
of $10$-dimensional geometry, we show that dimensionally lifted versions of the
IWP solutions are dual to certain gravitational waves in string theory.
