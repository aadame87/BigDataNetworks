  The Brattelli diagram associated with a given bicolored Dynkin-Coxeter graph
of type $A_n$ determines planar fractal sets obtained by infinite dissections
of a given triangle. All triangles appearing in the dissection process have
angles that are multiples of $\pi/ (n+1).$ There are usually several possible
infinite dissections compatible with a given $n$ but a given one makes use of
$n/2$ triangle types if $n$ is even. Jones algebra with index $[ 4 \ \cos^2{\pi
\over n+1}]^{-1}$ (values of the discrete range) act naturally on vector spaces
associated with those fractal sets. Triangles of a given type are always
congruent at each step of the dissection process. In the particular case $n=4$,
there are isometric and the whole structure lead, after proper inflation, to
aperiodic Penrose tilings. The ``tilings'' associated with other values of the
index are discussed and shown to be encoded by equivalence classes of infinite
sequences (with appropriate constraints) using $n/2$ digits (if $n$ is even)
and generalizing the Fibonacci numbers.
