  We present a systematic introduction to the geometry of linear braided
spaces. These are versions of $\R^n$ in which the coordinates $x_i$ have
braid-statistics described by an R-matrix. From this starting point we survey
the author's braided-approach to $q$-deformation: braided differentiation,
exponentials, Gaussians, integration and forms, i.e. the basic ingredients for
$q$-deformed physics are covered. The braided approach includes natural
$q$-Euclidean and $q$-Minkowski spaces in R-matrix form.
