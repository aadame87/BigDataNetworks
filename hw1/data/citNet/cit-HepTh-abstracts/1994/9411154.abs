  In this letter, we present the action for the massive super-{\QED}. A pair of
chiral and a pair of anti-chiral superfields with opposite U(1)-charges are
required. We also carry out a dimensional reduction {\it{\`a la}} Scherk from
(2+2) to (1+2) dimensions, and we show that, after suitable truncations are
performed, the supersymmetric extension of the ${\tau}_{3}$QED$_{1+2}$
naturally comes out.
