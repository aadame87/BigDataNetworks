  A novel Hopf algebra $ ( {\tilde G}_{r,s} )$, depending on two deformation
parameters and five generators, has been constructed. This $ {\tilde G}_{r,s}$
Hopf algebra might be considered as some quantisation of classical $GL(2)
\otimes GL(1) $ group, which contains the standard $GL_q(2)$ quantum group
(with $ q=r^{-1} $) as a Hopf subalgebra. However, we interestingly observe
that the two parameter deformed $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group can also be
realised through the generators of this $ {\tilde G}_{r,s}$ algebra, provided
the sets of deformation parameters $p,~q$ and $r,~s$ are related to each other
in a particular fashion. Subsequently we construct the invariant noncommutative
planes associated with $ {\tilde G}_{r,s}$ algebra and show how the two well
known Manin planes corresponding to $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group can easily be
reproduced through such construction. Finally we consider the `coloured'
extension of $GL_{p,q}(2)$ quantum group as well as corresponding Manin planes
and explore their intimate connection with the `coloured' extension of
${\tilde G}_{r,s}$ Hopf structure.
