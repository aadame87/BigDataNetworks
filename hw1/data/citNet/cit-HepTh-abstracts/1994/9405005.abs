  We suggest that the spectral properties near zero virtuality of three
dimensional QCD, follow from a Hermitean random matrix model. The exact
spectral density is derived for this family of random matrix models both for
even and odd number of fermions. New sum rules for the inverse powers of the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are obtained. The issue of anomalies in
random matrix theories is discussed.
