  We diagonalize the transfer matrix of the inhomogeneous vertex models of the
6-vertex type in the anti-ferroelectric regime intoducing new types of q-vertex
operators. The special cases of those models were used to diagonalize the s-d
exchange model\cite{W,A,FW1}. New vertex operators are constructed from the
level one vertex operators by the fusion procedure and have the description by
bosons. In order to clarify the particle structure we estabish new isomorphisms
of crystals. The results are very simple and figure out representation
theoretically the ground state degenerations.
