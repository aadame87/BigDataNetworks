  Auxiliary string fields are introduced in light-cone gauge string field
theory in order to express contact interactions as contractions of cubic
vertices. The auxiliary field in the purely closed-string bosonic theory may be
given a non-zero expectation value, leading to a phase in which world-sheets
have boundaries.
