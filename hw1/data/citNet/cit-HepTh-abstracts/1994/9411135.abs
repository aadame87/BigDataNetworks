  New relations of correlation functions are found in topological string
theory; one for each second cohomology class of the target space. They are
close cousins of the Deligne-Dijkgraaf-Witten's puncture and dilaton equations.
When combined with the dilaton equation and the ghost number conservation, the
equation for the first chern class of the target space gives a constraint on
the topological sum (over genera and (multi-)degrees) of partition functions.
For the $\CP^1$ model, it coincides with the dilatation constraint which is
derivable in the matrix model recently introduced by Eguchi and Yang.
