  We recently obtained the conditions on the couplings of the general
two-dimensional massive sigma-model required by (p,q)-supersymmetry. Here we
compute the Poisson bracket algebra of the supersymmetry and central Noether
charges, and show that the action is invariant under the automorphism group of
this algebra. Surprisingly, for the (4,4) case the automorphism group is always
a subgroup of SO(3), rather than SO(4). We also reanalyse the conditions for
the (2,2) and (4,4) supersymmetry of the zero torsion models without
assumptions about the central charge matrix.
