  The Pauli Hamiltonian for a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ charged particle interacting
with a point magnetic vortex and $1/r^{2}$ potential exhibits a dynamical
supersymmetry $Osp(1,1)$ on the plane except at the origin. Using this
symmetry, the spectrum and the wave functions have been obtained. And, the
dynamical supersymmetry could be imported to the case when an external harmonic
potential is added.
