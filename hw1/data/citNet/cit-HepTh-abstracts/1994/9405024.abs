  In four-dimensional compactifications of the heterotic superstring theory the
K\"ahler potential has a form which generically induces a superpotential mass
term for Higgs particles once supersymmetry is broken at low energies. This
``$\mu$-term'' is analyzed in a model-independent way at the tree level and in
the one-loop approximation, and explicit expressions are obtained for orbifold
compactifications. Additional contributions which arise in the case of
supersymmetry breaking induced by gaugino condensation are also discussed.
