  I present a solution to the Schwinger model in the light-cone representation
which corrects an error in a previous work. I emphasize the details of the
mechanism by which the physical vacuum is different than the perturbative
vacuum. I suggest that the method of analyzing vacuum structure presented here
may be of use in more complicated theories such as QCD.
