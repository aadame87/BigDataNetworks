Title: Algebra of potentials of the volume-preserving vector fields
Authors: R.L. Mkrtchyan
Comments: 7 pages
\\
  The algebra of volume-preserving vector fields is considered. The potentials
for that fields are introduced, and induced algebra of potentials is
considered. It is shown, that this algebra fails to satisfy the Jacoby
identity. Analogy with hamiltonian mechanics is developed, as well as 3-cocycle
interpretation of corresponding expressions.
