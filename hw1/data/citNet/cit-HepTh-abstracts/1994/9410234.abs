  Based on the scaling relation for the dynamics at the early time, a new
method is proposed to measure both the static and dynamic critical exponents.
The method is applied to the two dimensional Ising model. The results are in
good agreement with the existing results. Since the measurement is carried out
in the initial stage of the relaxation process starting from independent
initial configurations, our method is efficient.
