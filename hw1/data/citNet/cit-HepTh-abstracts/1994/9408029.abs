  I investigate the Kazakov-Migdal (KM) model -- the Hermitean gauge-invariant
matrix model on a D-dimensional lattice. I utilize an exact large-N solution of
the KM model with a logarithmic potential to examine its critical behavior. I
find critical lines associated with gamma_{string}=-1/2 and gamma_{string}=0 as
well as a tri-critical point associated with a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase
transition. The continuum theories are constructed expanding around the
critical points. The one associated with gamma_{string}=0 coincides with the
standard d=1 string while the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition separates it
from that with gamma_{string}=-1/2 which is indistinguishable from pure 2D
gravity for local observables but has a continuum limit for correlators of
extended Wilson loops at large distances due to a singular behavior of the
Itzykson-Zuber correlator of the gauge fields. I reexamine the KM model with an
arbitrary potential in the large-D limit and show that it reduces at large N to
a one-matrix model whose potential is determined self-consistently. A relation
with discretized random surfaces is established via the gauged Potts model
which is equivalent to the KM model at large N providing the coordination
numbers coincide.
