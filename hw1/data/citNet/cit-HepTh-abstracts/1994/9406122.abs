  We construct the theoretical base for the search of the possible experimental
manifestations of the torsion field at low energies. The weakrelativistic
approximation to the Dirac equation in an external torsion field is considered.
For the sake of generality we introduce the external electromagnetic field in
parallel. The generalized (due to torsion dependent terms) Pauly equation
contains new terms which have the different structure if compared with standard
electromagnetic ones. Just the same takes place for the weakrelativistic
equations for spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particle in an external torsion and
electromagnetic field. It is given the brief description of the possible
experiments.
