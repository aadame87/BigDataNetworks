  In this paper we outline an approach to calculus over quasitriangular Hopf
algebras. We study differential operators in the framework of monoidal
categories equipped with a braiding or symmetry. To be more concrete, we choose
as an example the category of modules over quasitriangular Hopf algebra. We
introduce braided differential operators in a pure algebraic manner.This gives
us a possibility to develop calculus in an intrinsic way without enforcing any
type of Leibniz rule. A general notion of quantization in monoidal categories,
proposed in this paper, is a natural isomorphism of the tensor product
bifunctor equipped with some natural coherence conditions. The quantization
"deforms" all algebraic and differential objects in the monoidal category. We
suggest two ways for calculation of quantizations. One of them reduces the
calculation to non-linear cohomologies. THe other describes quantizations in
terms of multiplicative Hochschild cohomologies of the Grothendieck ring of the
given monoidal category. These constructions are illustrated by some examples.
