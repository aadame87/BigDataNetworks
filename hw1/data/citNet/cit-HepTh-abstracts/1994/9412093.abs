  The complex-time formalism is developed in the framework of the path-integral
formalism, to be used for analysis of the quantum tunneling phenomena. We show
that subleading complex-time saddle-points do not account for the right WKB
result. Instead, we develop a reduction formula, which enables us to construct
Green functions from simple components of the potential, for which saddle-point
method is applicable. This method leads us to the valid WKB result, which
incorporates imaginary-time instantons and bounces, as well as the real-time
boundary conditions.
