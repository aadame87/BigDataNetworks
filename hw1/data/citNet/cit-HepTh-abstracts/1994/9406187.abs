  We present the effective potential for nonrelativistic matter coupled to
non-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge fields. We perform the calculation using a
functional method in constant background fields to satisfy Gauss's law and to
simplify the computation. Both the quantum gauge and matter fields are
integrated over. The gauge fixing is achieved with an $R_\xi$-gauge in the
$\xi\to 0$ limit. Divergences appearing in the matter sector are regulated via
operator regularization. We find no corrections to the Chern-Simons coupling
constant and the system experiences conformal symmetry breaking to one-loop
order except at the known value of self-duality. These results agree with
previous analysis of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm scattering.
