Title: Strong Phase Correlations of Solitons of Nonlinear Schr\"odinger
  Equation

  We discuss the possibility to suppress the collapse in the nonlinear 2+1 D
Schr\"odinger equation by using the gauge theory of strong phase correlations.
It is shown that invariance relative to $q$-deformed Hopf algebra with
deformation parameter $q$ being the fourth root of unity makes the values of
the Chern-Simons term coefficient, $k=2$, and of the coupling constant,
$g=1/2$, fixed; no collapsing solutions are present at those values.
