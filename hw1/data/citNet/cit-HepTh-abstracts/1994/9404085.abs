Title: Multi-scale Renormalisation Group Improvement of the Effective Potential
Authors: Chris Ford
Comments: 19 pages, DIAS STP 94-09. Expanded to check large N limit, typo's
  corrected, to appear in Phys Rev D
Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D50 (1994) 7531-7537
\\
  Using the renormalisation group and a conjecture concerning the perturbation
series for the effective potential, the leading logarithms in the effective
potential are exactly summed for $O(N)$ scalar and Yukawa theories.
