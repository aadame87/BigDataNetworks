  The notion of a translation map in a quantum principal bundle is introduced.
A translation map is then used to prove that the cross sections of a quantum
fibre bundle $E(B,V,A)$ associated to a quantum principal bundle $P(B,A)$ are
in bijective correspondence with equivariant maps $V\to P$, and that a quantum
principal bundle is trivial if it admits a cross section which is an algebra
map. The vertical automorphisms and gauge transformations of a quantum
principal bundle are discussed. In particular it is shown that vertical
automorphisms are in bijective correspondence with $\ad$-covariant maps $A\to
P$.
