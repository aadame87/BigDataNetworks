  In comparison with the $WT$ chiral identity which is indispensable for
renormalization theory, relations deduced from the non-linear chiral
transformation have a totally different physical significance. We wish to show
that non-linear chiral transformations are powerful tools to deduce useful
integral equations for propagators. In contrast to the case of linear chiral
transformations, identities derived from non-linear ones contain more involved
radiative effects and are rich in physical content. To demonstrate this fact we
apply the simplest non-linear chiral transformation to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model, and show how our identity is related to the Dyson-Schwinger equation and
Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes of the Higgs and $\pi$. Unlike equations obtained
from the effective potential, our resultant equation is exact and can be used
for events beyond the LEP energy.
