Title: A Comment on Black Hole Entropy in String Theory
Authors: William Nelson
Comments: 8 pages, uses harvmac and epsf, two postscript figures appended. (A
  page is added describing how to do the computation rigorously. Also some
  notation is altered.)

  In this note, we extend the string theoretic calculation of the black hole
entropy, first performed by Susskind and Uglum, away from the infinite mass
limit. It is shown that the result agrees with that obtained from the classical
action of string theory, using the Noether charge method developed by Wald.
Also shown in the process is the equivalence of two general techniques for
finding black hole entropies-the Noether charge method, and the method of
conical singularities.
