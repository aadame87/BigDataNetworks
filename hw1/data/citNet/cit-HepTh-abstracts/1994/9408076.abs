  The strong coupling physics of two dimensional gravity at $C=7$, $13$, $19$
is deciphered, by building up on previous works along the same line (for a
recent review, of the background material, see hep-th/9408069). It is shown
that chirality becomes deconfined. The string suceptibility is derived, and
found to be real contrary to the continuation of the KPZ formula. Topological
Liouville string theories (without transverse degree of freedom) are
explicitely solved. Altough they involve strongly coupled gravity, they share
many features with the standard matrix models.
