Title: Obstructions to Gauging WZ Terms: a Symplectic Curiosity
Authors: J.M. Figueroa-O'Farrill

\\
  This is an expository talk about the relation between gauging the WZ term of
a one-dimensional sigma-model with a symplectic target and the existence of an
equivariant moment mapping for symplectic group actions. The punch line is that
the obstructions for gauging coincide with the obstructions for the existence
of the moment mapping. This paper can be thought of a "prequel" of
hep-th/9407149.
