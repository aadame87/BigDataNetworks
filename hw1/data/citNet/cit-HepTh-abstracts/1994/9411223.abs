  In this paper the free gauge field theories on a Riemann surface of any genus
are quantized in the covariant gauge. The propagators of the gauge fields are
explicitly derived and their properties are analysed in details. As an
application, the correlation functions of a Yang-Mills field theory with gauge
group $SU(N)$ are computed at the lowest order.
