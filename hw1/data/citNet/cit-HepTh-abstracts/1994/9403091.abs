  We derive the first order canonical formulation of cosmological perturbation
theory in a Universe filled by a few scalar fields. This theory is quantized
via well-defined Hamiltonian path integral. The propagator which describes the
evolution of the initial (for instance, vacuum) state, is calculated.
