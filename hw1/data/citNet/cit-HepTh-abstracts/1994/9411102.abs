  Recent developments in the understanding of $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory in four dimensions suggest a new point of view about Donaldson theory of
four manifolds: instead of defining four-manifold invariants by counting
$SU(2)$ instantons, one can define equivalent four-manifold invariants by
counting solutions of a non-linear equation with an abelian gauge group. This
is a ``dual'' equation in which the gauge group is the dual of the maximal
torus of $SU(2)$. The new viewpoint suggests many new results about the
Donaldson invariants.
