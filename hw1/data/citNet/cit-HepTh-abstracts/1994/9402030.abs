  We show that introducing a periodic time coordinate in the models of
Penner-Kontsevich type generalizes the corresponding constructions to the case
of the moduli space ${\cal S}_{gn}^k$ of curves $C$ with homology chains
$\gamma\in H_1(C,\zet_k)$. We make a minimal extension of the resulting models
by adding a kinetic term, and we get a new matrix model which realizes a simple
dynamics of $\zet_k$-chains on surfaces. This gives a representation of $c=1$
matter coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity with the target space being a
circle of finite radius, as studied by Gross and Klebanov.
