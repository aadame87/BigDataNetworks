  In this talk the class of multi-fields reductions of the KP and super-KP
hierarchies (leading to non-purely differential Lax operators) is revisited
from the point of view of coset construction. This means in particular that all
the hamiltonian densities of the infinite tower belong to a coset algebra of a
given Poisson brackets structure.
