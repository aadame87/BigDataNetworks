  Starting with the Taub--NUT solution to Einstein's equations, together with a
constant dilaton, a dyonic Taub--NUT solution of low energy heterotic string
theory with non--trivial dilaton, axion and $U(1)$ gauge fields is constructed
by employing $O(1,1)$ transformations. The electromagnetic dual of this
solution is constructed, using $SL(2,\rline)$ transformations. By an
appropriate change to scaled variables, the extremal limit of the dual solution
is shown to correspond to the low energy limit of an exact conformal field
theory presented previously.
