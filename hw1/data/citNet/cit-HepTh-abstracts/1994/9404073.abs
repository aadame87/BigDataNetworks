  The string theory defined by gauging $\W_{\infty/2}$, the sub-algebra of
$\W_{\infty}$ generated by the currents of even spin, is discussed. The
critical value of the central charge is calculated using zeta-function
techniques and shown to be $c=1$. A critical string theory is constructed by
coupling a free boson to $\W_{\infty/2}$-gravity and the physical states are
analysed.
