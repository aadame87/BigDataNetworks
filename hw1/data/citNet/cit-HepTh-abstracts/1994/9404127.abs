Title: The Quantum Mechanics of a "Spinor-twin" Type II Superparticle
Author: J.L. Vazquez-Bello
Comments: 8 pages. TeX-file
\\
  Ten dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory may be described, in the
light-cone gauge, in terms of either a vector or spinor superfield satisfying
certain projection conditions (type I or II). These have been presented in a $
SO(9,1) $ form, and used to construct spinning superparticle theories in
extended spaces. This letter presents the covariant quantisation of a
"spinor-twin" type II superparticle theory by using the standard techniques of
Batalin and Vilkovisky. The quantum action defines a quadratic field theory,
whose ghost-independent BRST cohomology class gives the spectrum of N=1 super
Yang-Mills.
