  We investigate (1+1)-dimensional $\phi^4$ field theory in the symmetric and
broken phases using discrete light-front quantization. We calculate the
perturbative solution of the zero-mode constraint equation for both the
symmetric and broken phases and show that standard renormalization of the
theory yields finite results. We study the perturbative zero-mode contribution
to two diagrams and show that the light-front formulation gives the same result
as the equal-time formulation. In the broken phase of the theory, we obtain the
nonperturbative solutions of the constraint equation and confirm our previous
speculation that the critical coupling is logarithmically divergent. We discuss
the renormalization of this divergence but are not able to find a satisfactory
nonperturbative technique. Finally we investigate properties that are
insensitive to this divergence, calculate the critical exponent of the theory,
and find agreement with mean field theory as expected.
