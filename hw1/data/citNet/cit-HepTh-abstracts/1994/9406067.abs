  We construct two new classes of exact solutions to string theory which are
not of the standard plane wave or gauged WZW type. Many of these solutions have
curvature singularities. The first class includes the fundamental string
solution, for which the string coupling vanishes near the singularity. This
suggests that the singularity may not be removed by quantum corrections. The
second class consists of hybrids of plane wave and gauged WZW solutions. We
discuss a four dimensional example in detail.
