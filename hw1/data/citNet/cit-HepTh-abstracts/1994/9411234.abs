  We study some arithmetic properties of the mirror maps and the quantum Yukawa
coupling for some 1-parameter deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. First we
use the Schwarzian differential equation, which we derived previously, to
characterize the mirror map in each case. For algebraic K3 surfaces, we solve
the equation in terms of the $J$-function. By deriving explicit modular
relations we prove that some K3 mirror maps are algebraic over the genus zero
function field ${\bf Q}(J)$. This leads to a uniform proof that those mirror
maps have integral Fourier coefficients. Regarding the maps as Riemann
mappings, we prove that they are genus zero functions. By virtue of the
Conway-Norton conjecture (proved by Borcherds using Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman's
Moonshine module), we find that these maps are actually the reciprocals of the
Thompson series for certain conjugacy classes in the Griess-Fischer group. This
also gives, as an immediate consequence, a second proof that those mirror maps
are integral. We thus conjecture a surprising connection between K3 mirror maps
and the Thompson series. For threefolds, we construct a formal nonlinear ODE
for the quantum coupling reduced $mod\ p$. Under the mirror hypothesis and an
integrality assumption, we derive $mod~p$ congruences for the Fourier
coefficients. For the quintics, we deduce (at least for $5\not{|}d$) that the
degree $d$ instanton numbers $n_d$ are divisible by $5^3$ -- a fact first
conjectured by Clemens.
