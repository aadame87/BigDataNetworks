  For a certain class of Lie bialgebras $(A,A^*)$ the corresponding quantum
universal enveloping algebras $U_q(A)$ are prooved to be equivalent to quantum
groups Fun$_q(F^*)$, $F^*$ being the factor group for the dual group $G^*$.
This property can be used to simplify the process of quantization. The
described class appears to be wide enough to contain all the standard
quantizations of infinite series. The properties of the groups $F^*$ are
explicitly demonstrated for the standard deformations $U_q(SL(n))$. It is shown
that for different $A^*$ (remaining in the described class of Lie bialgebras)
the same algorithm leads to the nonstandard quantizations.
