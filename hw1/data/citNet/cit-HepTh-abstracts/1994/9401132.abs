  A consistent procedure of canonical quantization of pseudoclassical model for
spin one relativistic particle is considered. Two approaches to treat the
quantization for the massless case are discussed, the limit of the massive case
and independent quantization of a modified action. Quantum mechanics
constructed for the massive case proves to be equivalent to the Proca theory
and for massless case to the Maxwell theory. Results obtained are compared with
ones for the case of spinning (spin one half) particle.
