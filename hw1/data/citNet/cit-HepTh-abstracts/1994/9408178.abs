  A topological version of four-dimensional (Euclidean) Einstein gravity which
we propose regards anti-self-dual 2-forms and an anti-self-dual part of the
frame connections as fundamental fields. The theory describes the moduli spaces
of conformally self-dual Einstein manifolds for the non-zero cosmological
constant case and Einstein-Kahlerian manifold with the vanishing real first
Chern class for the zero cosmological constant. In the non-zero cosmological
constant case, we evaluate the index of the elliptic complex associated with
the moduli space and calculate the partition function. We also clarify the
moduli space and its dimension for the zero cosmological constant case which
are related to the Plebansky's heavenly equations.
