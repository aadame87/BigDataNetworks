Title: The Infinite Symmetry and Interplay Between Integer and Fractional
  Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: M.Eliashvili
Comments: 10p. ENSLAPP-A-462/94
\\
  It is shown, that a spectrum generating algebras and wave functions for the
integral and fractional quantum Hall effect are related by the non-unitary
similarity transformation. This transformation corresponds to the introduction
of the complex Chern-Simons gauge fields, in terms of which the second
quantized form of FQHE can be developed
