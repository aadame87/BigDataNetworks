Title: Vacuum polarization around a straight wire carrying a steady current

\\
  Motivated by the example of the superconducting cosmic string which can be a
physical representation of a straight wire carrying a steady current, we derive
in this case the explicit expressions of the induced vector potential, current
density and magnetic field due to the vacuum polarization at the first order in
the fine structure constant.
