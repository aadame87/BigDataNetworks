  In this note we prove the Davies-Foda-Jimbo-Miwa-Nakayashiki conjecture on
the asymptotics of the composition of n quantum vertex operators for the
quantum affine algebra U_q(\hat sl_2), as n goes to infinity. For this purpose
we define and study the leading eigenvalue and eigenvector of the product of
two components of the quantum vertex operator. This eigenvector and the
corresponding eigenvalue were recently computed by M.Jimbo. The results of his
computation are given in Section 4.
