  We show that the argument in Phys Rev Lett 70 (1993) 1360 is correct and
consistent, and that Hagen & Sudarshan's solution has inconsistency leading to
non-vanishing commutators of $[P^1, P^2]$ and $[P^j, H]$ even in physical
states. This proves that many of HS's statements in their Comment are based
merely on incorrect guess, but not on careful algebra.
