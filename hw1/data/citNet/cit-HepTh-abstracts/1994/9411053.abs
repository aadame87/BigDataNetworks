  On the basis of the collective field method, we analyze the
Calogero--Sutherland model (CSM) and the Selberg--Aomoto integral, which
defines, in particular case, the partition function of the matrix models.
Vertex operator realizations for some of the eigenstates (the Jack polynomials)
of the CSM Hamiltonian are obtained. We derive Virasoro constraint for the
generalized matrix models and indicate relations with the CSM operators.
Similar results are presented for the $q$--deformed case (the Macdonald
operator and polynomials), which gives the generating functional of infinitely
many conserved charges in the CSM.
