Title: Hidden Symmetries in the 6-Vertex Model of Statistical Physics
Author: Igor G. Korepanov
Comments: An English version of the author's article which recently appeared in
  Zapiski Nauvhnyh Seminarov POMI (S-Petersburg) and is based on two older
  papers (of 1987) mentioned in the bibliography. The author's Russian paper of
  1986 from the bibliography will soon appear in English, too
Journal-ref: Zap.Nauchn.Semin. 215 (1994) 163-177

  The transfer matrix of the 6-vertex model of two-dimensional statistical
physics commutes with many (more complicated) transfer matrices, but these
latter, generally, do not commute between each other. The studying of their
action in the eigenspaces of the 6-vertex model transfer matrix becomes
possible due to a ``multiplicative property'' of the {\em vacuum curves\/} of
$\cal L$-operators from which transfer matrices are built. This approach
allowed, in particular, to discover for the first time the fact that the
dimensions of abovementioned eigenspaces must be multiples of (big enough)
degrees of the number 2.
