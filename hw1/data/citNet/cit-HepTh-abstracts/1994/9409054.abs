  Using duality and topological theory of well behaved Hopf algebras (as
defined in [2]) we construct star-product models of non compact quantum groups
from Drinfeld and Reshetikhin standard deformations of enveloping Hopf algebras
of simple Lie algebras. Our star-products act not only on coefficient functions
of finite-dimensional representations, but actually on all $C^\infty$
functions, and they exist even for non linear (semi-simple) Lie groups.
