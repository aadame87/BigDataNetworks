  We propose a spinon basis for the integrable highest weight modules of
$\hsltw$ at levels $k\geq1$, and discuss the underlying Yangian symmetry.
Evaluating the characters in this spinon basis provides new quasi-particle type
expressions for the characters of these integrable modules, and explicitly
exhibits the structure of an RSOS times a Yangian part, known \eg from
$S$-matrix results. We briefly discuss generalizations to other groups and more
general conformal field theories.
