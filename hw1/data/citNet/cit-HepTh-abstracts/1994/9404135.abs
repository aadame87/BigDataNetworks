Title: Black hole entropy and the semiclassical approximation
Authors: Samir D. Mathur
Comments: 9 pages, 1 figure (included), plain tex. (Section on quantum gravity
  is rewritten to explain basic ideas more clearly.)

  We compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation for an evaporating black
hole, in 1+1 dimensions and in 3+1 dimensions. We investigate the validity of
the semiclassical approximation for the evaporation process. It appears that
there might be a large entropy of entanglement between the classical degrees of
freedom describing the black hole and the radiation fields when the theory of
quantum gravity plus matter is considered.
