  We give a systematic account of the exterior algebra of forms on q-Minkowski
space, introducing the q-exterior derivative, q-Hodge star operator,
q-coderivative, q-Laplace-Beltrami operator and the q-Lie-derivative. With
these tools at hand, we then give a detailed exposition of the q-d'Alembert and
q-Maxwell equation. For both equations we present a q-momentum-indexed family
of plane wave solutions. We also discuss the gauge freedom of the q-Maxwell
field and give a q-spinor analysis of the q-field strength tensor.
