  In this paper we give a new derivation of the quark-antiquark potential in
the Wilson loop context. This makes more explicit the approximations involved
and enables an immediate extension to the three-quark case. In the
$q\overline{q}$ case we find the same semirelativistic potential obtained in
preceding papers but for a question of ordering. In the $3q$ case we find a
spin dependent potential identical to that already derived in the literature
from the ad hoc and non correct assumption of scalar confinement. Furthermore
we obtain the correct form of the spin independent potential up to the $1/m^2$
order.
