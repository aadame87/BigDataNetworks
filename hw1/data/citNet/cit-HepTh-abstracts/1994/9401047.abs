  This paper is devoted to an interaction of 2 objects: the 1st of them is
octonions, the classical structure of pure mathematics, the 2nd one is
Mobilevision, the recently developped technique of computer graphics. Namely,
it is shown that the binocular Mobilevision maybe elaborated by use of the
octonionic colour space - the 7-dimensional extension of the classical one,
which includes a strange overcolour besides two triples of ordinary ones
(blue,green, red for left and right eyes).
