  We define a natural generalized symmetry of the Yang-Mills equations as an
infinitesimal transformation of the Yang-Mills field, built in a local, gauge
invariant, and Poincar\'e invariant fashion from the Yang-Mills field strength
and its derivatives to any order, which maps solutions of the field equations
to other solutions. On the jet bundle of Yang-Mills connections we introduce a
spinorial coordinate system that is adapted to the solution subspace defined by
the Yang-Mills equations. In terms of this coordinate system the complete
classification of natural symmetries is carried out in a straightforward
manner. We find that all natural symmetries of the Yang-Mills equations stem
from the gauge transformations admitted by the equations.
