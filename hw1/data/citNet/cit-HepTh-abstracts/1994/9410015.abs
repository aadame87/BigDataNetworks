Comments: 9 pages, OU-HET 190, revised version. A part of the conclusions has
  been corrected. A new result on integral representation of the annulus
  amplitudes has been added

\\
  An explicit expression for continuum annulus amplitudes having boundary
lengths $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ is obtained from the two-matrix model for the
case of the unitary series; $(p,q) = (m + 1, m)$. In the limit of vanishing
cosmological constant, we find an integral representation of these amplitudes
which is reproduced, for the cases of the $m = 2~(c=0)$ and the $m \rightarrow
\infty~(c=1)$, by a continuum approach consisting of quantum mechanics of loops
and a matter system integrated over the modular parameter of the annulus. We
comment on a possible relation to the unconventional branch of the Liouville
gravity.
