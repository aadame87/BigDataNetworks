  The question of the integrability of real-coupling affine toda field theory
on a half line is discussed. It is shown, by examining low-spin conserved
charges, that the boundary conditions preserving integrability are strongly
constrained. In particular, among the cases treated so far, $e_6^{(1)}$,
$d_n^{(1)}$ and $a_n^{(1)}, \ n\ge 2$, there can be no free parameters
introduced by such boundary conditions; indeed the only remaining freedom
(apart from choosing the simple condition $\partial_1\phi =0$), resides in a
choice of signs. For a special case of the boundary condition, accessible only
for $a_n^{(1)}$, it is pointed out that the classical boundary bound state
spectrum may be related to a set of reflection factors in the quantum field
theory. Some preliminary calculations are reported for other boundary
conditions, demonstrating that the classical scattering data satisfies the weak
coupling limit of the reflection bootstrap equation. (Invited talk at \lq
