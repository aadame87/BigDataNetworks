  We present a ``topological'' formulation of arbitrarily shaped vortex strings
in four dimensional field theory. By using a large Higgs mass expansion, we
then evaluate the effective action of the closed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen
vortex string. It is shown that the effective action contains the Nambu-Goto
term and an extrinsic curvature squared term with negative sign. We next
evaluate the topological $\FtF$ term and find that it becomes the sum of an
ordinary self-intersection number and Polyakov's self-intersection number of
the world sheet swept by the vortex string. These self-intersection numbers are
related to the self-linking number and the total twist number, respectively.
Furthermore, the $\FtF$ term turns out to be the difference between the sum of
the writhing numbers and the linking numbers of the vortex strings at the
initial time and the one at the final time. When the vortex string is coupled
to fermions, the chiral fermion number of the vortex string becomes the
writhing number (modulo $\bZ$) through the chiral anomaly. Our formulation is
also applied to ``global'' vortex strings in a model with a broken global
$U(1)$ symmetry.
