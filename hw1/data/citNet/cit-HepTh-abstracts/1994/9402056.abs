  We prove that the supersymmetric BKP-hierarchy of Yu (SBKP_2) is hamiltonian
with respect to a nonlinear extension of the N=1 Super-Virasoro algebra
(W_SBKP) by fields of spin k, where k>3/2 and 2k = 0,3 mod 4. Moreover, we show
how to associate in a similar manner an N=1 W-superalgebra with every
integrable hierarchy of the SKdV-type. We also show using dressing
transformations how to extend, in a way which is compatible with the
hamiltonian structure, the SBKP_2-hierarchy by odd flows, as well as the
equivalence of this extended hierarchy to the SBKP-hierarchy of Manin-Radul.
