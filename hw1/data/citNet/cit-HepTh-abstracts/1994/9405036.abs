  We introduce the Wigner functional representing a quantum field in terms of
the field amplitudes and their conjugate momenta. The equation of motion for
the functional of a scalar field point out the relevance of solutions of the
classical field equations to the time evolution of the quantum field. We
discuss the field in thermodynamical equilibrium and find the explicit solution
of the equations of motion for the so-called ``roll-over'' phase transition.
Finally, we briefly discuss the approximate methods for the evaluation of the
Wigner functional that may be used to numerically simulate the initial value
problem..
