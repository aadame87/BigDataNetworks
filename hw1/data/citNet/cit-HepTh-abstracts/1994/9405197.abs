  The ground state of the $\SO(2n)_{1} \times \SO(2n)_{1} \over \SO(2n)_{2}$
coset theories, perturbed by the $\phi^{id,id}_{adj}$ operator and those of the
sine-Gordon theory, for special values of the coupling constant in the
attracting regime, is the same. In the first part of this paper we extend these
results to the $\SO(2n-1)$ cases. In the second part, we analyze the Algebraic
Bethe Ansatz procedure for special points in the repulsive region. We find a
one-to-one ``duality'' correspondence between these theories and those studied
in the first part of the paper. We use the gluing procedure at the massive node
proposed by Fendley and Intriligator in order to obtain the TBA systems for the
generalized parafermionic supersymmetric sine-Gordon model. In the third part
we propose the TBA equations for the whole class of perturbed coset models $G_k
\times G_l \over G_{k+l}$ with the operator $\phi^{id,id}_{adj}$ and $G$ a
non-simply-laced group generated by one of the $\G_2,\F_4,\B_n,\C_n$ algebras.
