  We investigate the coupled system of gravity and a scalar with exponential
potential. The energy momentum tensor of the scalar field induces a
time-dependent cosmological ``constant''. This adjusts itself dynamically to
become in the ``late'' universe (including today) proportional to the energy
density of matter and radiation. Possible consequences for the present
cosmology are shortly discussed. We also address the question of naturalness of
the cosmon model.
