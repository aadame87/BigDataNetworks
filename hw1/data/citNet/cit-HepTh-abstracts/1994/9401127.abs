  All possible graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $SL(2)$
are described. We prove that differential Poisson-Lie structures prolonging the
Sklyanin brackets do not exist on $SL(2)$. There are two and only two graded
Poisson-Lie structures on $SL (2)$ and neither of them can be obtained by a
reduction of graded Poisson-Lie structures on the external algebra of $GL(2)$.
Both of them can be quantized and as a result we get a new graded algebra of
quantum right-invariant forms on $SL_q(2)$ with three generators.
