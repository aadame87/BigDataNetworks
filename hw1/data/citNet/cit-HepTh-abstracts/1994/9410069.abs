  We study the effect of S-duality and target-space duality tranformations of
$N=4,d=4$ and $N=1,d=10$ supersymmetric configurations on their Killing
spinors. We find that, under reasonable assumptions, the dual configurations
are also supersymmetric and that the Killing spinors transform in a simple way.
