Title: A Global Analog of Cheshire Charge
Authors: Patrick McGraw
Comments: 24 pages (figures 1-4 included as uu-encoded tar files), CALT-68-1865
  (Revised version: an expression (eq. 17) for global charge density is
  corrected; some typos and sign mismatches are removed.)
Journal-ref: Phys.Rev. D50 (1994) 952-961
\\
  It is shown that a model with a spontaneously broken global symmetry can
support defects analogous to Alice strings, and a process analogous to Cheshire
charge exchange can take place. A possible realization in superfluid He-3 is
pointed out.
