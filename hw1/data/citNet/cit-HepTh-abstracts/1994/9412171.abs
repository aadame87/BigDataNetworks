  Reducible off-shell anomalous gauge theories are studied in the framework of
an extended Field-Antifield formalism by introducing new variables associated
with the anomalous gauge degrees of freedom. The Wess-Zumino term for these
theories is constructed and new gauge invariances appear. The quantum effects
due to the extra variables are considered.
