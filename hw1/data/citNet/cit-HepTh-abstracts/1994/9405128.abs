Title: Spectral Representation of Correlation Functions in two-dimensional
  Quantum Field Theories
Authors: G. Mussardo
Comments: 9 pages, ISAS/60/94/EP
\\
  The non-perturbative mapping between different Quantum Field Theories and
other features of two-dimensional massive integrable models are discussed by
using the Form Factor approach. The computation of ultraviolet data associated
to the massive regime is illustrated by taking as an example the scattering
theory of the Ising Model with boundary.
