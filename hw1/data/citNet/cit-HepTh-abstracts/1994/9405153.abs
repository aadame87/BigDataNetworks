  We show that Galois theory of cyclotomic number fields provides a powerful
tool to construct systematically integer-valued matrices commuting with the
modular matrix S, as well as automorphisms of the fusion rules. Both of these
prescriptions allow the construction of modular invariants and offer new
insight in the structure of known exceptional invariants.
