  The Hamiltonian actions for extreme and non-extreme black holes are compared
and contrasted and a simple derivation of the lack of entropy of extreme black
holes is given. In the non-extreme case the wave function of the black hole
depends on horizon degrees of freedom which give rise to the entropy. Those
additional degrees of freedom are absent in the extreme case.
