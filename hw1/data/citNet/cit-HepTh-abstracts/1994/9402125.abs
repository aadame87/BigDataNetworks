  Susskind has recently shown that a relativistic string approaching the event
horizon of a black hole spreads in both the transverse and longitudinal
directions in the reference frame of an outside observer. The transverse
spreading can be described as a branching diffusion of wee string bits. This
stochastic process provides a mechanism for thermalizing the quantum state of
the string as it spreads across the stretched horizon.
