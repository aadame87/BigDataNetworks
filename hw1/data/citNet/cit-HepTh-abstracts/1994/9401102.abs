  We study black hole formation in a model of two dimensional dilaton gravity
and 24 massless scalar fields with a boundary. We find the most general
boundary condition consistent with perfect reflection of matter and the
constraints. We show that in the semiclassical approximation and for the
generic value of the parameter which characterizes the boundary conditions, the
boundary starts receeding to infinity at the speed of light whenever the total
energy of the incoming matter flux exceeds a certain critical value. This is
also the critical energy which marks the onset of black hole formation. We then
compute the quantum fluctuations of the boundary and of the rescaled scalar
curvature and show that as soon as the incoming energy exceeds this critical
value, an asymptotic observer using normal time resolutions will always measure
large fluctuations of space-time near the horizon, even though the freely
falling observer does not. This is an aspect of black hole complementarity
relating directly the quantum gravity effects.
