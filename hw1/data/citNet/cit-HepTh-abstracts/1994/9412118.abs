  A brief heuristic explanation is given of recent work with Juergen Fuchs,
Beatriz Gato-Rivera and Christoph Schweigert on the construction of modular
invariant partition functions from Galois symmetry in conformal field theory. A
generalization, which we call quasi-Galois symmetry, is also described. As an
application of the latter, the invariants of the exceptional algebras at level
$g$ (for example $E_8$ level 30) expected from conformal embeddings are
presented. [Contribution to the Proceedings of the International Symposium on
