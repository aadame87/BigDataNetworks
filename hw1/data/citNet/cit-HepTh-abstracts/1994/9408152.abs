  Based upon a first principle, the generalized gauge principle, we construct a
general model with $G_L\times G'_R \times Z_2$ gauge symmetry, where
$Z_2=\pi_4(G_L)$ is the fourth homotopy group of the gauge group $G_L$, by
means of the non-commutative differential geometry and reformulate the
Weinberg-Salam model and the standard model with the Higgs field being a gauge
field on the fourth homotopy group of their gauge groups. We show that in this
approach not only the Higgs field is automatically introduced on the equal
footing with ordinary Yang-Mills gauge potentials and there are no extra
constraints among the parameters at the tree level but also it most importantly
is stable against quantum correlation.
