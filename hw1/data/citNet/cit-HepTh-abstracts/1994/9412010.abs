  In this paper we calculate the massive particle creation as seen by a
stationary observer in a $1+1$ dimensional spacetime compact in space. The
Bogolubov transformation relating the annihilation and creation operators
between two spacelike surfaces is calculated. The particle creation, as
observed by a stationary observer who moves from the first spacelike surface to
the second is then calculated, and shown to be finite, as is expected for a
spacetime with finite spatial volume.
