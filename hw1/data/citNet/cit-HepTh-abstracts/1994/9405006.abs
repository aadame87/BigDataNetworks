  As was shown by Leutwyler and Smilga, the fact that chiral symmetry is broken
and the existence of a effective finite volume partition function leads to an
infinite number of sum rules for the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator in QCD.
In this paper we argue these constraints, together with universality arguments
from quantum chaos and universal conductance fluctuations, completely determine
its spectrum near zero virtuality. As in the classical random matrix ensembles,
we find three universality classes, depedending on whether the color
representation of the gauge group is pseudo-real, complex or real. They
correspond to $SU(2)$ with fundamental fermions, $SU(N_c)$, $N_c \ge 3$, with
fundamental fermions, and $SU(N_c)$, $N_c \ge 3$, with adjoint fermions,
respectively.}
