  We construct the action-angle variables of a classical integrable model
defined on complex projective phase space and calculate the quantum mechanical
propagator in the coherent state path integral representation using the
stationary phase approximation. We show that the resulting expression for the
propagator coincides with the exact propagator which was obtained by solving
the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation.
