  The BRST quantisation of the Drinfeld - Sokolov reduction applied to the case
of $A^{(1)}_2\,$ is explored to construct in an unified and systematic way the
general singular vectors in ${\cal W}_3$ and ${\cal W}_3^{(2)}$ Verma modules.
The construction relies on the use of proper quantum analogues of the classical
DS gauge fixing transformations. Furthermore the stability groups $\overline
W^{(\eta)}\,$ of the highest weights of the ${\cal W}\,$ - Verma modules play
an important role in the proof of the BRST equivalence of the
Malikov-Feigin-Fuks singular vectors and the ${\cal W}$ algebra ones. The
resulting singular vectors are essentially classified by the affine Weyl group
$W\, $ modulo $\overline W^{(\eta)}\,$. This is a detailed presentation of the
results announced in a recent paper of the authors (Phys. Lett. B318 (1993)
85).
