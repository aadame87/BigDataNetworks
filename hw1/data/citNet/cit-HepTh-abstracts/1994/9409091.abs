  We use the metric on the space of gravity fields given by DeWitt to construct
a unique kinematic measure on the space of FRW simple fluids and show that when
the mass parameter $\Omega$ is used as a coordinate this measure is singular at
$\Omega = 1$. This singularity, combined with the time evolution of $\Omega$,
distorts distributions of $\Omega$ values to be concentrated in the
neighborhood of 1 at early times. It is a distorted distribution of $\Omega$
values that sometimes misleads the casual observer to conclude that $\Omega$
must be exactly equal to 1.
