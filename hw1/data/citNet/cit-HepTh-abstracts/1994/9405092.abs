\\
  We present a classical integrable model of $SU(N)$ isospin defined on complex
projective phase space in the external magnetic field and solve it exactly by
constructing the action-angle variables for the system. We quantize the system
using the coherent state path integral method and obtain an exact expression
for quantum mechanical propagator by solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equations.
