Title: Difference-elliptic operators and root systems

  Recently a new technique in the harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces was
suggested based on certain remarkable representations of affine and double
affine Hecke algebras in terms of Dunkl and Demazure operators instead of Lie
groups and Lie algebras. In the classic case it resulted (among other
applications) in a new theory of radial part of Laplace operators and their
deformations including a related concept of the Fourier transform.
  In the present paper we demonstrate that the new technique works well even in
the most general difference-elliptic case conjecturally corresponding to the
$q$-Kac-Moody algebras. We discuss here only the construction of the
generalized radial (zonal) Laplace operators and connect them with the
difference-elliptic Ruijsenaars operators generalizing in its turn the
Olshanetsky-Perelomov differential elliptic operators.
