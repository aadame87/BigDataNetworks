    We use the Chern-Simons quantum field theory in order to prove
a recently conjectured limitation on the 1/K expansion of the Jones
polynomial of a knot and its relation to the Alexander polynomial.
This limitation allows us to derive a surgery formula for the loop
corrections to the contribution of the trivial connection to Witten's
invariant. The 2-loop part of this formula coincides with Walker's
surgery formula for Casson-Walker invariant. This proves a conjecture
that Casson-Walker invariant is a 2-loop correction to the trivial
connection contribution to Witten's invariant of a rational homology
sphere. A contribution of the trivial connection to Witten's invariant
of a manifold with nontrivial rational homology is calculated for the case
of Seifert manifolds.
