  The Yangian symmetry Y(su($n$)) of the Calogero-Sutherland-Moser spin model
is reconsidered. The Yangian generators are constructed from two non-commuting
su($n$)-loop algebras. The latters generate an infinite dimensional symmetry
algebra which is a deformation of the $W_\infty$-algebra. We show that this
deformed $W_\infty$-algebra contains an infinite number of Yangian subalgebras
with different deformation parameters.
