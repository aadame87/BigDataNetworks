  We present an extension of ``smooth bosonization'' to the non-Abelian case.
We construct an enlarged theory containing both bosonic and fermionic fields
which exhibits a local chiral gauge symmetry. A gauge fixing function depending
on one real parameter allows us to interpolate smoothly between a purely
fermionic and a purely bosonic representation. The procedure is, in the special
case of bosonization, complementary to the approach based on duality.
