  An analysis of the state space in the BRST--quantization in the Schroedinger
representation is performed on the basis of the results obtained earlier in the
framework of the Fock space representation. It is shown that to get
satisfactory results it is necessary to have from the very beginning a
meaningful definition of the total state space.
