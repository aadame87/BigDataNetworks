  A set of integral relations for rotational and translational zero modes in
the vicinity of the soliton solution are derived from the particle-like
properties of the latter and verified for a number of models (solitons in
1+1-dimensions, skyrmeons in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions, non-abelian monopoles).
It is shown, that by consistent quantization within the framework of collective
coordinates these relations ensure the correct diagonal expressions for the
kinetic and centrifugal terms in the Hamiltonian in the lowest orders of the
perturbation expansion. The connection between these properties and virial
relations is also determined.
