  The 2D model of gravity with zweibeins $e^{a}$ and the Lorentz connection
one-form $\omega^{a}_{\ b}$ as independent gravitational variables coupled to
2d massless Dirac matter is considered. It is shown that the classical
equations of motion are exactly integrated in the case of chiral fermions.
