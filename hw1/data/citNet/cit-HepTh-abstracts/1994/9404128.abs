  We analyze the analytic continuation of the formally divergent one-loop
amplitude for scattering of the graviton multiplet in the Type II Superstring.
In particular we obtain explicit double and single dispersion relations,
formulas for all the successive branch cuts extending out to plus infinity, as
well as for the decay rate of a massive string state of arbitrary mass 2N into
two string states of lower mass. We compare our results with the box diagram in
a superposition of $\phi^3$-like field theories. The stringy effects are traced
to a convergence problem in this superposition.
