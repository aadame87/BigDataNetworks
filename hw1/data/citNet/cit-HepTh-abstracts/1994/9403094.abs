  An elliptic deformation of $\widehat{sl}_2$ is proposed. Our presentation of
the algebra is based on the relation $RLL=LLR^*$, where $R$ and $R^*$ are
eight-vertex $R$-matrices with the elliptic moduli chosen differently. In the
trigonometric limit, this algebra reduces to a quotient of that proposed by
Reshetikhin and Semenov-Tian-Shansky. Conjectures concerning highest weight
modules and vertex operators are formulated, and the physical interpretation of
$R^*$ is discussed.
