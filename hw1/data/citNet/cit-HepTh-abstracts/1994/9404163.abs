  We introduce a model detector which registers the passage of a particle
through the detector location, without substantially perturbing the particle
wave function. (The exact time of passage is not determined in such
measurements.) We then show that our detector can operate in a classically
forbidden region and register particles passing through a certain point under a
potential barrier. We show that it should be possible to observe the particle's
track under the barrier.
