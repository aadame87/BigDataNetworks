  We present a method for extracting effective Lagrangians from QCD. The
resulting effective Lagrangians are based on exact rewrites of cut-off QCD in
terms of these new collective field degrees of freedom. These cut-off
Lagrangians are thus ``effective'' in the sense that they explicitly contain
some of the physical long-distance degrees of freedom from the outset. As an
example we discuss the introduction of a new collective field carrying the
quantum numbers of the $\eta'$-meson. (Contribution presented by R. Sollacher
at the workshop ``QCD'94'', Montpellier, France, July 7-13, 1994. To appear in
those proceedings.)
