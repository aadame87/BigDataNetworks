  Extreme 4-dimensional dilaton black holes embedded into 10-dimensional
geometry are shown to be dual to the gravitational waves in string theory. The
corresponding gravitational waves are the generalization of pp-fronted waves,
called supersymmetric string waves. They are given by Brinkmann metric and the
two-form field, without a dilaton. The non-diagonal part of the metric of the
dual partner of the wave together with the two-form field correspond to the
vector field in 4-dimensional geometry of the charged extreme black holes.
