  We review recent results which clarify the role of the integrable many-body
problems in the quantum field theory framework.They describe the dynamics of
the topological degrees of freedom in the theories which are obtained by
perturbing the topological ones by the proper Hamiltonians and sources.
Interpretation of the many-body dynamics as a motion on the different moduli
spaces as well as the property of duality is discussed.Tower of many-body
systems can be derived from a tower of the field theories with appropriate
phase spaces which have a transparent interpretation in terms of the group
theory.The appearance of Calogero-type systems in different physical phenomena
is mentioned.
