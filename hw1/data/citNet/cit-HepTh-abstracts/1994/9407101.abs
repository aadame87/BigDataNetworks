  An inflationary epoch driven by the kinetic energy density in a dynamical
Planck mass is studied. In the conformally related Einstein frame it is easiest
to see the demands of successful inflation cannot be satisfied by kinetic
inflation alone. Viewed in the original Jordan-Brans-Dicke frame, the obstacle
is manifest as a kind of graceful exit problem and/or a kind of flatness
problem. These arguments indicate the weakness of only the simplest
formulation. {}From them can be gleaned directions toward successful kinetic
inflation.
