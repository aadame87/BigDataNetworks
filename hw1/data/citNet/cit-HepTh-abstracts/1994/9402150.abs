  constant by quantum effects

\\
  In the framework of the recently proposed asymptotically finite gauge models
the cosmological constant is essentially weakened by quantum effects. The next
(and more general) claim is that the coupling between quantum fields may
suppress their contributions to the induced cosmological constant.
