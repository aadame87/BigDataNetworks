Title: The question of anomalies in the Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter
  fields

  We study the Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter field by means of an
effective Lagrangian obtained from the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism. We
show that there is no rotational anomaly for any proper gauge we choose.
