Title: On dispersionless Hirota type equations
Author: Robert Carroll (Mathematics Dept., University of Illinois, Urbana, IL)
Comments: 10 pages, latex (need only run once)
\\
  Dispersionless Hirota type equations are extracted from the dispersionless
limit of the Fay differential identity due to Takasaki- Takebe. A few other
results are sketched between inverse scattering, dKdV, and gravity.
