  We construct a class of representations of the quadratic R-matrix algebra,
given by the reflection equation with the spectral parameter, in terms of
certain ordinary difference operators. These operators turn out to act as
parameter shifting operators on the 3_F_2(1) hypergeometric function and its
limit cases and on classical orthogonal polynomials. The relationship with the
factorization method will be discussed.
