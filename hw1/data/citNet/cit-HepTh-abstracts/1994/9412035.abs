  This paper is devoted to the study of closed string field theory in two
dimensions. We compare two different approaches: BRST closed string field
theory and the string effective Lagrangian. We show that the quadratic action
and the pole structures of tree-level scattering amplitudes agree. We study
merits and drawbacks of various gauge fixing procedures. In particular, we
discuss conformal gauge in the context of the effective Lagrangian, and Siegel
and Lorentz-like gauge in the general BRST approach. We discuss the ways in
which discrete states survive a particular gauge fixing both by directly
solving the equations of motion, and by analyzing pole structure of the
scattering amplitudes.
