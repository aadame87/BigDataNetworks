  By exploiting standard facts about $N=1$ and $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory, the Donaldson invariants of four-manifolds that admit a Kahler metric
can be computed. The results are in agreement with available mathematical
computations, and provide a powerful check on the standard claims about
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
