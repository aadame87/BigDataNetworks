Title: Barriers in Quantum Gravity
Authors: Jan Ambjorn
Comments: standard latex, 10 pages. (one year old contribution to Trieste
  workshop, but continued demand for preprints has motivated me to put it on
  the bulletin board), NBI-HE-93-31
\\
  I discuss recent progress in our understanding of two barriers in quantum
gravity: $c > 1$ in the case of 2d quantum gravity and $D > 2$ in the case of
Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert gravity formulated in space-time dimensions $D >2$.
