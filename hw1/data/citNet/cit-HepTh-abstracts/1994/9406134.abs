  Mass independent renormalization group functions in massive theories are
related to normalization properties of the Green functions in the asymptotic
region, where mass effects are neglected. In this special form the
renormalization group invariance is restricted to the asymptotic region and
consequently mass effects cannot be recoverd by a integration of the
renormalziation group equation. It is shown, that mass independence results in
the limit of a large normalization point, whenever a Callan-Symanzik equation
exists and contains the same differential operators as the renormalization
group equation.
