Title: Geometry of Fermionic Constraints in Superstring Theories
Authors: Dmitrij Sorokin
Comments: 7 pages, preprint KCL-TH-94-9
\\
  Considered are superparticle and superstring models invariant under
supersymmetry in a target superspace and local extended worldsheet
supersymmetry the latter replacing the fermionic $\kappa$--symmetry of the
conventional Green--Schwarz formulations. (Talk given at the Conference on
Geometry of Constrained Dynamical Systems,
  Cambridge, June 15-18, 1994).
