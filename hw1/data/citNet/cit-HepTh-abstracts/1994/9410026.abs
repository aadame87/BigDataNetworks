  The possible boundary conditions consistent with the integrability of the
classical sine-Gordon equation are studied. A boundary value problem on the
half-line $x\leq 0$ with local boundary condition at the origin is considered.
The most general form of this boundary condition is found such that the problem
be integrable. For the resulting system an infinite number of involutive
integrals of motion exist. These integrals are calculated and one is identified
as the Hamiltonian. The results found agree with some recent work of Ghoshal
and Zamolodchikov.
