Authors: Miroslav Doresic,Stjepan Meljanac and Marijan Milekovic
Comments: 12 pages, RBI-TH-2/94, LATEX
\\
  We define a class of deformed multimode oscillator algebras which possess
number operators and can be mapped to multimode Bose algebra.We construct and
discuss the states in the Fock space and the corresponding number operators.
