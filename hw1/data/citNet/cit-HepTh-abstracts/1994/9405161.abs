  The structure and properties of possible $q$-Minkowski spaces is discussed,
and the corresponding non-commutative differential calculi are developed in
detail and compared with already existing proposals. This is done by stressing
its covariance properties as described by appropriate reflection equations.
Some isomorphisms among the space-time and derivative algebras are
demonstrated, and their representations are described briefly. Finally, some
physical consequences and open problems are discussed.
