  Setting an ansats that the metric is expressible by a power series of the
inverse radius and taking a particular gauge choice, we construct a "general
solution" of (2+1)-dimensional Einstein's equations with a negative
cosmological constant in the case where the spacetime is asymptotically anti-de
Sitter. Our general solution turns out to be parametrized by two centrally
extended quadratic differentials on $S^{1}$. In order to include 3-dimensional
Black Holes naturally into our general solution, it is necessary to exclude the
region inside the horizon. We also discuss the relation of our general solution
to the moduli space of flat $\tilde{SL}(2,R)\times\tilde{SL}(2,R)$ connections.
