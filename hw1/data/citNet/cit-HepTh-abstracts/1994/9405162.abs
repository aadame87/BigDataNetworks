  Black hole entropy is studied for an exactly solvable model of
two-dimensional gravity\cite{rst1}, using recently developed Noether charge
techniques\cite{wald1}. This latter approach is extended to accomodate the
non-local form of the semiclassical effective action. In the two-dimensional
model, the final black hole entropy can be expressed as a local quantity
evaluated on the horizon. This entropy is shown to satisfy an increase theorem
on either the global or apparent horizon of a two-dimensional black hole.
