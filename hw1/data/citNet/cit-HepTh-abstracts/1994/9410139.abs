  { This letter discusses the BRST cohomology of superparticles type I and II.
It was used an extended super-space to construct $S0(9,1)$ superparticle
actions that lead to super-wave functions whose spinor components satisfy
$S0(9,1)$ covariant constraints. Their BRST charges were found by using BV
methods, since the models present a large number of symmetries and only close
on-shell. It is shown that the zero ghost-number cohomology class of both
models reproduce the same spectrum as that of N=1 ten dimensional
super-Yang-Mills theory. }
