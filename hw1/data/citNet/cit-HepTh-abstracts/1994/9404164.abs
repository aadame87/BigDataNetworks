  One of the interesting features about field theories in odd dimensions is the
induction of parity violating terms and well-defined {\em finite} topological
actions via quantum loops if a fermion mass term is originally present and
conversely. Aspects of this issue are illustrated for electrodynamics in 2+1
and 4+1 dimensions. (3 uuencoded Postscript Files are appended at the end of
