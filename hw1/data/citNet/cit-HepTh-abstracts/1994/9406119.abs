  We consider a massive fermion interacting with a U(1) gauge field in the
limit of a large coupling constant. It is found that the current has a
generalized London term that can originate massive excitations for two of the
three components of the gauge field, which disappear for a free particle at
rest. The origin of the superconductive term is due to a partial breaking of
the gauge symmetry in the limit of a large coupling constant. Beside, the
scalar potential generated by the particle, the only component of the gauge
field that keeps gauge invariance, increases with the square of the distance.
These results should give a path towards the derivation of quark confinement
from QCD.
