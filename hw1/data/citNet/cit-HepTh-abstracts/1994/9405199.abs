  We review the insights into black hole entropy that arise from the
formulation of gravitation theory in terms of dimensional continuation. The
role of the horizon area and the deficit angle of a conical singularity at the
horizon as canonically conjugate dynamical variables is analyzed. The path
integral and the extension of the Wheeler-De Witt equation for black holes are
discussed.
