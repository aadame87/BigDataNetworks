  The cyclic evolutions and associated geometric phases induced by
time-independent Hamiltonians are studied for the case when the evolution
operator becomes the identity (those processes are called {\it evolution
loops}). We make a detailed treatment of systems having equally-spaced energy
levels. Special emphasis is made on the potentials which have the same spectrum
as the harmonic oscillator potential (the generalized oscillator potentials)
and on their recently found coherent states.
