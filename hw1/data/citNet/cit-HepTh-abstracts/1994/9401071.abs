  It is shown that in the Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) theory, as well as in the
pure flat space Yang-Mills (YM) theory, there always exists an opportunity to
pass over the potential barrier separating homotopically distinct vacuum
sectors, because the barrier height may be arbitrarily small. However, at low
energies all the overbarrier histories are suppressed by the destructive
interference. In the pure YM theory the situation remains the same for any
energies. In the EYM theory on the other hand, when the energy is large and
exceeds the ground state EYM sphaleron mass, the constructive interference
occurs instead. This means that in the extreme high energy limit the
exponential suppression of the fermion number violation in pure YM theory is
removed due to gravitational effects.
