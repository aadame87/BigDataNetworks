  The previous discussion \cite{ezawa} on reducing the phase space of the first
order Einstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions is reconsidered. We construct a \lq\lq
correct" physical phase space in the case of positive cosmological constant,
taking into account the geometrical feature of SO(3,1) connections. A
parametrization which unifies the two sectors of the physical phase space is
also given.
