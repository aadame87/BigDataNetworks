Title: Models of Quantum Space Time: Quantum Field Planes
Authors: G. Mack, V. Schomerus
Comments: 21 pages, HUTMP 94-B335
\\
  Quantum field planes furnish a noncommutative differential algebra $\Omega$
which substitutes for the commutative algebra of functions and forms on a
contractible manifold. The data required in their construction come from a
quantum field theory. The basic idea is to replace the ground field ${\bf C}$
of quantum planes by the noncommutative algebra ${\cal A}$ of observables of
the quantum field theory.
