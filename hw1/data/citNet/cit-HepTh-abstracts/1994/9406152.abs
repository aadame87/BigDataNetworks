  The dual version of the D=10 N=1 supergravity (SUGRA) is considered in the
superspace approach. The superstring (anomaly compensating) corrections are
described by the 3-form superfield $A_{abc}$ . The complete set of dynamical
equations for the $A$-field and for physical fields of the theory are
presented. The solution of the $A$-field equations as a finite order polynomial
in terms of curvature and graviphoton superfields is given. It makes possible
to incorporate some of the superstring corrections in the dual supergravity in
the explicit, supersymmetric and closed form.
