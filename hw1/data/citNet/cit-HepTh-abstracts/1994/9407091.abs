  We consider a model of 2D gravity with the coefficient of the
Einstein-Hilbert action having an imaginary part $\pi/2$. This is equivalent to
introduce a $\Theta$-vacuum structure in the genus expansion whose effect is to
convert the expansion into a series of alternating signs, presumably Borel
summable. We show that the specific heat of the model has a physical behaviour.
It can be represented nonperturbatively as a series in terms of integrals over
moduli spaces of punctured spheres and the sum of the series can be rewritten
as a unique integral over a suitable moduli space of infinitely punctured
spheres. This is an explicit realization \`a la Friedan-Shenker of 2D quantum
gravity. We conjecture that the expansion in terms of punctures and the genus
expansion can be derived using the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem. We briefly
analyze expansions in terms of punctured spheres also for multicritical models.
