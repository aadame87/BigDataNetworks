  Using a representation of the q-deformed Lorentz algebra as differential
operators on quantum Minkowski space, we define an algebra of observables for a
q-deformed relativistic quantum mechanics with spin zero. We construct a
Hilbert space representation of this algebra in which the square of the mass $
p^2 $ is diagonal.
