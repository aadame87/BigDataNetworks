  Photon distribution function, means and dispersions are found explicitly for
the nonclassical state of light which is created from the photon--added
coherent state $\vert \alpha,m \rangle$ due to a time--dependence of the
frequency of the electromagnetic field oscillator. Generating function for
factorial momenta is obtained. The Wigner function and Q--function are
constructed explicitly for the excited photon--added coherent state of light.
Influence of added photons on known oscillations of photon distribution
function for squeezed light is demonstrated. oscillator are considered.
