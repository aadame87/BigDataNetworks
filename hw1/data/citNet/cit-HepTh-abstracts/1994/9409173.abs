  A test on the numerical accuracy of the semiclassical approximation as a
function of the principal quantum number has been performed for the
Pullen--Edmonds model, a two--dimensional, non--integrable, scaling invariant
perturbation of the resonant harmonic oscillator. A perturbative interpretation
is obtained of the recently observed phenomenon of the accuracy decrease on the
approximation of individual energy levels at the increase of the principal
quantum number. Moreover, the accuracy provided by the semiclassical
approximation formula is on the average the same as that provided by quantum
perturbation theory.
