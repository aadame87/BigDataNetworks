  We consider two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories with a generic
exponential potential for the dilaton, and obtain the most general black hole
solutions in the Schwarzshild form. We discuss their geometrical and
thermodynamical properties. We also study these models from the point of view
of gauge theories of the extended Poincar\'e group and show that they can be
considered as gauge theories with broken symmetry. Finally, we examine the
theory in a hamiltonian formalism and discuss its quantization and its
symmetries.
