Title: Nambu mass hierarchies in low energy string models

  This paper explores a recent idea of Nambu to generate hierarchies among
Yukawa couplings in the context of effective supergravity and superstrings
models. The Yukawa couplings are homogeneous functions of the moduli and a
geometrical constraint between them with a crucial role in the Nambu mechanism
is found in a class of models of no-scale type. The Yukawas are dynamical
variables at low energy to be determined by a minimization process. (Based on
the talk given at ICHEP94, Glasgow, july 1994)
