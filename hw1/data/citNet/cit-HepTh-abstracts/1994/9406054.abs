  We present the new extended supersymmetrization of the
  Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation by introducing two superbosons fields with the
different gradation. Our model is different from this considered by Toppan and
in the reduced case (nonextended supersymmetry) is also different from this
considered by Kulish and Roelofs and Kersten. We prove that our model is
integrable by presenting its Lax formulation.
