  We present fermionic sum representations of the characters
$\chi^{(p,p')}_{r,s}$ of the minimal $M(p,p')$ models for all relatively prime
integers $p'>p$ for some allowed values of $r$ and $s$. Our starting point is
binomial (q-binomial) identities derived from a truncation of the state
counting equations of the XXZ spin ${1\over 2}$ chain of anisotropy
$-\Delta=-\cos(\pi{p\over p'})$. We use the Takahashi-Suzuki method to express
the allowed values of $r$ (and $s$) in terms of the continued fraction
decomposition of $\{{p'\over p}\}$ (and ${p\over p'}$) where $\{x\}$ stands for
the fractional part of $x.$ These values are, in fact, the dimensions of the
hermitian irreducible representations of $SU_{q_{-}}(2)$ (and $SU_{q_{+}}(2)$)
with $q_{-}=\exp (i \pi \{{p'\over p}\})$ (and $q_{+}=\exp ( i \pi {p\over
p'})).$ We also establish the duality relation $M(p,p')\leftrightarrow
M(p'-p,p')$ and discuss the action of the Andrews-Bailey transformation in the
space of minimal models. Many new identities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type are
presented.
