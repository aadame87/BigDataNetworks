  In this letter I study the universality of the nonperturbative effects and
the vacua structure of the stochastic stabilization of the matrix models which
defines Pure 2D Quantum Gravity. I show also that there is not tunneling, in
the continuum limit, between the one-arc and three-arc solutions of the
simplest matrix model which defines the flow between Pure Gravity and the
Lee-Yang model.
