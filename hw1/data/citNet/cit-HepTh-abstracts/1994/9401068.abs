  We calculate the Riemann curvature tensor and sectional curvature for the Lie
group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the Klein bottle and projective
plane. In particular, we investigate the sign of the sectional curvature, and
find a possible disagreement with a theorem of Lukatskii. We suggest an
amendment to this theorem.
