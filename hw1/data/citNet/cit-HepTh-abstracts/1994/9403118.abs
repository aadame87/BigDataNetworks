\\
  A general method for the construction of solutions of the d'Alambertian and
double d'Alambertian (harmonic and bi-harmonic) equations with local dependence
of arbitrary functions upon two independent arguments is proposed. The
connection between solutions of this kind and self-dual configurations of gauge
fields having no singularities is established.
