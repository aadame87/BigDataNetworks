  We analyse statistical system with interface energy proportional to the
length of the edges of interface. We have found the dual system high
temperature expansion of which equally well generates surfaces with linear
amplitude. These dual systems are in the same relation as 3D Ising ferromagnet
to the 3D Gauge spin system.
