  The symmetries associated with the closed bosonic string partition function
are examined so that the integration region in Teichmuller space can be
determined. The conditions on the period matrix defining the fundamental region
can be translated to relations on the parameters of the uniformizing Schottky
group. The growth of the lower bound for the regularized partition function is
derived through integration over a subset of the fundamental region.
