  A scheme suitable for describing quantum nonultralocal models including
supersymmetric ones is proposed. Braided algebras are generalised to be used
through Baxterisation for constructing braided quantum Yang--Baxter equations.
  Supersymmetric and some known nonultralocal models are derived in the
framework of the present approach.
