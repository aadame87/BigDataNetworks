Title: Lectures on Mirror Symmetry
Authors: S. Hosono, A. Klemm and S. Theisen

  We give an introduction to mirror symmetry of strings on Calabi-Yau manifolds
with an emphasis on its applications e.g. for the computation of Yukawa
couplings. We introduce all necessary concepts and tools such as the basics of
toric geometry, resolution of singularities, construction of mirror pairs,
Picard-Fuchs equations, etc. and illustrate all of this on a non-trivial
example. Extended version of a lecture given at the Third Baltic Student
Seminar, Helsinki September 1993
