  We present a general method to bosonize systems of Fermions with infinitely
many degrees of freedom, in particular systems of non-relativistic electrons at
positive density, by expressing the quantized conserved electric charge- and
current density in terms of a bosonic antisymmetric tensorfield of a rank d--1,
where d is the dimension of space. This enables us to make concepts and tools
from gauge theory available for the purpose of analyzing electronic structure
of non-relativistic matter. We apply our bosonization identities and concepts
from gauge theory, such as Wegner -'t Hooft duality, to a variety of systems of
condensed matter physics: Landau-Fermi liquids, Hall fluids, London
superconductors, etc.. Among our results are an exact formula for the plasmon
gap in a metal, a simple derivation of the Anderson-Higgs mechanism in
superconductors, and an analysis of the orthogonality catastrophe for static
sources.
