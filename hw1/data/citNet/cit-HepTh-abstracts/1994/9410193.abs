  The Hoft structure of the central extension of the $U_q \left(
\widehat{sl\left( n \right) }\right)$ algebra is considered. The intertwine
matrix induces new integrable spin chain models. We show the relation of these
models and the biparametric spin chain $\widehat{sl_{p,q} \left( n \right)}$
models. The cases $n=2$ are $n=3$ are discussed and for $n=2$ we obtain the
model of Dasgupta and Chowdhury . The case $n=3$ is solved with nested Bethe
ansatz method and it is showed the dependence of the Bethe equations in the
second parameter introduced
