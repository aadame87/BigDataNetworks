Title: On Classification of Deformations of the Gardner Bracket Over Local
  Infinitesimal Transformations
Authors: V.L.Vereschagin
Comments: 3 pp, Latex
\\
  The Lie algebra specified by space of local functionals with commutator
determined by the Gardner bracket was under survey. Problem of classification
of deformations of this bracket over local infinitesimal transformations of
functionals was interpreted as a problem of computing the appropriate
cohomology group of order 2. The most interesting class of deformations was
investigated.
