  The stochastic quantization of dissipative systems is discussed. It is shown
that in order to stochastically quantize a system with dissipation, one has to
restrict the Fourier transform of the space-time variable to the positive half
domain in the complex plane. This breaks the time-reversal invariance, which
manifests in the formulation through the resulting noninvariant forms for the
propagators. The relation of the stochastic approach with the Caldeira and
Leggett path-integral method is also analyzed.
