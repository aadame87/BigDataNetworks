  An accelerating observer sees a thermal bath of radiation at the Hawking
temperature which is proportional to the acceleration. Also, in string theory
there is a Hagedorn temperature beyond which one cannot go without an infinite
amount of energy. Several authors have shown that in the context of Hawking
radiation a limiting temperature for string theory leads to a limiting
acceleration, which for a black hole implies a minimum distance from the
horizon for an observer to remain stationary. We argue that this effectively
introduces a cutoff in Rindler space or the Schwarzschild geometry inside of
which accelerations would exceed this maximum value. Furthermore, this natural
cutoff in turn allows one to define a finite entropy for Rindler space or a
black hole as all divergences were occurring on the horizon. In all cases if a
particular relationship exists between Newton's constant and the string tension
then the entropy of the string modes agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking
formula.
