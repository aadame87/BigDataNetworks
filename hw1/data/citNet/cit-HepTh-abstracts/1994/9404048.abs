  We study scattering processes on $p$-adic multiloop surfaces represented as
multiloop infinite graphs with total valence in each vertex equal $p+1$. They
all are spaces of the constant negative curvature since they are quotients of
the $p$-adic hyperbolic plane over free acting discrete subgroup of $PGL(2,
{\bf Q}_p)$. Releasing the closed part of this graph containing all loops which
is called reduced graph $T_{red}$ we can obtain $L$-function corresponding to
this closed graph. For the total graph we introduce the notion of the spherical
functions being eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator acting on the graph and
consider $s$--wave scattering processes therefore defining scattering matrices
$c_i$. The number of possibilities coincides with $|\T_{red}|$ --- the number
of vertices of the reduced graph. Taking the product over all $c_i$ we define
the total scattering matrix which appears to be essentially presented as a
ratio of $L$--functions: $C\sim L(\alpha_+)/L(\alpha_-)$, where the function
$L$ itself depends only on the shape of $\Tr$ and not on the initial infinite
graph, and the only dependence of initial $p$ is contained in arguments
$\alpha_\pm$ defined by $p$ and eigenvalue $t$ of the Laplacian. We also
present a proof by H.Bass of the theorem expressing $L$--functions on arbitrary
finite graphs via determinants of some local operators on these graphs.
