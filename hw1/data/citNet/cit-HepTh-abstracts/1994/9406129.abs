  A gauge invariant notion of a strong connection is presented and
characterized. It is then used to justify the way in which a global curvature
form is defined. Strong connections are interpreted as those that are induced
from the base space of a quantum bundle. Examples of both strong and non-strong
connections are provided. In particular, such connections are constructed on a
quantum deformation of the fibration $S^2 -> RP^2$. A certain class of strong
$U_q(2)$-connections on a trivial quantum principal bundle is shown to be
equivalent to the class of connections on a free module that are compatible
with the q-dependent hermitian metric. A particular form of the Yang-Mills
action on a trivial $U\sb q(2)$-bundle is investigated. It is proved to
coincide with the Yang-Mills action constructed by A.Connes and M.Rieffel.
Furthermore, it is shown that the moduli space of critical points of this
action functional is independent of q.
