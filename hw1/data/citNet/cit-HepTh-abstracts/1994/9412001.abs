  The upper bound for asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of expansion of
the evolution operator kernel in powers of the time interval $\Dt$ was
obtained. It is found that for the nonpolynomial potentials the coefficients
may increase as $n!$. But increasing may be more slow if the contributions with
opposite signs cancel each other. Particularly, it is not excluded that for
number of the potentials the expansion is convergent. For the polynomial
potentials $\Dt$-expansion is certainly asymptotic one. The coefficients
increase in this case as $\Gamma(n \frac{L-2}{L+2})$, where $L$ is the order of
the polynom. It means that the point $\Dt=0$ is singular point of the kernel.
