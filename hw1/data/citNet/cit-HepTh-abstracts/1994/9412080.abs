  A matrix model to describe dynamical loops on random planar graphs is
analyzed. It has similarities with a model studied by Kazakov, few years ago,
and the O(n) model by Kostov and collaborators. The main difference is that all
loops are coherently oriented and empty. The free energy is analytically
evaluated and the two critical phases are analyzed, where the free energy
exhibits the same critical behaviour of Kazakov's model, thus confirming the
universality of the description in the continuum limit (surface with small
holes, and the tearing phase). A third phase occurs on the boundary separating
the above phase regions, and is characterized by a different singular
behaviour, presumably due to the orientation of loops.
