  We consider the forced harmonic oscillator quantized according to infinite
statistics ( a special case of the `quon' algebra proposed by Greenberg ). We
show that in order for the statistics to be consistently evolved the forcing
term must be identically zero for all time. Hence only the free harmonic
oscillator may be quantized according to infinite statistics.
