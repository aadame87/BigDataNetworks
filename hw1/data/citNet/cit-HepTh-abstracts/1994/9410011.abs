  In this paper we discuss the connection on a space of $N=2$ TCFT's that
appears in the context of background (in)dependence. We formulate a family of
{\it target space field theories} with a similar connection on it. Each theory
is a gauge theory (with the gauge group being ${\cal SD}iff $ in the case of
$3$-fold). It describes deformations of K\"ahler structures much like Kodaira
Spencer theory describes deformations of the complex structures. It is
manifestly background independent. It appears to be a target space field theory
for supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
