  We discuss the nonlinear extension of $N=2$ superconformal algebra by
generalizing Sugawara construction and coset construction built from $N=2$
currents based on Kazama-Suzuki $N=2$ coset model $\frac{SU(3)}{SU(2) \times
U(1)}$ in $N=2$ superspace. For the generic unitary minimal series $c =
6(1-\frac{3}{k+3})$ where $k$ is the level of $SU(3)$ supersymmetric
Wess-Zumino-Witten model, this algebra reproduces exactly $N=2$ $W_3$ algebra
which has been worked out by Romans in component formalism.
