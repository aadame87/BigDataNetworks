  Coherent state operators (CSO) are defined as operator valued functions on
G=SL(n,C), homogeneous with respect to right multiplication by lower triangular
matrices. They act on a model space containing all holomorphic finite
dimensional representations of G with multiplicity 1. CSO provide an analytic
tool for studying G invariant 2- and 3-point functions, which are written down
in the case of $SU_3$. The quantum group deformation of the construction gives
rise to a non-commutative coset space. We introduce a "standard" polynomial
basis in this space (related to but not identical with the Lusztig canonical
basis) which is appropriate for writing down $U_q(sl_3)$ invariant 2-point
functions for representaions of the type $(\lambda,0)$ and $(0,\lambda)$.
General invariant 2-point functions are written down in a mixed
Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt type basis.
