  Second quantization is revisited and creation and annihilation operators
areshown to be related, on the same footing both to the algebra h(1), and to
the superalgebra osp(1|2) that are shown to be both compatible with Bose and
Fermi statistics.
  The two algebras are completely equivalent in the one-mode sector but,
because of grading of osp(1|2), differ in the many-particle case.
  The same scheme is straightforwardly extended to the quantum case h_q(1) and
osp_q(1|2).
