  We study quasifinite highest weight modules over the supersymmetric extension
of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra on the basis of the analysis by Kac and Radul. We
find that the quasifiniteness of the modules is again characterized by
polynomials, and obtain the differential equations for highest weights. The
spectral flow, free field realization over the $(B,C)$--system, and the
embedding into $\Glinf$ are also presented.
