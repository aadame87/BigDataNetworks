Title: Varieties of Quantum Measurement
Authors: W. G. Unruh
Comments: 14pp
\\
  Quantum measurement theory has fallen under the resticting influence of the
attempt to explain the fundamental axioms of quantum theory in terms of the
theory itself. This has not only led to confusion but has also restricted our
attention to a limited class of measurements. This paper outlines some of the
novel types of measurements which fall outside the usual textbook description.
