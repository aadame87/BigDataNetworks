  The fibre bundle formulation of gauge theory is generally accepted. The jet
manifold machinery completes this formulation and provides the adequate
mathematical description of dynamics of fields represented by sections of fibre
bundles. Theory of differential operators, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
formalisms on bundles have utilized widely the language of jet manifolds.
Moreover, when not restricted to principal connections, differential geometry
also is phrased in jet terms. However, this powerful tool remains almost
unknown to physicists. These Lectures give introduction to jet manifolds,
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms in jet manifolds and their application to
a number of fundamental field models.
