  The dilute A$_3$ lattice model in regime 2 is in the universality class
of the Ising model in a magnetic field. Here we establish directly the
existence of an E$_8$ structure in the dilute A$_3$ model in this regime by
expressing the 1-dimensional configuration sums in terms of fermionic sums
which explicitly involve the E$_8$ root system.  In the thermodynamic
limit, these polynomial identities yield a proof of the E$_8$
Rogers--Ramanujan identity recently conjectured by Kedem {\em et al}.
  The polynomial identities also apply to regime 3, which is obtained by
transforming the modular parameter by $q\to 1/q$. In this case we find an
A$_1\times\mbox{E}_7$ structure and prove a Rogers--Ramanujan identity of
A$_1\times\mbox{E}_7$ type. Finally, in the critical $q\to 1$ limit, we
give some intriguing expressions for the number of $L$-step paths on the
A$_3$ Dynkin diagram with tadpoles in terms of the E$_8$ Cartan matrix. All
our findings confirm the E$_8$ and E$_7$ structure of the dilute A$_3$
model found recently by means of the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz.
