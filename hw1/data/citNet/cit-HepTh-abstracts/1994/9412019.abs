  The Kalb-Ramond action, derived for interacting strings through an
action-at-a-distance force, is generalized to the case of interacting
p-dimensional objects (p-branes) in D-dimensional space-time. The open p-brane
version of the theory is especially taken up. On account of the existence of
their boundary surface, the fields mediating interactions between open p-branes
are obtained as massive gauge fields, quite in contrast to massless gauge ones
for closed p-branes.
