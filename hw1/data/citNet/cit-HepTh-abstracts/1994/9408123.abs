Title: On Little Groups and Boosts of $\kappa$-deformed Poincare Group
Authors: S. Rouhani and A. Shariati

\\
  We show how Wigner's little group approach to the representation theory of
Poincar\'e group may be generalized to the case of $\kappa$-deformed
  Poincar\'e group. We also derive the deformed Lorentz transformations of
energy and momentum. We find that if the $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e group is
adopted as the fundamental symmetry of nature, it results in deviations from
predictions of the Poincar\'e symmetry at large energies, which may be
experimentally observable.
