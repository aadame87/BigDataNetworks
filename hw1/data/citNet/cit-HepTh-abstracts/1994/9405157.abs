  The `classical' model for a massive spinning particle, which was recently
proposed, is derived from the isotropic rotator model. Through this derivation,
we note that the spin can be understood as the relativistic extension of the
isotropic rotator. Furthermore, the variables $t_\m$ corresponding to the
$\p^*$ of the `pseudo-classical' model, are necessary for the covariant
formulation. The dynamical term for these extra variables is naturally obtained
and the meaning of the constraint term $p^\s\L_{\s\n}+mt_\n =0$, which was
recently shown to give `quasi-supersymmetry', is clarified.
