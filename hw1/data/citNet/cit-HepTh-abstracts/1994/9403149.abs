Title: Quantum Integrals of Motion for the Heisenberg Spin Chain
Authors: Marek P. Grabowski and Pierre Mathieu
Comments: 10 pages Report #: LAVAL-PHY-94-20
\\
  An explicit expression for all the quantum integrals of motion for the
isotropic Heisenberg $s=1/2$ spin chain is presented.
  The conserved quantities are expressed in terms of a sum over simple
polynomials in spin variables. This construction is direct and independent of
the transfer matrix formalism. Continuum limits of these integrals in both
ferrromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sectors are briefly discussed.
