  We investigate the stability of the extremal black p-brane which contains a
n-form and a dilaton. We show that the instability due to the s-mode, which was
present in the uncharged and non-extremal p-brane, disappears in the extreme
case. This is shown to be consistent with an entropy argument which shows that
the zero entropy of the extremal black hole is approached more rapidly than the
zero entropy of the black p-brane, which would mean an instability would
violate the second law of thermodynamics.
