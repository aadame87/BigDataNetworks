  I review the foundations of irrational conformal field theory (ICFT), which
includes rational conformal field theory as a small subspace. Highlights of the
review include the Virasoro master equation and the generalized
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the correlators of ICFT on the sphere and
the torus.
