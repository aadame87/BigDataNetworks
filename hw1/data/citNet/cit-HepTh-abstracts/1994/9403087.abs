Title: Cosmological Surrealism: More than ``Eternal Reality" is Needed
Authors: Yuval Ne'eman
Comments: 7 pages, TAUP N237

  Inflationary Cosmology makes the universe ``eternal" and provides for
recurrent universe creation, ad infinitum -- making it also plausible to assume
that ``our" Big Bang was also preceeded by others, etc.. However, GR tells us
that in the ``parent" universe's reference frame, the newborn universe's
expansion will never start. Our picture of ``reality" in spacetime has to be
enlarged.
