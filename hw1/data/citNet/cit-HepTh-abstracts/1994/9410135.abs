Title: $h$-Deformation as a Contraction of $q$-Deformation
Authors: A. Aghamohammadi, M. Khorrami and A. Shariati
Comments: 6 pages, LaTeX, IPM-94-61
\\
  We show that $h$-deformation can be obtained, by a singular limit of a
similarity transformation, from $q$-deformation; to be specefic, we obtain
$\GL_h(2)$, its differential structure, its inhomogenous extension, and
$\Uh{\sl(2)}$ from their $q$-deformed counterparts.
