  The SU(3) modular invariant partition functions were first completely
classified in Ref.\ \SU. The purpose of these notes is four-fold: \item{(i)}
Here we accomplish the SU(3) classification using only the most basic facts:
modular invariance; $M_{\la\mu}\in{\bf Z}_{\ge}$; and $M_{00}=1$. In \SU{} we
made use of less elementary results from Moore-Seiberg, in addition to these 3
basic facts. \item{(ii)} Ref.\ \SU{} was completed well over a year ago. Since
then I have found a number of significant simplifications to the general
argument. They are all included here. \item{(iii)} A number of people have
complained that some of the arguments in \SU{} were hard to follow. I have
tried here to be as explicit and as clear as possible. \item{(iv)} Hidden in
\SU{} were a number of smaller results which should be of independent value.
These are explicitly mentioned here.
