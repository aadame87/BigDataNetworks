  We begin with a prior observation by one of us that Thomas precession in the
nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation may be attributed to a nonabelian
Berry vector potential. We ask what object produces the nonabelian potential in
parameter space, in the same sense that the abelian vector potential arising in
the adiabatic transport of a nondegenerate level is produced by a monopole,
(centered at the point where the level becomes degenerate with another), as
shown by Berry. We find that it is a {\em meron}, an object in four euclidean
dimensions with instanton number ${1 \over 2}$, centered at the point where the
doubly degenerate positive and negative energy levels of the Dirac equation
become fourfold degenerate.
