  The machinery of braided geometry introduced previously is used now to
construct the $\epsilon$ `totally antisymmetric tensor' on a general braided
vector space determined by R-matrices. This includes natural $q$-Euclidean and
$q$-Minkowski spaces. The formalism is completely covariant under the
corresponding quantum group such as $\widetilde{SO_q(4)}$ or
$\widetilde{SO_q(1,3)}$. The Hodge $*$ operator and differentials are also
constructed in this approach.
