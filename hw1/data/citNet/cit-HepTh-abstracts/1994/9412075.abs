  We derive the large k asymptotics of the surgery formula for SU(2) Witten's
invariants of general Seifert manifolds. The contributions of connected
components of the moduli space of flat connections are identified. The
contributions of irreducible connections are presented in a residue form. This
form is similar to the one used by A. Szenes, L. Jeffrey and F. Kirwan. This
similarity allows us to express the contributions of irreducible connections in
terms of intersection numbers on their moduli spaces.
