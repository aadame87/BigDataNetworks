Title: Classical Electrodynamics with Dual Potentials
Authors: M. Baker, James S. Ball, F. Zachariasen
Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures not included, CALT-68-1890
\\
  We present Dirac's method for using dual potentials to solve classical
electrodynamics for an oppositely charged pair of particles, with a view to
extending these techniques to non-Abelian gauge theories.
