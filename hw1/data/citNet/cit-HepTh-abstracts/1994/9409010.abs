  We consider a theory of a scalar one-component field $\phi$ coupled to a
scalar $N$-component field $\chi$. Using large $N$ techiques we calculate the
effective potential in the leading order in $1/N$. We show that this is
equivalent to a resummation of an infinite subclass of graphs in perturbation
theory, which involve fluctuations of the $\chi$ field only. We study the
temperature dependence of the expectation value of the $\phi$ field and the
resulting first and second order phase transitions.
