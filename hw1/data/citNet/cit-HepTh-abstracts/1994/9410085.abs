  Laymen and sometimes even physicists think of natural sciences, in particular
of theoretical and mathematical physics often as subjects, which unfold
according to an intrinsic logical pattern, with the limitations being set only
by the conceptual and (in case of mathematical physics) mathematical
developments of the times. This view certainly cannot be maintained in view of
the present stagnation and crisis which in particular affects QFT, an area
which in the past has been most innovating and fruitful, also in relation to
other important areas of theoretical physics.
