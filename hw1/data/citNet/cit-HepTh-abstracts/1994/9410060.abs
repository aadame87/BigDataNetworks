  This paper belongs to the series devoted to the calculation of particle
masses in the framework of p-adic conformal field theory limit of Topological
GeometroDynamics. In paper II the general formulation of p-adic Higgs mechanism
was given. In this paper the calculation of the fermionic and bosonic masses is
carried out. The calculation of the masses necessitates the evaluation of dege-
neracies for states as a function of conformal weight in certain tensor product
of Super Virasoro algebras. The masses are very sen- sitive to the degeneracy
ratios: Planck mass results unless the ratio for the degeneracies for first
excited states and massless states is an integer multiple of 2/3. For leptons,
quarks and gauge bosons this miracle occurs. The main deviation from standard
model is the prediction of light color excited leptons and quarks as well as
colored boson exotics. Higgs particle is absent from spectrum as is also
graviton: the latter is due to the basic approximation of p-adic TGD. Reason
for replacement: the recently identified light colored boson exotics making
theory asymptotically free in standard sense.
