  We consider a spontaneously broken nonabelian topologically massive gauge
theory in a broken phase possessing a residual nonabelian symmetry. Recently
there has been some question concerning the renormalization of the Chern-Simons
coefficient in such a broken phase. We show that, in this broken vacuum, the
renormalized ratio of the Chern-Simons coupling to the gauge coupling is
shifted by $1/4\pi$ times an integer, preserving the usual integer quantization
condition on the bare parameters.
