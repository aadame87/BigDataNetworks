  At high energy scale the only quantum effect of any asymptotic free and
asymptotically conformal invariant GUT is the trace anomaly of the
energy-momentum tensor. Anomaly generates the new degree of freedom, that is
propagating conformal factor. At lower energies conformal factor starts to
interact with scalar field because of the violation of conformal invariance. We
estimate the effect of such an interaction and find the running of the
nonminimal coupling from conformal value $\frac{1}{6}$ to $0$. Then we discuss
the possibility of the first order phase transition induced by curvature in a
region close to the stable fixed point and calculate the induced values of
Newtonian and cosmological constants.
