  We consider a version of generalised $q$-oscillators and some of their
applications. The generalisation includes also "quons" of infinite statistics
and deformed oscillators of parastatistics. The statistical distributions for
different $q$-oscillators are derived for their corresponding Fock space
representations. The deformed Virasoro algebra and SU(2) algebra are also
treated.
