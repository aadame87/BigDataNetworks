  Within the setting of algebraic quantum field theory a relation between
phase-space properties of observables and charged fields is established. These
properties are expressed in terms of compactness and nuclearity conditions
which are the basis for the characterization of theories with physically
reasonable causal and thermal features. Relevant concepts and results of phase
space analysis in algebraic quantum field theory are reviewed and the
underlying ideas are outlined.
