  When high energy strings scatter at fixed angle, their amplitudes
characteristically fall off exponentially with energy, ${\cal A} \sim \exp(-s
\times const.)$. We show that in a compact space this suppression disappears
for certain kinematic configurations. Amplitudes are power-law behaved and
therefore greatly enhanced. In spacetime this corresponds to fixed-angle
scattering, with fixed transfer in the compact dimensions. On the worldsheet
this process is described by a stationary configuration of effective charges
and vortices with vanishing total energy. It is worldsheet duality---and not
spacetime duality---that plays a role.
