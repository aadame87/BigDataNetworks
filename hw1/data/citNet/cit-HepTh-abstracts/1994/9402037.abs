  We introduce an algebraic theory of integration on quantum planes and other
braided spaces. In the one dimensional case we obtain a novel picture of the
Jackson $q$-integral as indefinite integration on the braided group of
functions in one variable $x$. Here $x$ is treated with braid statistics $q$
rather than the usual bosonic or Grassmann ones. We show that the definite
integral $\int x$ can also be evaluated algebraically as multiples of the
integral of a $q$-Gaussian, with $x$ remaining as a bosonic scaling variable
associated with the $q$-deformation. Further composing our algebraic
integration with a representation then leads to ordinary numbers for the
integral. We also use our integration to develop a full theory of $q$-Fourier
transformation $F$. We use the braided addition $\Delta x=x\otimes 1+1\otimes
x$ and braided-antipode $S$ to define a convolution product, and prove a
convolution theorem. We prove also that $F^2=S$. We prove the analogous results
on any braided group, including integration and Fourier transformation on
quantum planes associated to general R-matrices, including $q$-Euclidean and
$q$-Minkowski spaces.
