  The renormalization-group improved effective potential ---to leading-log and
in the linear curvature approximation--- is constructed for ``finite'' theories
in curved spacetime. It is not trivial and displays a quite interesting,
exponential-like structure ---in contrast with the case of flat spacetime where
it coincides with the classical potential. Several possible cosmological
applications, as curvature-induced phase transitions and modifications of the
values of the gravitational and cosmological constants, are briefly discussed.
