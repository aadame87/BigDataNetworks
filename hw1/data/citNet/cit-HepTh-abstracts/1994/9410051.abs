  The requirement of an $SL(2)$ duality symmetry, mixing the worldvolume field
equations with Bianchi identities, leads to a highly nonlinear equation
involving the transformation parameters and certain worldvolume currents. In
general, this equation seems to admit a solution only for a two parameter
subgroup of the seeked $SL(2)$. These transformations also leave invariant the
first class constraints generating the worldvolume reparametrizations. In the
special case of $p$--branes in $p+1$ dimensions, the full $SL(2)$ is realized.
