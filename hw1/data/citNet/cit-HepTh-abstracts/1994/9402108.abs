  Based on the extended BRST formalism of Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky, we
perform a general algebraic analysis of the BRST anomalies in superstring
theory of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond. Consistency conditions on the BRST anomalies
are completely solved. The genuine super-Virasoro anomaly is identified with
the essentially unique solution to the consistency condition without any
reference to a particular gauge for the 2D supergravity fields. In a
configuration space where metric and gravitino fields are properly constructed,
general form of the super-Weyl anomaly is obtained from the super-Virasoro
anomaly as its descendant.
  We give a novel local action of super-Liouville type, which plays a role of
Wess-Zumino-Witten term shifting the super-Virasoro anomaly into the super-Weyl
anomaly. These results reveal a hierarchial relationship in the BRST anoamlies.
