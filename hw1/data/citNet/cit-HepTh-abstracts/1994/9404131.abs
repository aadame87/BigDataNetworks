  In a recent work it has been shown that the bosonic strings could be embedded
into a special class of $N=1$ fermionic strings. We argue that the
superpartners of any physical state in the spectrum of this fermionic string is
non-physical. So, there is no supersymmetry in the space of physical states and
the embedding is, in this sense, ``trivial''. We here propose two different
constructions as possible candidates of non-trivial embeddings of the
non-critical bosonic strings into some special class of $N=1$ fermionic strings
of which one is the non-critical NSR string. The BRST charge of the $N=1$
fermionic strings in both cases decompose as $Q_{N=1} = Q_B + {\tilde Q}$,
where $Q_B$ is the BRST charge of the bosonic string.
