Title: Some Remarks on the Quantum Double
Author: Shahn Majid
Comments: 15 pages
Report-no: DAMTP/94-70

  We recall the abstract theory of Hopf algebra bicrossproducts and double
cross products due to the author. We use it to develop some less-well known
results about the quantum double as a twisting, as an extension and as
$q$-Lorentz group.
