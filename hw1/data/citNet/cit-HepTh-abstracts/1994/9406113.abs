Title: Racks and Orbits of Dressing Transformations
Authors: A. Balinsky
Comments: LaTex-file, 9 pp
\\
  New algebraic structure on the orbits of dressing transformations of the
quasitriangular Poisson Lie groups is provided. This give the topological
interpretation of the link invariants associated with the Weinstein--Xu
classical solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. Some applications to
the three-dimensional topological quantum field theories are discussed.
