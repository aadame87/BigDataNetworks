  The general theory of a massless fermion coupled to a massive vector meson in
two dimensions is formulated and solved to obtain the complete set of Green's
functions. Both vector and axial vector couplings are included. In addition to
the boson mass and the two coupling constants, a coefficient which denotes a
particular current definition is required for a unique specification of the
model.
  The resulting four parameter theory and its solution are shown to reduce in
appropriate limits to all the known soluble models, including in particular the
Schwinger model and its axial vector variant.
