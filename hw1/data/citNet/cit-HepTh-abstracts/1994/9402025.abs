Title: Deterministic Quantum Mechanics

  Present quantum theory, which is statistical in nature, does not predict
joint probability distribution of position and momentum because they are
noncommuting. We propose a deterministic quantum theory which predicts a joint
probability distribution such that the separate probability distributions for
position and momentum agree with usual quantum theory. Unlike the Wigner
distribution the suggested distribution is positive definite. The theory
predicts a correlation between position and momentum in individual events.
