  A $q$-deformed free spinning relativistic particle is discussed in the
framework of the Lagrangian formalism. Three equivalent Lagrangians are
obtained for this system which are endowed with $q$-deformed local (super)gauge
symmetries and reparametrization invariance. It is demonstrated that these
symmetries are on-shell equivalent only for $ q = \pm1 $ under particular
identification of the transformation parameters. The same condition ($ q=\pm1
$) emerges due to the requirement that the $q$-commutator of two supersymmetric
gauge transformations should generate a reparametrization plus a supersymmetric
gauge transformation. For a specific gauge choice, the solutions for equations
of motion respect $GL_{\surd q}(1|1)$ and $GL_{q}(2)$ invariances for any
arbitrary value of the evolution parameter characterizing the quantum super
world-line.
