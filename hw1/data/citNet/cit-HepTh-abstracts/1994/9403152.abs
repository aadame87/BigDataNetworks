Title: Negative Flows of the KP-Hierarchy
Authors: G. Haak
Comments: 22 pages (LaTeX), Report KITCS94-2-1
\\
  We construct a Grassmannian-like formulation for the potential KP-hierarchy
including additional ``negative'' flows. Our approach will generalize the
notion of a tau-function to include negative flows. We compare the resulting
hierarchy with results by Hirota, Satsuma and Bogoyavlenskii.
