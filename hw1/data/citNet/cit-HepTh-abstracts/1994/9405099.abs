  We investigate the 3d lattice topological field theories defined by Chung,
Fukuma and Shapere. We concentrate on the model defined by taking a deformation
$\D{G}$ of the quantum double of a finite commutative group $G$ as the
underlying Hopf algebra. It is suggested that Chung-Fukuma-Shapere partition
function is related to that of Dijkgraaf-Witten by $\zcfs = |\zdw|^2$ when
$G=\Z_{2N+1}$. For $G=\Z_{2N}$, such a relation does not hold.
