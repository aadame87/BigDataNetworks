  Eleven different types of "maximally superintegrable" Hamiltonian systems on
the real hyperboloid $(s^0)^2-(s^1)^2+(s^2)^2-(s^3)^2=1$ are obtained. All of
them correspond to a free Hamiltonian system on the homogeneous space
$SU(2,2)/U(2,1)$, but to reductions by different maximal abelian subgroups of
$SU(2,2)$. Each of the obtained systems allows 5 functionally independent
integrals of motion, from which it is possible to form two or more triplets in
involution (each of them includes the hamiltonian). The corresponding classical
and quantum equations of motion can be solved by separation of variables on the
$O(2,2)$ space.
