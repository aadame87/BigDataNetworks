  For $2D$ string theory, the perturbative $S$-matrices are not well-defined
due to a zero mode divergence. Although there exist formal procedures to make
the integral convergent, their physical meanings are unclear. We describe a
method to obtain finite $S$-matrices physically to justify the formal schemes.
The scheme uses asymptotic states by wave packets which fall faster than
exponentials. It is shown that the scheme gives well-defined $S$-matrices and
justifies the formal shifted Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for simple processes.
The tree-level unitarity for these processes is also shown. We point out a
problem in this scheme.
