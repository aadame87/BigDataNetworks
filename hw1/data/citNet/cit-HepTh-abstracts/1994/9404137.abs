  The purpose of this very short note, which maybe considered as a comment on
"hep-th/9401067", is to prove the following proposition. PROPOSITION. There
exist certain models of Mobilevision, in which interpretational figures are
observable only in a multi--user mode in contrast to single--user ones. This
result maybe interesting as for applications as for the understanding of
theoretical foundations of quantum interactive processes (hep-th/9403015).
