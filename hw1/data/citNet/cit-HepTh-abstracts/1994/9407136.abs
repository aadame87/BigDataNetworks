Title: Strings and Loops in Event Symmetric Space-Time
Authors: P. E. Gibbs
Comments: 32 pages, Tex , PEG-03-94
\\
  Open and Closed super-string field theories are constructed in an
event-symmetric target space. The partition functions of Statistical and
Quantum models are constructed in terms of invariants defined on Lie-algebra
representations. An attractive feature of the closed string models is the
elegant unification of the space-time symmetries with the gauge symmetries.
