  Quantum theory of conformal factor coupled with matter fields is
investigated. The more simple case of the purely classical scalar matter is
considered. It is calculated the conformal factor contribution to the effective
potential of scalar field. Then the possibility of the first order phase
transition is explored and the induced values of Newtonian and cosmological
constants are calculated.
