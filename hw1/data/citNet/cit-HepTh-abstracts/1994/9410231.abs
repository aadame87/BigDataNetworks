  We consider the non-commutative generalization of the chiral perturbation
theory. The resultant coupling constants are severely restricted by the model
and in good agreement with the data. When applied to the Skyrme model, our
scheme reproduces the non-Skyrme term with the right coefficient. We comment on
a similar treatment of the linear $\sigma $-model.
