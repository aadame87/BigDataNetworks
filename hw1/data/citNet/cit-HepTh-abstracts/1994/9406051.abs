  The purpose of this paper is to apply the framework of non- commutative
differential geometry to quantum deformations of a class of Kahler manifolds.
For the examples of the Cartan domains of type I and flat space, we construct
Fredholm modules over the quantized manifolds using the supercharges which
arise in the quantization of supersymmetric generalizations of the manifolds.
We compute the explicit formula for the Chern character on generators of the
Toeplitz C^* -algebra.
