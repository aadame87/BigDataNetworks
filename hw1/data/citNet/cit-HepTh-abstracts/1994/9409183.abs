  We quantize the self-dual massive theory by using the Batalin-Tyutin
Hamiltonian method, which systematically embeds second class constraint system
into first class one in the extended phase space by introducing the new fields.
Through this analysis we obtain simultaneously the St\"uckelberg scalar term
related to the explicit gauge-breaking effect and the new type of Wess-Zumino
action related to the Chern-Simons term.
