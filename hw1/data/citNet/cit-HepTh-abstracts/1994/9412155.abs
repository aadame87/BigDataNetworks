  Recently E.Verlinde and H.Verlinde have suggested an effective
two-dimensional theory describing the high-energy scattering in QCD. In this
report we attempt to clarify some issues of this suggestion. We consider {\it
anisotropic asymptotics} of correlation functions for scalar and gauge theories
in four dimensions. Anisotropic asymptotics describe behaviour of correlation
functions when some components of coordinates are large as compare with others
components. It is occurred that (2+2) anisotropic asymptotics for 4-points
functions are related with the well known Regge regime of scattering
amplitudes. We study an expansion of correlation functions with respect to the
rescaling parameter $\lambda$ over a part of variables (anisotropic
$\lambda$-expansion). An effective theory describing the anisotropic limit of
free scalar field contains two 2 dim conformal theories. One of them is a
conformal theory in configuration space and another one is a conformal theory
in momentum space. In some special cases ,in particular for the Wilson line
correlators in gauge theories, the leading term of the anisotropic expansion
involves only one of the conformal theories and it can be described by an
effective theory with an action being a dimensional reduction of the original
action.
