  The purpose of this paper is to introduce the cohomology of various algebras
over an operad of moduli spaces including the cohomology of conformal field
theories (CFT's) and vertex operator algebras (VOA's). This cohomology theory
produces a number of invariants of CFT's and VOA's, one of which is the space
of their infinitesimal deformations.
