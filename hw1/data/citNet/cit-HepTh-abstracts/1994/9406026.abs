  It is argued on general ground and demonstrated in the particular example of
the Chiral Schwinger Model that there is nothing wrong with apparently
anomalous chiral gauge theory. If quantised correctly, there should be no gauge
anomaly and chiral gauge theory should be renormalisable and unitary, even in
higher dimensions and with non-abelian gauge groups. Furthermore, mass terms
for gauge bosons and chiral fermions can be generated without spoiling the
gauge invariance.
