  We advocate a new approach to the study of unitary matrix models in external
fields which emphasizes their relationship to Generalized Kontsevich Models
(GKM) with non-polynomial potentials. For example, we show that the partition
function of the Brezin-Gross-Witten Model (BGWM), which is defined as an
integral over unitary $N\times N$ matrices, $\int [dU] e^{\rm{Tr}(J^\dagger U +
JU^\dagger)}$, can also be considered as a GKM with potential ${\cal V}(X) =
\frac{1}{X}$. Moreover, it can be interpreted as the generating functional for
correlators in the Penner model. The strong and weak coupling phases of the
BGWM are identified with the "character" (weak coupling) and "Kontsevich"
(strong coupling) phases of the GKM, respectively. This sort of GKM deserves
classification as $p=-2$ one (i.e. $c=28$ or $c=-2$) when in the Kontsevich
phase. This approach allows us to further identify the
Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber (IZ) integral with a peculiar GKM, which arises
in the study of $c=1$ theory and, further, with a conventional 2-matrix model
which is rewritten in Miwa coordinates. Inspired by the considered unitary
matrix models, some further extensions of the GKM treatment which are inspired
by the unitary matrix models which we have considered are also developed. In
particular, as a by-product, a new simple method of fixing the Ward identities
for matrix models in an external field is presented.
