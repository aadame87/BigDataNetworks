  We examine the thermal behavior of a theory with charged massive vector
matter coupled to Chern-Simons gauge field. We obtain a critical temperature
Tc, at which the effective mass of vector field vanishes, and the system
transfers from a symmetry broken phase to topological phase. The phase
transition is suggested to be of the zeroth order, as the free energy of the
system is discontinuous at Tc. Application to the (2+1) dimensional quantum
gravity is briefly discussed.
