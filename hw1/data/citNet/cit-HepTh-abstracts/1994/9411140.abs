  We introduce a general theory of twisting algebraic structures based on
actions of a bialgebra. These twists are closely related to algebraic
deformations and also to the theory of quasi-triangular bialgebras. In
particular, a deformation produced from a universal deformation formula (UDF)
is a special case of a twist. The most familiar example of a deformation
produced from a UDF is perhaps the "Moyal product" which (locally) is the
canonical quantization of the algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold in
the direction of the Poisson bracket. In this case, the derivations comprising
the Poisson bracket mutually commute and so this quantization is essentially
obtained by exponentiating this bracket. For more general Poisson manifolds,
this formula is not applicable since the associated derivations may no longer
commute. We provide here generalizations of the Moyal formula which (locally)
give canonical quantizations of various Poisson manifolds. Specifically,
whenever a certain central extension of a Heisenberg Lie group acts on a
manifold, we obtain a quantization of its algebra of functions in the direction
of a suitable Poisson bracket obtained from noncommuting derivations.
