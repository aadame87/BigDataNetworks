  We introduce a notion  of elliptic differential graded Lie algebra.
The class of elliptic algebras contains such examples as the algebra
of differential forms with values in endomorphisms of a flat vector
bundle over a compact manifold, etc.
  For elliptic differential graded algebra we construct a complete set of
deformations.
  We show that for several deformation problems the existence of a formal
power series solution guarantees the existence of an analytic solution.
