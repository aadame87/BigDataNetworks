    I start from the Bargmann-Wigner equations and introduce
an interaction in the form which is similar to a $j=1/2$ case
[M. Moshinsky \& A. Szczepaniak, {\it J. Phys. \,A}{\bf 22}  (1989)
L817]. By means of the expansion of the wave function in the complete
set of $\gamma$- matrices one can obtain the equations for a system
which could be named as the $j=0$ Kemmer-Dirac oscillator.
    The equations for the components $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are
different from the ones obtained by Y. Nedjadi \& R. Barrett
for the $j=0$ Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator [{\it J. Phys.\,A}
{\bf 27} (1994) 4301]. This fact leads to the dissimilar
energy spectrum of the $j=0$ relativistic oscillator.
