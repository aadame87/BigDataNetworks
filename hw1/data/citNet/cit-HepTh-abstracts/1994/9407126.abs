Title: On the composite fermion approach in the FQHE
Authors: M.Eliashvili
Comments: 9p.LATEX
\\
  FQHE is presented in the form of non-unitary singular similarity
transformation, which relates the Laughlin wave function (and its particle-hole
conjugate) to the composite quasi- particle incompressible ground state.
