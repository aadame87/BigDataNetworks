  Presented are polynomial identities which imply generalizations of Euler and
Rogers--Ramanujan identities. Both sides of the identities can be interpreted
as generating functions of certain restricted partitions. We prove the
identities by establishing a graphical one-to-one correspondence between those
two kinds of restricted partitions.
