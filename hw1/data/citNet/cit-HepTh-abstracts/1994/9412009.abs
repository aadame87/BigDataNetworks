  The recently introduced Galois symmetries of RCFT are generalized, for the
WZW case, to `quasi-Galois symmetries'. These symmetries can be used to derive
a large number of equalities and sum rules for entries of the modular matrix S,
including some that previously had been observed empirically. In addition,
quasi-Galois symmetries allow to construct modular invariants and to relate
S-matrices as well as modular invariants at different levels. They also lead us
to an extremely plausible conjecture for the branching rules of the conformal
embeddings of g into so(dim g).
