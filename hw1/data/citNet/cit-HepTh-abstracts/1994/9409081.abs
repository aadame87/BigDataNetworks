  The BRST transformations for the Yang-Mills gauge fields in the presence of
gravity described by Ashtekar variables are obtained by using the so-called
Maurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. The BRST cohomology group expressed by
the Wess-Zumino consistency condition is solved with the help of an operator
$\delta$ introduced by S.P. Sorella which in our case has a very simple form
and generates, together with the differential $d$ and the BRST operator $s$, a
simpler algebra than in the pure Yang-Mills theory. In this way we shall find
the Yang-Mills Lagrangians, the Chern-Simons terms and the gauge anomalies.
