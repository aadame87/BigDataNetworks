\\
  A consistent Euclidean semi classical calculation is given for the
superscattering operator $\$ $ in the RST model for states with a constant flux
of energy. The $\$ $ operator is CPT invariant. There is no loss of quantum
coherence when the energy flux is less than a critical rate and complete loss
when the energy flux is critical.
