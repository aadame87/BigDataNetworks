Title: Quantum inconsistency of W3-gravity models associated with magical
  Jordan algebras
Authors: S.A. Lyakhovich and A.A. Sharapov
Comments: LaTeX, 4 pages, no figures
\\
  It is shown that the Sugawara-type construction for W3-algebra associated
with the four magical Jordan algebras leads to the anomalous theory of
W3-gravity.
