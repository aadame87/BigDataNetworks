Title: Addendum to: ``Symmetries of the Bosonic String S-Matrix,''
Authors: Gregory Moore
Comments: 6pp, harvmac,Texable version
\\
  In a previous paper we showed that bracket relations uniquely fix the
tree-level bosonic string $S$-matrix for $N\leq 26$ particle scattering. In
this note we extend the proof to $N$-particle scattering for all $N$.
