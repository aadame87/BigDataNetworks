  In terms of the gauged nonlinear $\sigma$-models, we describe some results
and implications of solving the following problem: Given a smooth symplectic
manifold as target space with a quasi-free Hamiltonian group action, perform
the symplectic blowing up of the point singularity and identify the blow-up
modes in the corresponding (gauged) $\sigma$-model. Both classical and quantum
aspects of the construction are explained, along with illustrating examples
from the toric projective space and the K\"ahler manifold. We also discuss
related problems such as the origin of Mirror symmetry and the quantum
cohomologies.(Talk to be given at ICHEP94, Glasgow, July 20-27.)
