  A general framework for the deformation of the single-mode oscillators is
presented and all deformed single-mode oscillators are unified. The extensions
of the Aric-Coon, genon, the para-Bose and the para-Fermi oscillators are
proposed. The generalized harmonic oscillator considered by Brzezinski et al.
is rederived in a simple way.Some remarks on deformation of $SU(1,1)$ and
supersymmetry are made.
