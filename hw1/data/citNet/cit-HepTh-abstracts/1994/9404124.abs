  A first order form of Regge calculus is defined in the spirit of Palatini's
action for general relativity. The extra independent variables are the interior
dihedral angles of a simplex, with conjugate variables the areas of the
triangles. There is a discussion of the extent to which these areas can be used
to parameterise the space of edge lengths of a simplex.
