Title: A $SU(2)$ Generalized Gauge Field Model With Higgs Mechanism
Authors: Hanying Guo and Jianming Li, 7 pages , Latex, ASITP-94-25
\\
  By means of the non-commutative differential geometry, we construct an
$SU(2)$ generalized gauge field model. It is of $SU(2) \times \pi_4(SU(2))$
gauge invariance. We show that this model not only includes the Higgs field
automatically on the equal footing with ordinary Yang-Mills gauge potentials
but also is stable against quantum correlation.
