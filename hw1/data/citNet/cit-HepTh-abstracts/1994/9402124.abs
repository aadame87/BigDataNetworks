  We develop the basic formalism of complex $q$-analysis to study the solutions
of second order $q$-difference equations which reduce, in the $q\rightarrow 1$
limit, to the ordinary Laplace equation in Euclidean and Minkowski space. After
defining an inner product on the function space we construct and study the
properties of the solutions, and then apply this formalism to the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation and two-dimensional scalar field theory.
