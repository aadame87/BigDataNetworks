  A derivation of the one-loop effective Lagrangian in the self-interacting
$O(N)$ scalar theory, in slowly varying gravitational fields, is presented
(using $\zeta$-regularization and heat-kernel techniques). The result is given
in terms of the expansion in powers of the curvature tensors (up to quadratic
terms) and their derivatives, as well as in derivatives of the background
scalar field (up to second derivatives). The renormalization group improved
effective Lagrangian is studied, what gives the leading-log approach of the
whole perturbation theory. An analysis of the effective equations
(back-reaction problem) on the static hyperbolic spacetime $\reals^2 \times
H^2/\Gamma$ is carried out for the simplest version of the theory: $m^2=0$ and
$N=1$. The existence of the solution $\reals^2 \times H^2/\Gamma$, induced by
purely quantum effects, is shown.
