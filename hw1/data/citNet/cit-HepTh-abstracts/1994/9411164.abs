  Gauge theories on manifolds with spatial boundaries are studied. It is shown
that observables localized at the boundaries (edge observables) can occur in
such models irrespective of the dimensionality of spacetime. The intimate
connection of these observables to charge fractionation, vertex operators and
topological field theories is described. The edge observables, however, may or
may not exist as well-defined operators in a fully quantized theory depending
on the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and their momenta. The latter
are obtained by requiring the Hamiltonian of the theory to be self-adjoint and
positive definite. We show that these boundary conditions can also have nice
physical interpretations in terms of certain experimental parameters such as
the penetration depth of the electromagnetic field in a surrounding
superconducting medium. The dependence of the spectrum on one such parameter is
explicitly exhibited for the Higgs model on a spatial disc in its London limit.
It should be possible to test such dependences experimentally, the above Higgs
model for example being a model for a superconductor. Boundary conditions for
the 3+1 dimensional $BF$ system confined to a spatial ball are studied. Their
physical meaning is clarified and their influence on the edge states of this
system (known to exist under certain conditions) is discussed. It is pointed
out that edge states occur for topological solitons of gauge theories such as
the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles.
