  We propose a method using perturbation theory in the running coupling
constant and the idea of scaling to determine improved actions for lattice
field theories combining Wilson's renormalization group with Symanzik's
improvement program . The method is based on the analysis of a single
renormalization group transformation. We test it on the hierarchical $O(N)$
invariant $\sigma$ model in two dimensions.
