  Chern-Simons gauge theory is formulated on three dimensional $Z_2$ orbifolds.
The locus of singular points on a given orbifold is equivalent to a link of
Wilson lines. This allows one to reduce any correlation function on orbifolds
to a sum of more complicated correlation functions in the simpler theory on
manifolds. Chern-Simons theory on manifolds is known to be related to 2D CFT on
closed string surfaces; here I show that the theory on orbifolds is related to
2D CFT of unoriented closed and open string models, i.e. to worldsheet orbifold
models. In particular, the boundary components of the worldsheet correspond to
the components of the singular locus in the 3D orbifold. This correspondence
leads to a simple identification of the open string spectra, including their
Chan-Paton degeneration, in terms of fusing Wilson lines in the corresponding
Chern-Simons theory. The correspondence is studied in detail, and some exactly
solvable examples are presented. Some of these examples indicate that it is
natural to think of the orbifold group $Z_2$ as a part of the gauge group of
the Chern-Simons theory, thus generalizing the standard definition of gauge
theories.
