Title: Global Aspects of Symmetries in Sigma Models with Torsion
Authors: G. Papadopoulos
Comments: 11pp
\\
  It is shown that non-trivial topological sectors can prevent the quantum
mechanical implementation of the symmetries of the classical field equations of
sigma models with torsion. The associated anomaly is computed, and it is shown
that it depends on the homotopy class of the topological sector of the theory
and the group action on the sigma model manifold that generates the symmetries
of the classical field equations.
