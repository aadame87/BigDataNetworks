  In this article we extend our previous results for the orthogonal group,
$SO(2,4)$, to its homomorphic group $SU(2,2)$. Here we present a closed, finite
formula for the exponential of a $4\times 4$ traceless matrix, which can be
viewed as the generator (Lie algebra elements) of the $SL(4,C)$ group. We apply
this result to the $SU(2,2)$ group, which Lie algebra can be represented by the
Dirac matrices, and discuss how the exponential map for $SU(2,2)$ can be
written by means of the Dirac matrices.
