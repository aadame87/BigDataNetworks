  We apply stochastic quantization method to matrix models for the second
quantization of loops in both discretized and continuum levels. The fictitious
time evolution described by the Langevin equation is interpreted as the time
evolution in a field theory of loops. The corresponding Fokker-Planck
hamiltonian defines a non-critical string field theory. We study both
orientable and non-orientable interactions of loops in terms of matrix models
and take the continuum limit for one-matrix case. As a consequence, we show the
equivalence of stochastic quantization of matrix models in loop space to the
transfer-matrix formalism in dynamical triangulation of random surfaces. We
also clarifies the origin of Virasoro algebra in this context.
