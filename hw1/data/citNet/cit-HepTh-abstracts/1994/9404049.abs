Title: Stochastic Quantization of Autonomous Phi**4
Authors: U. Ritschel
Comments: 8 pages Latex + corrected(!) Postscript file
\\
  The non-perturbative autonomous renormalization of the scalar $\Phi^4$-model
is applied in the framework of stochastic quantization. I show that this
requires a selective, momentum-dependent renormalization of the Onsager
coefficient $\lambda$, a direct consequence of the characteristic wavefunction
renormalization applied. As a result, I obtain a Langevin equation for the
renormalized constant mode of the field, which is solved numerically. It is
demonstrated for temperature zero that, starting from specified initial
conditions, the system relaxes to its equilibrium state, the symmetry-breaking
vacuum of the ``static'' $\Phi^4$-theory.
