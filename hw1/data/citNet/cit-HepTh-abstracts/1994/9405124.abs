  It is known that, in string sigma-model metric, the `extreme' fivebrane
solution of D=10 supergravity interpolates between D=10 Minkowski spacetime and
a supersymmetric $S^3$ compactification to a linear dilaton vacuum. We show
here that, in {\it fivebrane} sigma-model metric, the extreme string solution
of D=10 supergravity interpolates between Minkowski spacetime and a hitherto
unknown supersymmetric $S^7$ compactification of d=10 supergravity to a
three-dimensional anti-de Sitter generalization of the linear dilaton vacuum,
which may be invariantly characterized in terms of conformal
  Killing vectors. The dilaton field diverges near the string core but this
divergence may be eliminated by re-interpreting the string solution as the
extreme membrane solution of 11-dimensional supergravity. We show that the
latter has an analytic extension through a regular degenerate event horizon to
an interior region containing a curvature singularity. We obtain analogous
results for other extended object solutions of supergravity theories.
