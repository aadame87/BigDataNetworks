  The $SU_{q}(n)$ generators are obtained as large spectral parameter limit of
the Yang-Baxter operators in the integrable $SU_{q}(n)$ invariant vertex model.
The commutation relations, including Serre relations, are obtained as limits of
the Yang-Baxter equations. The recently found eigenvectors of the $SU_{q}(n)$
invariant spin chains are shown to be Highest Weight vectors of the
corresponding quantum group.
