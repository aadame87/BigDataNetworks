Title: Effective Interactions of Planar Fermions in a Strong Magnetic Field-the
  Effect of Landau Level Mixing
Authors: Rashmi Ray and Gil Gat
Comments: 15 pages, plain tex
\\
  We obtain expressions for the current operator in the lowest Landau level
(L.L.L.) field theory, where higher Landau level mixing due to various external
and interparticle interactions is sytematically taken into account. We consider
the current operators in the presence of electromagnetic interactions, both
Coulomb and time-dependent, as well as local four-fermi interactions. The
importance of Landau level mixing for long-range interactions is especially
emphasized. We also calculate the edge-current for a finite sample.
