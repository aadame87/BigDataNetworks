  The absence of fermion kinetic terms in supersymmetric-BF gauge theories is
established. We do this by means of explicit off-shell (superspace)
constructions. As part of our study we give the superspace constraints for D=3,
N=4 super Yang-Mills along with the D=3, N=4 superconformal algebra. The puzzle
we are interested in solving is the fact that the topological cousins, known as
super-BF gauge theories, of certain supersymmetric-BF theories have kinetic
terms for the twisted fermions. We show that the map which takes the latter to
the former includes a Hodge decomposition of the twisted fermions. In
conjunction with this result, we argue that it is natural to modify the naive
path integral measure of supersymmetric-BF theories to include the Ray-Singer
analytic torsion.
