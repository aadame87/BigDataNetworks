  A set of compatible formulas for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the
quantum algebra $U_{q}({\rm su}_2)$ is given in this paper. These formulas are
$q$-deformations of known formulas, as for instance: Wigner, van der Waerden,
and Racah formulas. They serve as starting points for deriving various
realizations of the unit tensor of $U_{q}({\rm su}_2)$ in terms of $q$-boson
operators. The passage from the one-parameter quantum algebra $U_{q }({\rm
su}_2)$ to the two-parameter quantum algebra $U_{qp}({\rm u}_2)$ is discussed
at the level of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
