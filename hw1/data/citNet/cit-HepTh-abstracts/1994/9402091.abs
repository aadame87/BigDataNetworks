  We compute, by free field techniques, the scalar product of the SU(2)
Chern-Simons states on genus > 1 surfaces. The result is a finite-dimensional
integral over positions of ``screening charges'' and one complex modular
parameter. It uses an effective description of the CS states closely related to
the one worked out by Bertram. The scalar product formula allows to express the
higher genus partition functions of the WZW conformal field theory by
finite-dimensional integrals. It should provide the hermitian metric preserved
by the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection describing the variations of
the CS states under the change of the complex structure of the surface.
