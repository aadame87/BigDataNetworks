  Matrix models of 2d quantum gravity coupled to matter field are investigated
by the renormalized perturbational method, in which the matrix model
Hamiltonian is represented by the equivalent vector model. By the saddle point
method, the renormalization group beta-function is obtained in the successive
approximation.
