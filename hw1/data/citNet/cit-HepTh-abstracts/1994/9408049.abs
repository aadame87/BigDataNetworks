  We show that the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation can be
written as a constrained super KP flow in a nonstandard representation of the
Lax equation. We construct the conserved charges and show that this system
reduces to the super mKdV equation with appropriate identifications. We
construct various flows generated by the general nonstandard super Lax equation
and show that they contain both the KP and mKP flows in the bosonic limits.
This nonstandard supersymmetric KP hierarchy allows us to construct a new super
KP equation which is nonlocal.
