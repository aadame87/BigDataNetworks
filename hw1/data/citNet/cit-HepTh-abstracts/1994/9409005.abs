  We investigate the quantum nucleation of pairs of charged circular cosmic
strings in de Sitter space. By including self-gravity we obtain the classical
potential energy barrier and compute the quantum mechanical tunneling
probability in the semiclassical approximation. We also discuss the classical
evolution of charged circular strings after their nucleation.
