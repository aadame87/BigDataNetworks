  We relate the Teichmuller spaces obtained by Hitchin to the Teichmuller
spaces of $WA_{n}$-gravity. The relationship of this space to $W$-gravity is
obtained by identifying the flat $PSL(n+1,{\BR})$ connections of Hitchin to
generalised vielbeins and connections. This is explicitly demonstrated for
$WA_2=W_3$ gravity. We show how $W$-diffeomorphisms are obtained in this
formulation. We find that particular combinations of the generalised connection
play the role of projective connections. We thus obtain $W$-diffeomorphisms in
a geometric fashion without invoking the presence of matter fields. This
description in terms of vielbeins naturally provides the measure for the
gravity sector in the Polyakov path integral for $W$-strings.
