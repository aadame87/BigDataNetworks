Title: World-sheet aspects of mirror symmetry
Authors: Mans Henningson
Comments: 12 pages, YCTP-P13-94
\\
  (Talk given at the Oskar Klein centenary symposium 19-21 September 1994 in
Stockholm, Sweden, to appear in the proceedings.) The first half of this talk
is a non-technical discussion of some general aspects of string theory, in
particular the problem of compactification. We also give an introduction to
mirror symmetry. The second half is a brief account of two recent papers on
this subject; one by the author on mirror symmetry for Kazama-Suzuki models and
one by P. Berglund and the author on a search for possible mirror pairs of
Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds.
