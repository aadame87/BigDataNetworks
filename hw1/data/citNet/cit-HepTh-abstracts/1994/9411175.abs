  The Aharonov-Bohm scattering of a localized wave packet is considered. A
careful analysis of the forward direction points out new results: according to
the time-dependent solution obtained by means of the asymptotic representation
for the propagator (kernel), a phenomenon of auto-interference occurs along the
forward direction, where, also, the probability density current is evaluated
and found finite.
